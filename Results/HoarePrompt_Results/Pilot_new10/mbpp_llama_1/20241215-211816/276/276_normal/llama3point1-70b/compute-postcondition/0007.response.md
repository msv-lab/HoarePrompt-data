To determine the output state, we need to consider the conditions given for calculating the `median`. The `median` calculation depends on whether `size` is even or odd.

1. If `size` is even, the `median` is the average of the two middle elements in `merged_list`, which are `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`.
2. If `size` is odd, the `median` is the middle element, which, given `middle_index` is `size - 1`, would be `merged_list[size - 1]`.

Given that `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`, and that `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order, the `merged_list` will also be in ascending order.

Since `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and this index is used to determine the median, we consider the value at this index in `merged_list` for both even and odd cases of `size`.

For an even `size`, the program returns the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. 
For an odd `size`, it returns `merged_list[size - 1]`.

Output State: **The program returns the median of the merged list, which is either the average of the two middle elements if `size` is even, or the middle element if `size` is odd, from a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
