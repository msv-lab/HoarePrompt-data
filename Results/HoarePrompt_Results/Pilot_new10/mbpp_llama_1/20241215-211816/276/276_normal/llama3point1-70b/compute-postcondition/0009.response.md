The function func_1 accepts three parameters: two sorted lists of integers (list1 and list2) and their common length (size). 

Looking at the code line by line, the function merges the two lists into one, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median. 

If the size of the lists is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements. However, in the given code, the middle index is calculated as size - 1. 

If the size is odd, the median is the middle element, which in the given code is also accessed using the index size - 1.

The code does not handle the case where the input lists are not sorted or where the size parameter does not match the lengths of the lists. 

The code also assumes that the input lists are not empty, as it does not check for this case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function includes calculating the median of the merged list, but it also assumes certain preconditions about the input (sorted lists, matching size) and does not include error checking for these conditions.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of integers and their common length, merges and sorts the lists, and returns the median of the merged list, either as the average of the two middle elements if the length is even or the middle element if the length is odd, assuming the input lists are sorted and non-empty and the length parameter matches the list lengths. **
