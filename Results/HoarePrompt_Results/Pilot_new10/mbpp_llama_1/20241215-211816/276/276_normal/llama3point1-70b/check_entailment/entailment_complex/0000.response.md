Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the provided program has an issue with calculating the median when the total size of the two lists is even.

In the case where the total size of the two lists is even, the program calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements of the merged list. However, the calculation of the middle index is incorrect.

The middle index should be `size` (or `size + size // 2`) instead of `size - 1` because the merged list has a total size of `2 * size`. If `size` is even, the middle index should be `size` to get the first middle element and `size + 1` to get the second middle element. 

Here's why the current program does not do what the problem description asks for:

Let's consider two lists `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`. Both lists are sorted and of the same size.

When we merge these lists, we get `merged_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. Since the total size of the merged list is even, we need to calculate the median as the average of the two middle elements.

However, in the program, `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is `1` in this case. Therefore, the program calculates the median as `(merged_list[1] + merged_list[2]) / 2`, which is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

This is correct, but it's just a coincidence. If we consider two lists `list1 = [1, 3, 5]` and `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`, the merged list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Here, `middle_index` is calculated as `2` (because `size` is `3`), so the program calculates the median as `(merged_list[2] + merged_list[3]) / 2`, which is `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`. This is also correct, but it's still a coincidence.

The issue arises when we consider the case where the total size of the two lists is odd. In this case, the middle index should be `size` (or `size + size // 2`) to get the middle element.

To fix this issue, we can modify the program to calculate the middle index correctly. We can use the total size of the merged list (`2 * size`) to calculate the middle index.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    total_size = 2 * size
    middle_index = total_size // 2
    if total_size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the middle index as `total_size // 2`, which gives us the correct index for both even and odd total sizes. If the total size is even, we calculate the median as the average of the two middle elements. If the total size is odd, we calculate the median as the middle element.
