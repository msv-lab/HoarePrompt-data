Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly when the two input lists are of the same size, but the total size of the merged list is even. In this case, the median should be the average of the two middle numbers in the merged list, but the program calculates it incorrectly.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The size of each list is 2, so the total size is 4, which is even. The program calculates the median as `(merged_list[1] + merged_list[2]) / 2 = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is correct. However, if we change the lists to `list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]` and `list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. The size of each list is 4, so the total size is 8, which is even. The program calculates the median as `(merged_list[3] + merged_list[4]) / 2 = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5`, which is correct. But if we pass size = 4 to the function the program calculates the median as `(merged_list[3] + merged_list[4]) / 2 = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5` which is correct but it assumes that the total size is always the `2*size` and does not handle cases correctly when size of each list is different. So if size is not `2*size` the function will not work correctly. So the function does not work correctly when the size of the lists are not the same. 

However the description of the problem specifically says "Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size." so it handles cases where size of the input lists are same but there is a better way to solve it without passing the size as a parameter and the code could be simplified by using a loop to find middle index since the size of the lists are same. 

However there is a logical error if size is not `2*size`. For example if `size = 3`, `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [4, 5, 6]` then `merged_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The program will calculate the median as `(merged_list[2] + merged_list[3]) / 2 = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5` which is correct because the size of the `merged_list` is 6 which is even, but it should have taken middle_index = 2 if size = 3 was correct input. So this example will throw an error and the code will not work as expected.

The code should be modified to handle cases where the size of the input lists may not be known before. In that case the code can be simplified as:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    size = len(merged_list)
    middle_index = size // 2
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
