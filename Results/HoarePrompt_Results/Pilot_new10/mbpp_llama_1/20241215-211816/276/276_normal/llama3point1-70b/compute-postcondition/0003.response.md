To determine the output state, we should consider the impact of the given code on the variables and their relationships as described in the initial state.

The initial state gives us the following information:
- `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order.
- Each list has a length of `size`.
- `size` is a positive integer and is even (`size % 2 == 0`).
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`.
- `middle_index` is `size - 1`.

Given the code:
```python
median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
```

This code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by averaging the two middle elements, since the total number of elements in `merged_list` is even (`2 * size`).

The key points to consider are:
- `merged_list` has an even length, so its median is the average of the two central values.
- `middle_index` is set to `size - 1`, which correctly points to the first of the two central elements in `merged_list` when considering its length is `2 * size`.

The calculation of `median` does not alter `list1`, `list2`, `size`, `merged_list`, or `middle_index`. It introduces a new variable, `median`, which is the average of the two middle elements of `merged_list`.

Therefore, the output state includes all initial conditions plus the new condition for `median`:
- `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`.
- `size` is a positive integer and is even.
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`.
- `middle_index` is `size - 1`.
- `median` is the average of the two middle elements of `merged_list`, calculated as `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer and is even; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`; `median` is `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`**
