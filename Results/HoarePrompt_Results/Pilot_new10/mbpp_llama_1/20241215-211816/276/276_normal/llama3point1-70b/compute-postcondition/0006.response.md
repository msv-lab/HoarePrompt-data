Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, the `median` is the average of the two middle elements `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, the `median` is the middle element `merged_list[size]` however since `middle_index` is `size - 1`, it can be written as `merged_list[size - 1]`.***
