Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly calculate the median for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the `middle_index`. The code uses `size - 1` as the `middle_index`, which is incorrect because the indices in Python are 0-based, meaning the middle index of a list of even length `size` would be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. 

For example, if the input lists are `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` (both of size 2), the merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The median of this list would be the average of the two middle elements, which are at indices 1 and 2. However, the code would incorrectly calculate the `middle_index` as `2 - 1 = 1`, and then try to access the element at index `1` and `1 + 1 = 2`, which is almost correct but due to the error in index calculation, it will not be correct for all cases.

To fix this, the `middle_index` should be calculated as `size - 1` when the size is odd, and the median should be calculated as the average of the elements at indices `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2` when the size is even. Here's the corrected code:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[size // 2 - 1] + merged_list[size // 2]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[size // 2]
    return median
```
Note that the `size` parameter should be the total size of the merged list, which is `2 * size` in this case, not the size of the individual lists.
