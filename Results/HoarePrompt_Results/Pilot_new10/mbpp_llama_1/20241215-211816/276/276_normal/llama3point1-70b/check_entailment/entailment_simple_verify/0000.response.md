To assess the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code, let's break down the key components:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
2. **Original Assessment**: None, meaning there was no initial evaluation provided.
3. **Program Code**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) and a size parameter, merges these lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median based on whether the total size of the merged list is even or odd.
4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations provide insight into the state of the program at different points, confirming that `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers, each of length `size`, and that the `merged_list` is a sorted combination of these two lists.
   - The calculation of the median is based on the `size` parameter. If `size` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements in the sorted `merged_list`. If `size` is odd, the median is the middle element.

Given the above information, the key aspect to assess is whether the program correctly calculates the median of the merged list of two sorted lists of the same size.

**Reasoning**:
- The `merged_list` is correctly created by combining `list1` and `list2` and sorting the result.
- The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is correct for accessing the middle element(s) in a list of length `2 * size` (since list indices start at 0).
- For even `size`, the median calculation is correct as it averages the two middle elements.
- For odd `size`, the median calculation seems to be based on `size - 1`, which aligns with accessing the middle element in a list where the total length is `2 * size` and `size` itself is odd. However, the comment suggests a potential misunderstanding in the explanation regarding even and odd `size` handling, but the code logic is actually correct given the `middle_index` calculation.

**Conclusion**: The original assessment was "None," implying no evaluation was provided. Based on the problem description and the annotated code, the program appears to correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The logic for handling both even and odd-sized lists is implemented correctly in the code, despite a potential for confusion in the explanatory comments regarding indexing and size parity.

Final: **True**
