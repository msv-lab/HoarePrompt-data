The original assessment and the annotated version of the code both support the correctness of the provided function `func_1` based on the problem description. The function is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`. The original assessment correctly points out that the function iterates through the array from left to right, ensuring it finds the first occurrence of `num`, and returns `-1` if `num` is not found. The annotated version of the code aligns with this explanation, detailing the state of the program before and after the function call, and confirming the return behavior.

The key points to consider are:
- The function iterates through the array from start to end, which means it will find the first occurrence of `num`.
- The function returns the index of `num` as soon as it encounters it, fulfilling the requirement of finding the "first" occurrence.
- If `num` is not found in the array, the function returns `-1`, which is a common convention to indicate that an element was not found.

The original assessment also correctly notes that while the function works for sorted and unsorted arrays, a more efficient solution using binary search could be implemented specifically for sorted arrays, improving the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

However, the question seems to ask about the correctness of the function based on the problem description, not about its efficiency or optimal implementation for all possible scenarios (like sorted arrays). The function provided does indeed meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment that the function is correct is accurate based on the information provided and the assumptions about the input being valid.

Final: **True**
