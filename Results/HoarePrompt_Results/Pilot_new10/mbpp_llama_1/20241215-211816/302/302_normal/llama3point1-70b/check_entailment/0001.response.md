Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It simply returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number in the array, without considering whether the array is sorted or not.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array is not sorted. For example, if the input array is [3, 1, 2, 3, 4] and the target number is 3, the program will return 0, which is the index of the first occurrence of 3 in the array. However, since the array is not sorted, the function should ideally raise an error or return a special value to indicate that the input array is not valid.

Additionally, the problem description does not specify what to do if the input array is empty. The function will return -1 in this case, which may or may not be the desired behavior.

However, if we assume that the input array will always be sorted and non-empty, the function is correct. It iterates over the array and returns the index of the first element that matches the target number, or -1 if no such element is found. 

Here's an example of how you could modify the function to handle these edge cases:

```python
def func_1(arr, num):
    if not arr:
        raise ValueError("Input array is empty")
    if arr!= sorted(arr):
        raise ValueError("Input array is not sorted")
    try:
        return arr.index(num)
    except ValueError:
        return -1
```
