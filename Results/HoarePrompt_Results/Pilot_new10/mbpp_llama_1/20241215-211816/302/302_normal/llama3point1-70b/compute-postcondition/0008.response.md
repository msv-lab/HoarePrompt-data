Given the initial state, we have the following information: 
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements.
- `num` is an integer, but its value or relation to other variables is not specified.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is the third element in the list `arr`.

When the code `return i` is executed, it directly returns the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output State: **The program returns 2**
