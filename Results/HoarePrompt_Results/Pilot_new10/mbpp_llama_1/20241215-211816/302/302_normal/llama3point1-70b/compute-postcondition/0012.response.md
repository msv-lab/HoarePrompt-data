The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `num`. `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `num` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns an integer value based on certain conditions. The possible return values are 0, 1, 2, or -1. 

Since the specific conditions for each return value are not provided, we can conclude that the function's return value depends on the relationship between the input list `arr` and the integer `num`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and return an integer value based on the conditions met by the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and returns an integer value of 0, 1, 2, or -1 based on the conditions met by the inputs.**
