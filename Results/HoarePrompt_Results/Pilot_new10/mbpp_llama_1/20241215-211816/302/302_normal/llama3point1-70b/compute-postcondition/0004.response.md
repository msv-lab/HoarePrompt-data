To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):`, which means the loop will iterate over the `arr` list, with `i` being the index and `x` being the value at that index.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `num` is an integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is the first element in the list.
- `x` is not equal to `num`.

Since the loop has already executed once (at `i = 0`), for it to execute again, the following conditions must be met:
- `arr` must have at least 2 elements because the loop needs to move to the next element.
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- `x` should be the next element in the list, which is the second element since `i` is now 1.

The state of `num` does not affect the loop's ability to execute; it's part of the loop body's logic, not the loop control logic.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is an integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list**
