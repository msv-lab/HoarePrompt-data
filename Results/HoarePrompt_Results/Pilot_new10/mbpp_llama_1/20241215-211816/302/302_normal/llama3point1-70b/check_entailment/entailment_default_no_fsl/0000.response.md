Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's why the function is correct for every potential case:

1. **Sorted Array Requirement**: The problem statement mentions a sorted array. Although the function itself does not explicitly check for the array being sorted, the correctness of its operation (finding the first occurrence of a number) does not inherently depend on the array being sorted, given that it simply iterates through the array from start to end.

2. **First Occurrence**: The function correctly finds the first occurrence of the given number by iterating through the array from left to right (from the start) and returning the index as soon as it encounters the specified number.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Number at the start of the array**: The function will correctly return index 0, as the `enumerate` function returns the index of each element starting from 0, and the loop breaks as soon as it finds the match.
   - **Number at the middle or end of the array**: The function will return the correct index of the first occurrence because it iterates through each element and stops at the first match.
   - **Number not in the array**: The function returns -1, indicating that the number was not found, which aligns with the problem description's requirement for handling such a case.

4. **Implicit Return**: Although the output hints suggest an implicit return of `None`, this seems to be a misunderstanding. The code explicitly returns `-1` when the number is not found in the array, matching the intention stated in the code.

Given these points, the function appears to correctly handle all potential cases as described by the problem. The hints provided about edge cases and the general functionality of the code match the expected behavior based on the code itself. Therefore, the function is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
