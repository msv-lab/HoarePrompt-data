According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `arr` is a sorted list of integers and `num` is an integer. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0 (the index of the first element in the list), and `x` is the first element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num` is an integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list**
