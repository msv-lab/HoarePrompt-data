To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze its behavior for all potential cases.

The problem description requires writing a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Here's the annotated program provided:
```python
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    return -1
```

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Sorted Array Input**: The function assumes that the input array `arr` is sorted. This is crucial for its correctness because the problem description does not explicitly require the function to handle unsorted arrays.

2. **Finding the First Occurrence**: The function iterates through the sorted array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element. As soon as it finds a match (`x == num`), it returns the index `i`. This ensures that it returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` because it doesn't continue searching after finding the first match.

3. **Handling the Case When `num` is Not in `arr`**: If the loop completes without finding `num` in `arr`, the function returns `-1`. This is a common convention to indicate that the element was not found.

### Conclusion

The function does exactly what the problem description asks for every potential case:

- It finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
- If the number is not found, it returns `-1`, indicating that the number is not in the array.

Given the assumptions that the input array is sorted and the function behaves as expected for both cases (when the number is found and when it is not), the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
