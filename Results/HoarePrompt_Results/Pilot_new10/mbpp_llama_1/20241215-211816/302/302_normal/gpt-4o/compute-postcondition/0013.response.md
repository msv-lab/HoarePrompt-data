Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is set to `mid`, and `high` is updated to `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, and `result` remains -1. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `result` remains -1. In all cases, `mid` remains `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.**
