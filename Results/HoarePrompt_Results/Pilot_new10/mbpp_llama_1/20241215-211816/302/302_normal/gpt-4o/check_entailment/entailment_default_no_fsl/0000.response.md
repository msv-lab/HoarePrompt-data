Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a binary search algorithm that finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code works:

1. The program starts by initializing two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. It then enters a while loop that continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
3. Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index of the current range (`mid = (low + high) // 2`).
4. If the element at the middle index is equal to the target, it updates the `result` variable with the middle index and moves the `high` pointer to the left of the middle index (`high = mid - 1`). This ensures that the program continues searching for the first occurrence of the target on the left side of the middle index.
5. If the element at the middle index is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to the right of the middle index (`low = mid + 1`). This is because all elements to the left of the middle index are less than the target, so the first occurrence of the target must be on the right side.
6. If the element at the middle index is greater than the target, it moves the `high` pointer to the left of the middle index (`high = mid - 1`). This is because all elements to the right of the middle index are greater than the target, so the first occurrence of the target must be on the left side.
7. Once the loop ends, the program returns the `result` variable, which is the index of the first occurrence of the target if found, or -1 if not found.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program. For example, `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)` returns 1, which is the index of the first occurrence of 5 in the array. 

Additionally, the program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the target is not found in the array (in which case it returns -1) or when the array contains duplicate elements (in which case it returns the index of the first occurrence of the target).

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
