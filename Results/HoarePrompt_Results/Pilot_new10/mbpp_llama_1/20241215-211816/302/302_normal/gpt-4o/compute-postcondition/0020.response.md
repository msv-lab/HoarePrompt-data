Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `high` remains the same. Otherwise, `low` remains less than or equal to the original `high`, and `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.***
