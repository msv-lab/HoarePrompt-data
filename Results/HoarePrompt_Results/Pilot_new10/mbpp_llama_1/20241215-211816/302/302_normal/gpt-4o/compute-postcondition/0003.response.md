To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the middle index of the current range defined by `low` and `high` in the list `arr`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `result` is -1.

The calculation of `mid` as `(low + high) // 2` implies that `mid` will be the integer part of the average of `low` and `high`, effectively giving us the middle index of the current search range in the list.

Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `mid` will be `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. This means `mid` will be the index of the middle element of the list `arr` when considering the entire list.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code will include the updated value of `mid`, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.**
