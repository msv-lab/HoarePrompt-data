You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

I have evaluated the provided code for the function `func_1` which is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The algorithm used is a modified binary search that not only finds the target number but continues to search for it on the left side after the first occurrence is found. This ensures that it identifies the first occurrence rather than just any occurrence of the target number.

The provided code:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```
handles the search by maintaining a `result` variable that stores the index of the last found occurrence of the target. As long as `arr[mid]` equals the target, it updates `result` and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`, effectively searching for a potential first occurrence to the left of `mid`. 

If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search the right half. If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, it adjusts the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching in the left half.

Given the logic and the examples provided:
- The function starts by considering the entire array (`low = 0` and `high = len(arr) - 1`).
- It then follows the binary search approach, adjusting `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and the `target`.
- If `arr[mid]` equals the `target`, it updates `result` with `mid` and continues searching to the left by adjusting `high` to `mid - 1`, ensuring the first occurrence is found.

All the assertions provided in the problem description also validate the correctness of the function:
- `assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1`
- `assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2`
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4`

These assertions cover different scenarios, including when the target number appears multiple times and when it appears only once, demonstrating that `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Therefore, based on the provided code, explanations, and assertions, I conclude that the program is correct and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is greater than `high`, if `target` is in `arr`, then `result` is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`, otherwise `result` is -1
    return result
    #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` is in `arr`, otherwise it returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1, assuming that `arr` is sorted and contains only integer elements

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
