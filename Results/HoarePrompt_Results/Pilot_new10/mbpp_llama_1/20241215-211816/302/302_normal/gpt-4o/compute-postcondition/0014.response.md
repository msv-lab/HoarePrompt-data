To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions and updates based on the given `while` loop statement: `while low <= high:`.

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. This means for the loop to execute again, this condition must hold true after the previous iteration.

2. **Updates Based on Conditions**:
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is set to `mid`, and `high` is updated to `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) - 1`. This update implies that even if `target` is found, the loop could potentially continue if `low` is less than or equal to the new `high`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. For the loop to continue, `low` (which is now `mid + 1`) must be less than or equal to `high`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to the new `high` (`mid - 1`).

3. **Analysis of State Adjustments Needed**:
   - Given `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers and `mid` remains `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, for the loop to execute again, we must ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high` after any of the updates.
   - The critical point is the value of `mid` and how `low` and `high` are updated relative to it. Since `mid` is fixed at `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, for `low` to be less than or equal to `high` after an update, we must consider the maximum value `high` can take after an update and ensure `low` does not exceed it.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time involve ensuring that `low` and `high` maintain a relationship where `low` is less than or equal to `high` after any update. This requires no change to the nature of `arr` being a non-empty sorted list or `target` being an integer but rather an understanding of how `low` and `high` are updated relative to `mid` and each other.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
