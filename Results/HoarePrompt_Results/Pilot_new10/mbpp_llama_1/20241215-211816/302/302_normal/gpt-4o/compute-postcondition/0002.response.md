To execute the `while` loop at least one time, the condition `low <= high` must be met. Given the state right before the loop:

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers
- `target` is an integer
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `result` is -1

For the loop to execute, the condition `low <= high` needs to be satisfied. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, the only way this condition could potentially not be met is if `arr` is an empty list, because then `high` would be -1 (since `len(arr) - 1` would be -1 when `len(arr)` is 0), making `low` (0) greater than `high` (-1).

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least one time, we need to adjust the state so that `arr` is not empty. This means `arr` must have at least one element, which in turn means `len(arr)` must be greater than 0. As a result, `high` would be at least 0, satisfying the condition `low <= high` because `low` is 0.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `result` is -1**
