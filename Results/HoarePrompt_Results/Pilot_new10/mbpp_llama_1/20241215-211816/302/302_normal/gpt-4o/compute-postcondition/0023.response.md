To solve this problem, we first analyze the given code and the initial state. The initial state is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after any updates based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`. The code provided is:

```python
mid = (low + high) // 2
```

This line of code calculates the middle index of the current range `[low, high]` in the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `mid`.

Given that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, we can infer that `mid` will always be an integer value that falls within the range of indices of `arr`, since `arr` is non-empty and sorted.

Now, analyzing the impact of the code on the program:

1. **The value of `mid` is calculated and updated**: It becomes the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest integer because of the floor division operator `//`.

2. **The states of `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high` are not changed by the code**: These variables retain their values from the initial state.

3. **The relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid`**: After the calculation, `mid` will be either equal to `low` (if `low` equals `high`), or it will be closer to `low` than to `high` if `low` is less than `high`, due to the nature of integer division in Python.

Considering these points, the output state can be described as follows:

- `arr` remains a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` remains an integer.
- `low` and `high` retain their initial relationship and values, with `low` being less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is now defined as the integer value resulting from the calculation `(low + high) // 2`, effectively being the middle index or leaning towards the lower index if the sum of `low` and `high` is odd.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`.**
