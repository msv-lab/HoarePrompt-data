Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `mid` is updated to be the average of the new `low` and `high`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `mid` is updated to be the average of the original `low` and the new `high`, while keeping the original relation that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.***
