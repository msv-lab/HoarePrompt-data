The value of `result` is updated to `mid`. Since `arr[mid]` equals `target`, `mid` is the index of `target` in `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is `mid`, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`**
