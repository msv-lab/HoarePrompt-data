The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `high` can be expressed in terms of the old `low` and `high` as follows: `high = ((low + high) // 2) - 1`. The precondition that `low` is less than or equal to `high` may not hold after the update, but it is still the case that `low` is less than or equal to the original `high`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to the original `high`, `high` is `mid - 1` which equals `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
