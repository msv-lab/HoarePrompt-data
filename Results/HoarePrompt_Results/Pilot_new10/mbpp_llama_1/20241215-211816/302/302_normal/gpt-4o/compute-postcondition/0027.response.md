To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state:

- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` and `high` are such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`.

The given code is `high = mid - 1`. This means the value of `high` is updated to be one less than the current value of `mid`.

Given that `mid = (low + high) // 2`, after executing `high = mid - 1`, the new value of `high` becomes `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. However, since `high` has changed, the expression for `mid` would also change if it were to be recalculated based on the new `high`. But in this specific step, only `high` is updated, and there's no subsequent recalculation of `mid` shown.

So, the output state after executing the given code is:

- `arr` remains a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` remains an integer.
- `low` remains less than or equal to the new `high`.
- `mid` equals `(low + (original high)) // 2`, but since `high` has been updated to `mid - 1`, if `mid` were to be updated based on the new `high`, its value would change. However, as per the given code, only `high` is directly updated.
- `high` is now `mid - 1`, which can also be expressed as `(low + high) // 2 - 1` before the update of `high`, but after the update, it's simply the new value `mid - 1`.

Therefore, considering only the direct update and not recalculating `mid` based on the new `high`:

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` equals `(low + (original high)) // 2`, and `high` equals `mid - 1`.**
