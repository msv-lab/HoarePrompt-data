Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `result` is -1. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, then `low` remains 0 and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` remains `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.***
