The original assessment claims that the provided code is correct and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description. The annotated version of the code also describes the states at different parts of the program, which are consistent with the original assessment.

Upon reviewing the code and the annotations, it appears that the function `func_1` correctly implements a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The algorithm updates the `result` variable whenever it finds the target number and then continues searching to the left to ensure that it finds the first occurrence.

The provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function, covering different scenarios such as when the target number appears multiple times and when it appears only once.

Based on the provided code, explanations, assertions, and annotations, I conclude that the program is correct and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

The reason I keep the original assessment is that the code correctly implements the modified binary search algorithm, and the annotations provide a clear description of the program's state at different points. The assertions also demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios.

Final: **True**
