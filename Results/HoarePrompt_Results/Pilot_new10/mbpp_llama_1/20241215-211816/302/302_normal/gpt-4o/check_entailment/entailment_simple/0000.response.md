Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1` finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function uses a binary search approach, which is suitable for finding an element in a sorted array.
2. When `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, the function updates `result` with `mid` and then sets `high` to `mid - 1`. This ensures that the function continues searching for the first occurrence of `target` on the left side of `mid`.
3. The function returns `result`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` is found, and `-1` otherwise.
4. The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `target` is not present in `arr` or when `arr` contains duplicate elements.
5. The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios.

The program's correctness can be attributed to its implementation of a modified binary search algorithm, which is designed to find the first occurrence of a target element in a sorted array. By repeatedly dividing the search space in half and adjusting the search boundaries, the function efficiently locates the first occurrence of the target element.

In general, this program will always do what the problem description says because it adheres to the principles of binary search and correctly handles the edge cases that may arise when searching for the first occurrence of a target element in a sorted array.
