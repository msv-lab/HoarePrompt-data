Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. It calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list of integers.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Handling non-repeated elements**: The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the input list `lst`. It checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1 using the `count()` method. If the count is 1, it means `i` appears only once in the list, and it is included in the sum.

2. **Handling empty list**: If the input list `lst` is empty, the `sum()` function will return 0, which is the expected result for an empty list.

3. **Handling duplicate or unique integers**: The function correctly handles cases where the list contains duplicate or unique integers. It only includes integers that appear once in the list in the sum.

4. **Handling non-integer values or non-list input**: Although the function may raise errors if the input list contains non-integer values or is not a list, this is not explicitly forbidden by the problem description. The problem description only asks for a function that finds the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, without specifying how to handle invalid input.

In summary, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases involving lists of integers. It calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the list, handles empty lists, and correctly handles cases with duplicate or unique integers.
