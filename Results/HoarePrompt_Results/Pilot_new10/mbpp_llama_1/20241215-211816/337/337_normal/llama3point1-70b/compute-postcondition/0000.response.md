The given code snippet is a return statement that uses a generator expression to sum up all the unique integers in the list `lst`. The uniqueness of an integer is determined by the `count` method of the list, which returns the number of occurrences of the integer in the list. If the count is 1, it means the integer appears only once in the list.

Given that `lst` is a list of integers, the program will return the sum of all integers that appear only once in the list.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear only once.**
