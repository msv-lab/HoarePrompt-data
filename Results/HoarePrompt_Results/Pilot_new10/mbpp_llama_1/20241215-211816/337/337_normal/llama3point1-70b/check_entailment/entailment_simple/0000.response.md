Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description's requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over the list.
3. For each element `i` in the list, it checks if the count of `i` in the list is equal to 1 using `lst.count(i) == 1`.
4. If the count is 1, it means `i` appears only once in the list, so it is included in the sum.
5. The `sum` function then adds up all the non-repeated elements, and the result is returned by the function.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Lists with multiple non-repeated elements
- Lists with repeated elements
- Empty lists (in which case the function will return 0)
- Lists with a single element (in which case the function will return that element)

Therefore, the program accurately meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, making it correct.
