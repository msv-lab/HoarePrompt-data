Correctness: **False**

The code is almost correct, but it does not handle cases where the input list contains non-integer values or is not a list. If the input list contains a non-integer value, the `count()` method will still work, but the `sum()` function will throw an error if it encounters a non-integer value. Additionally, if the input is not a list, the `count()` and `sum()` functions will throw errors. The code does not include any error checking or handling for these cases.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 'a', 2]`, the code will throw an error when trying to sum up the elements, because `'a'` is not an integer. Similarly, if the input is not a list, such as `(1, 2, 2)`, the code will throw an error when trying to call the `count()` method.

To make the code correct, it should include error checking and handling to ensure that the input is a list and that all elements in the list are integers. 

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not isinstance(lst, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    if not all(isinstance(i, int) for i in lst):
        raise TypeError("All elements in the list must be integers")
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

This modified code will raise an error if the input is not a list or if any of the elements in the list are not integers, making it more robust and correct.
