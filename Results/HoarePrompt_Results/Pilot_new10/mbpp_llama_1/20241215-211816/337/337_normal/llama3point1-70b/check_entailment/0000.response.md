Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the count of that element in the list is equal to 1 using the `lst.count(i)` method. If an element appears only once, it is included in the sum.

The reason this function is correct is that it accurately implements the requirement as described. It correctly identifies elements that appear only once in the list (non-repeated elements) and sums them up. The logic is straightforward and handles all potential cases as expected:

1. **Handling Unique Elements:** If all elements in the list are unique, every element will be counted once, and the sum of the list will be returned, which is the expected behavior since all elements are non-repeated.
2. **Handling Repeated Elements:** If a list contains repeated elements, only elements that appear once will be included in the sum. Elements that appear more than once will be excluded.
3. **Handling Empty Lists:** If an empty list is provided, the function will return 0, as the sum of no elements is 0. This aligns with the expectation since there are no elements to sum.
4. **Handling Lists with Negative Numbers or Zero:** The function will correctly sum negative numbers and zero if they appear as non-repeated elements in the list.

Given the thoroughness of the function's logic and its ability to handle various edge cases, the conclusion is that the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
