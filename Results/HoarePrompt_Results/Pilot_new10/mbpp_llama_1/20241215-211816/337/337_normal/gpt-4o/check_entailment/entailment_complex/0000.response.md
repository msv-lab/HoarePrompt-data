Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, which means it wants to sum up the elements that appear only once in the list. However, the given program calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, which is not the same as summing only the non-repeated elements.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, the program will return `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, which is the sum of all unique integers. But the correct sum of non-repeated elements should be `1`, because only the number `1` appears once in the list.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should count the occurrences of each element in the list, and then sum up only the elements that appear once. Here's an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in counts.items() if count == 1)
```
This implementation uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element, and then sums up only the elements that appear once using a generator expression.
