#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    #The program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, and returns this sum. If the list is empty, it returns 0. However, if the list contains non-integer values, it will throw an error, as it does not handle such cases.
