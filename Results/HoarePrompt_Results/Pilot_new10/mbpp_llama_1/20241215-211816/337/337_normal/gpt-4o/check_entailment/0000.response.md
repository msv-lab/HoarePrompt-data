Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem asks to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, but the provided function calculates the sum of unique elements, which is not the same.

For example, consider the list [1, 2, 2, 3]. The sum of non-repeated elements is 1 + 3 = 4, but the function will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. This is because the function treats all unique elements as non-repeated, whereas the problem statement asks for elements that appear only once in the list.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to count the frequency of each element and only include elements with a frequency of 1 in the sum. Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == 1)
```
