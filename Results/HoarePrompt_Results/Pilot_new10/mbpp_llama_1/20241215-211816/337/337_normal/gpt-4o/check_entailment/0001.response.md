Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The issue lies in the line where it uses the `set()` function to remove duplicates and then sums the resulting set. This approach sums all unique elements, not just the non-repeated ones.

For example, consider the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`. The sum of non-repeated elements here should be `2 + 4 = 6` because `1` and `3` are repeated. However, the given program will calculate the sum as `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to count the occurrences of each element and only include elements that appear exactly once in the sum. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return sum(key for key, value in counts.items() if value == 1)
```

This corrected version accurately calculates the sum of non-repeated elements by first counting the occurrences of each number and then summing the numbers that appear only once.
