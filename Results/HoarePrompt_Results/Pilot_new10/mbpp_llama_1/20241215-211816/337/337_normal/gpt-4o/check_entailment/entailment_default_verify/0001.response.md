To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the information given:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
2. **Provided Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       return sum(set(lst))
   ```
   This program uses a set to remove duplicate integers from the list and then sums the unique integers.
3. **Original Assessment**: None
4. **Output Hints**: The function calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list and returns this sum. If the list is empty, it returns 0. However, it does not handle non-integer values, which will cause an error.

The original assessment is absent, so we'll focus on whether the provided program meets the problem description based on the output hints.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for lists containing only integers. It uses a `set` to eliminate duplicate values and then sums the remaining unique integers. This approach is efficient and straightforward for the given task, assuming the input list only contains integers.

However, the output hints also mention that the function does not handle non-integer values, which could potentially cause an error. But since we are told to assume the input will be valid (i.e., the list will only contain integers and will not be empty, unless the problem specifically asks to handle such edge cases), this does not affect the correctness of the program with respect to the given problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided information and under the assumptions given (valid input), the program correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in a list.

Final: **True**
