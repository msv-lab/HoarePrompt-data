The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as parameters and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. The code uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples to achieve this. 

Upon examining the code and annotations, we notice that the code handles all potential cases where `elem` may or may not be present in `tup`, and it works correctly even if `tup` is empty or if `elem` is not a type that can be compared to elements in `tup` (in which case it simply returns 0, because `count` method in Python will return 0 if the element is not found). 

There are no apparent edge cases that the code does not handle, as the `count` method is designed to work with any type of element that can be compared, and it correctly returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`, handling all potential cases including empty tuples and elements of any comparable type. **
