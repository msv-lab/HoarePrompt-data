Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly implements the task of counting the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The `count()` method in Python returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple, which directly addresses the problem description.

This function will handle all potential cases, including:

1. **Empty tuples**: If the tuple is empty, `tup.count(elem)` will return `0`, as there are no elements in the tuple to match with `elem`.
2. **Elements of any comparable type**: The `count()` method in Python works with elements of any type that can be compared (i.e., it uses the `__eq__` method for comparison), meaning it will work correctly for tuples containing elements of various types (e.g., integers, strings, floating-point numbers).
3. **Multiple occurrences**: It will correctly count multiple occurrences of the same element in the tuple.
4. **Single occurrence or zero occurrences**: It will also correctly count a single occurrence or zero occurrences of the specified element.

The output hints agree with the functionality of the provided code, indicating that it handles all these potential cases and more, which aligns with the problem description. Given this analysis, the function behaves as expected for every potential case described in the problem and hinted at in the output hints.
