Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The `count` method in Python is a built-in method for sequences (such as tuples and lists) that returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the sequence.

Here's why the code works correctly in every case:

- It handles the element being present in the tuple one or more times: The `count` method will accurately return the number of occurrences.
- It handles the element being absent from the tuple: The `count` method will return 0, indicating the element is not found.
- It handles an empty tuple: The `count` method will still return 0 for any element, as there are no elements in the tuple to count.
- It handles the case where the element is `None` or any other type of object: The `count` method in Python works with any hashable type (and `None` is considered a unique object), so it will count occurrences of `None` or any other object correctly.

Since the function utilizes the `count` method, which is designed for this purpose and works correctly for all potential cases involving tuples and elements, the function itself is correct and serves its intended purpose.
