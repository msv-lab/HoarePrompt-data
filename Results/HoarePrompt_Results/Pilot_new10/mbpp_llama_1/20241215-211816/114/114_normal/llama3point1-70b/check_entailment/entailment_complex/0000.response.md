Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. 

The `count` method of Python tuples is used to count the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This method is capable of handling all potential cases, including:

- Empty tuples: The `count` method will return 0 when `tup` is an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior.
- Elements of any comparable type: The `count` method can handle elements of any type that can be compared using the equality operator (`==`).
- Duplicate elements: The `count` method correctly counts duplicate occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

Therefore, `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, making it a correct implementation.
