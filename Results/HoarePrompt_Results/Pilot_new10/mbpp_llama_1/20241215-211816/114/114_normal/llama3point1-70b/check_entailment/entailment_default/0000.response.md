Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple and straightforward implementation of the `count()` method in Python, which counts the number of occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. The function `func_1(tup, elem)` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input and returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`. 

This code correctly handles all potential cases, including empty tuples and elements of any comparable type. For example, if the tuple is empty, `tup.count(elem)` will correctly return 0, because there are no elements to count. If the element is of a primitive type like integer, string, or float, the `count()` method will correctly count its occurrences. The code also correctly works for tuples containing elements of different types, as long as the element being searched for is comparable to the elements in the tuple.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any potential edge cases that the code does not handle. Therefore, it appears that the code is correct and will work as expected for all potential inputs.
