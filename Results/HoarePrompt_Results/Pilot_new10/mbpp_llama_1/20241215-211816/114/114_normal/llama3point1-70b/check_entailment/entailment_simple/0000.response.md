Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the number of times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The `count` method of the tuple class in Python returns the number of occurrences of the specified element. So, `tup.count(elem)` will return the correct count of `elem` in `tup`.

This function will work correctly for any type of element that can be compared to the elements in the tuple, as specified in the problem description. It will also work for tuples of any size, and for any number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

For example, if you call `func_1((1, 2, 3, 2, 4), 2)`, it will return `2`, which is the correct count of `2` in the tuple. Similarly, if you call `func_1(("a", "b", "c", "b"), "b")`, it will return `2`, which is the correct count of `"b"` in the tuple.

In summary, the program is correct because it uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which accurately counts the occurrences of a specified element in the tuple. This meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and it will work correctly for all possible cases.
