The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

Looking at the code line by line, it appears that the function does exactly what the annotations say. There are no potential edge cases or missing logic that are not covered by the annotations.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle the case where `tup` is not a tuple or `element` is not a comparable object. If `tup` is not a tuple, the function will raise an AttributeError because the `count` method is not defined for non-tuple objects. If `element` is not a comparable object, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to compare `element` with the elements in `tup`.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `tup` is an empty tuple or `element` is not found in `tup`. In these cases, the function will return 0, which is the expected behavior.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`, handling cases where `tup` is not a tuple, `element` is not a comparable object, `tup` is an empty tuple, or `element` is not found in `tup`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. If `tup` is not a tuple, it raises an AttributeError. If `element` is not a comparable object, it raises a TypeError. If `tup` is an empty tuple or `element` is not found in `tup`, it returns 0. **
