The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. If `tup` is not a tuple, it raises an AttributeError. If `element` is not a comparable object, it raises a TypeError. If `tup` is an empty tuple or `element` is not found in `tup`, it returns 0.
