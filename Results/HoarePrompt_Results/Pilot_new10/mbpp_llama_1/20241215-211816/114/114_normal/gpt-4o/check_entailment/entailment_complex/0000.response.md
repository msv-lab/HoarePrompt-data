Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python function that takes in a tuple and an element, and counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. 

The provided function `func_1` does exactly this. It uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. 

Additionally, the function does not need to explicitly check if `tup` is a tuple or if `element` is a comparable object, as the `count` method will raise an `AttributeError` if `tup` is not a tuple and a `TypeError` if `element` is not a comparable object. 

If `tup` is an empty tuple or `element` is not found in `tup`, the `count` method will return 0, as expected.

Overall, the function correctly implements the required behavior, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
