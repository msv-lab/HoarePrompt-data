Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element as input and returns the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple.

The program uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. This method is efficient and accurate, making it suitable for this task.

The provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function. The function correctly returns 0 for an element that is not present in the tuple (4), and it correctly counts the occurrences of elements that are present in the tuple (10 and 8).

In general, the `count` method works correctly for all types of elements that can be compared with the elements in the tuple, including numbers, strings, and other immutable objects. This is because the `count` method uses the equality operator (`==`) to compare elements, which is defined for all comparable types in Python.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it is correct for every potential case.
