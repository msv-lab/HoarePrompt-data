Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of occurrences of the element in the tuple. This is exactly as described in the problem description.

The function uses the built-in `count` method of the tuple data type, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. This method is implemented correctly and works for all possible inputs.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. They test the function with different tuples and elements, and verify that it returns the expected counts.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles tuples of any length and elements of any type, and correctly counts the occurrences of the specified element. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
