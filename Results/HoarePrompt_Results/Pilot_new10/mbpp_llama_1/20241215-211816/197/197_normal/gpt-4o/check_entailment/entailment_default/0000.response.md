Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct as it does what the problem description says for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input and returns the total count of occurrences in the tuple for all elements present in the list. The code uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of each element in the list and then sums up these counts. 

The function handles empty inputs, duplicate elements in the list, and potentially other types of inputs correctly. The `assert` statements provided also confirm that the function works correctly for different test cases. 

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any cases where the function does not work correctly. The possibility of raising errors for non-hashable elements in the list is not a problem with the function itself, but rather a limitation of the `count` method, which is not relevant to the correctness of the function with respect to the problem description. 

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and test cases, it appears that the function `func_1` is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
