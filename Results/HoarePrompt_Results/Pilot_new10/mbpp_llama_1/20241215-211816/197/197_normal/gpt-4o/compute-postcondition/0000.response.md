The code snippet calculates the total count of occurrences of elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`. 

`count` is assigned the value of the sum of occurrences of each element from `elements` in `tup`. The states of `tup` and `elements` are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `tup` is a tuple, `elements` is a list, and `count` is the sum of occurrences of elements from `elements` in `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, `elements` is a list, `count` is equal to `sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)`**
