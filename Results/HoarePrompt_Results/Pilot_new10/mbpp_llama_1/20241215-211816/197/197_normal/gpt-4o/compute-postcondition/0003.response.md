Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, we can analyze the functionality of the function `func_1`. The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as parameters. It calculates the total count of occurrences in `tup` for all elements present in `elements` using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function.

Looking at the code, it does what the annotations say. It counts the occurrences of each element from `elements` in `tup` and returns the total count. However, there are potential edge cases to consider:

- If `tup` is not a tuple or `elements` is not a list, the function may still work but its behavior is not explicitly defined for other types.
- If `elements` contains elements that are not hashable (e.g., if `elements` contains lists, dictionaries, or other mutable types), the `count` method might not work as expected or could raise an error.
- If `tup` or `elements` are empty, the function will return 0, as there are no elements to count.
- The function does not handle cases where `elements` contains duplicate elements. Each duplicate element in `elements` will cause the `count` method to be called again for the same element in `tup`, effectively counting occurrences of that element multiple times in `tup`.

Considering all potential cases, including edge cases and the actual code behavior:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple and a list, and returns the total count of occurrences in the tuple for all elements present in the list, handling empty inputs, duplicate elements in the list, and potentially other types of inputs, but may raise errors for non-hashable elements in the list. **
