Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input, counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` in `tup` using the `count` method, and returns the sum of these counts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function iterates over each element in `lst` using a generator expression.
2. For each element, it calls the `count` method on `tup` to count the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple.
3. The `sum` function adds up these counts to produce the total count of elements from `lst` in `tup`.
4. If either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty inputs: If either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, which is the expected behavior.
* Overlapping elements: If an element appears multiple times in `lst`, the function will count each occurrence separately in `tup`.
* Unique elements: If an element appears only once in `lst`, the function will count its occurrences correctly in `tup`.

In summary, the program accurately implements the problem description and correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple.
