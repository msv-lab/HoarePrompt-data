Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the tuple. The function uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of occurrences of all elements in the list.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- It correctly handles cases where the list contains duplicate elements, as `tup.count(element)` is called for each element in the list.
- It correctly handles cases where the tuple contains duplicate elements, as `tup.count(element)` returns the total count of the element in the tuple.
- It correctly handles cases where an element is present in the list but not in the tuple, as `tup.count(element)` returns 0 for such elements.
- It correctly handles cases where the list and tuple are empty, as `sum` returns 0 for an empty iterable.

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), [2, 3, 4])`, the function returns 3, which is the correct count of occurrences of elements in the list (2 appears twice in the tuple and 3 appears once, while 4 appears 0 times).

Therefore, the function works as expected according to the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
