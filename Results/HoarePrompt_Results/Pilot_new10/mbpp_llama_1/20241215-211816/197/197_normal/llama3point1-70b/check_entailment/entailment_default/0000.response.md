Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code defines a function `func_1(tup, lst)` that takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input, counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` in `tup`, and returns the sum of these counts. 

Upon examining the code, we can see that it uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element in `lst`. For each element, it counts the number of occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method of tuples and sums up these counts.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that it handles empty inputs by returning `0`. This is indeed the case, as when `lst` is empty, the generator expression inside `sum` will produce an empty sequence, and `sum` will return `0` by default.

To verify the correctness of the code for every potential case, let's consider a few examples:

1. **Empty list**: If `lst` is an empty list, the function should return `0`, which it does, as the `sum` function will be operating on an empty sequence.
2. **Empty tuple**: If `tup` is an empty tuple, the `count` method will correctly return `0` for each element in `lst`, and the function will return `0`.
3. **List with unique elements**: If `lst` contains unique elements that are also present in `tup`, the function will correctly count the occurrences of each element and return their sum.
4. **List with duplicate elements**: If `lst` contains duplicate elements, the function will still work correctly because it counts the occurrences of each element in `lst` separately and sums them up.

In all these cases, the code seems to behave as expected according to the problem description. Since we couldn't find any scenario where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct for every potential case.
