Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. This function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then checks if the given month number is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The program correctly handles all potential cases. It correctly identifies the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) and returns `True` for these months. For the months with fewer than 31 days (February, April, June, September, and November), it correctly returns `False`.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program, as they cover various cases and the function behaves as expected in all of them.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It correctly handles all potential cases and does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle.
