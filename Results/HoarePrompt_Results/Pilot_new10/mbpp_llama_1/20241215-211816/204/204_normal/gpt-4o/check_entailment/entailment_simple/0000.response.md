Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. It checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. 

Here's why it's correct:

- The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and checks if it exists in the set `months_with_31_days`.
- The set `months_with_31_days` correctly includes all the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).
- The function returns `True` if the month is in the set, indicating that the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise, indicating that the month does not have 31 days.
- The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function for different month numbers.

The program correctly handles all possible month numbers (1 to 12) and returns the expected result as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
