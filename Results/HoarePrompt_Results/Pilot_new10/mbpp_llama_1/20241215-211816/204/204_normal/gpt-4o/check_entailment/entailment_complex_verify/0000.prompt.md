You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then returns `True` if the input month is in the set and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles all 12 months of the year. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are all included in the set. The function also correctly returns `False` for the months with fewer than 31 days, which are February (2), April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Since the function correctly handles all possible inputs and the unit tests pass, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if the month has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and False otherwise (February, April, June, September, November)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer month between 1 and 12 and returns True if the month has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and False otherwise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
