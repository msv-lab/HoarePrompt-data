The given code defines a set `months_with_31_days` containing the months with 31 days. The initial state specifies that `month` is an integer between 1 and 12.

The defined set `months_with_31_days` is equal to {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}. The state of `month` is not changed by the code. 

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12, `months_with_31_days` is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}**
