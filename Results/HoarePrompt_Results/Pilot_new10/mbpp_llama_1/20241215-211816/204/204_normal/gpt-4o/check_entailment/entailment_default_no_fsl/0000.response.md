Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

The program correctly returns `True` if the input month is in the set `months_with_31_days` and `False` otherwise. The provided unit tests and output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

For every potential case, the program checks if the input month is in the set of months with 31 days and returns the correct result. There are no edge cases that the program does not handle correctly. The function correctly handles input months from 1 to 12 and returns the expected output.

The output hints provide examples of the function's behavior, which match the expected output. The problem description is also consistent with the function's implementation, and there are no examples that suggest the program does not work correctly. Therefore, the code is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
