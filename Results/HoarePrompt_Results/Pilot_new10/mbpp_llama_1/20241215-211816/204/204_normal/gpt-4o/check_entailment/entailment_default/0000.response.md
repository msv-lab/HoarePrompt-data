Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a set `months_with_31_days` that contains the month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) which correspond to the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). The function `func_1` checks if the given month is in this set and returns True if it is, and False otherwise. 

The provided unit tests also confirm this, for example, `func_1(5)` returns True because May has 31 days, and `func_1(2)` returns False because February has fewer than 31 days. 

The code correctly handles all possible month inputs from 1 to 12, as confirmed by the unit tests and the fact that the `months_with_31_days` set includes all the months with 31 days. 

There are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle. The function does not have any error checking code for inputs outside the range 1 to 12, but based on the provided unit tests and the output hints, it seems that the function is expected to work only for inputs between 1 and 12. If error checking for invalid inputs is required, the function would need to be modified. However, based on the given problem description, output hints, and unit tests, the function appears to be correct.
