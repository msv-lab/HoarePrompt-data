Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, representing a month of the year.
2. The list `months_31_days` contains the month numbers that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).
3. The function uses the `in` operator to check if the input month `n` is present in the `months_31_days` list.
4. If `n` is found in the list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program handles all possible cases:

- For months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), the function correctly returns `True`.
- For months with fewer than 31 days (2, 4, 6, 9, 11), the function correctly returns `False`.

Since the program accurately implements the logic to check whether a given month has 31 days or not, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
