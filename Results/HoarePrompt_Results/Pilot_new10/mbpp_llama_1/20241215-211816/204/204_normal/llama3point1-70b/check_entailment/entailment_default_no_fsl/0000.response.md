Correctness: **True**

The code correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1(n)` checks if the month number `n` is in the list `months_31_days`, which includes the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). If `n` is in the list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The output hints provided also agree with the code's functionality, listing the months with 31 days and those without. The code handles all 12 months of the year and returns the correct result for each one.

Additionally, the code does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It correctly handles month numbers from 1 to 12 and returns the expected result for each. For example, `func_1(1)` returns `True` (January has 31 days), `func_1(2)` returns `False` (February does not have 31 days), and so on.

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
