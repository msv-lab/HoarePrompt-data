Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the function as per the problem description. It checks whether a given month number has 31 days or not. The function `func_1(n)` accepts an integer `n` representing a month of the year and returns `True` if the month has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December), and `False` otherwise (February, April, June, September, and November).

The code uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. It then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list using the `in` operator. If `n` is in the list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The output hints agree with the code, confirming that the function behaves as expected. The function correctly handles all potential cases, including months with 31 days and those without. There are no edge cases or examples where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description, and the correctness is **True**.
