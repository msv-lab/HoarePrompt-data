The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing a month of the year, where `1 <= n <= 12`. It checks if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days by verifying if `n` is in the list `months_31_days`, which contains the months with 31 days. 

Upon examining the code, it appears that the function does exactly what the annotations describe. The function will return `True` for the months of January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, and `False` for the months of February, April, June, September, and November.

The function handles all potential cases, as it checks for the presence of `n` in the list `months_31_days`. If `n` is not in the list, it will return `False`. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing a month of the year and returns `True` if the month has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December), and `False` otherwise (February, April, June, September, and November). **
