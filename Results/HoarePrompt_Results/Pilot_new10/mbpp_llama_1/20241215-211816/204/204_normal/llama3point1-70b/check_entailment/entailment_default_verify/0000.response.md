Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The list `months_31_days` includes all the months that have 31 days in a standard Gregorian calendar, and the function handles all possible valid inputs correctly.

The output hints provide examples of the cases that the code handles correctly, which aligns with the problem description. The function returns `True` for months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) and `False` otherwise (February, April, June, September, and November).

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a positive integer representing a month of the year), the function does not need to handle invalid inputs, and the original assessment correctly states that it handles all possible inputs correctly.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
