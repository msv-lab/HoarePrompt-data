You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It achieves this by defining a list `months_31_days` that includes the month numbers (1-indexed) corresponding to January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which are the months with 31 days in the Gregorian calendar. The function then returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in this list and `False` otherwise.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description:
- For month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, the function correctly returns `True` since these months have 31 days.
- For month numbers 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, the function correctly returns `False` since these months do not have 31 days in the standard Gregorian calendar.
- For any other integer inputs outside the range of 1 to 12, the function will also return `False`, which aligns with the assumption that invalid month numbers (outside 1-12) do not have 31 days, although the problem description does not explicitly address input validation for month numbers beyond the 1-12 range.

Given the straightforward and accurate implementation of the function according to the problem description, and considering the standard Gregorian calendar month lengths, the code is correct for all potential cases related to the months of the year.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 12, representing a month of the year.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns True if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days, False otherwise


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
