The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists, with the constraint that `list1` is not empty. The function returns a list that is the result of concatenating all elements in `list1` except the last one with all elements in `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists, with `list1` being non-empty, and returns a list that concatenates all elements in `list1` except the last one with all elements in `list2`.**
