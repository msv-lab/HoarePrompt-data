Postcondition: ***list1 and list2 are lists. Since the condition in the if statement checks if list1 is truthy (which is always the case given the precondition that list1 is not empty), the else part will never be executed. Therefore, list1 will have its last element replaced by the elements of list2, and list2 retains its status as a list.***
