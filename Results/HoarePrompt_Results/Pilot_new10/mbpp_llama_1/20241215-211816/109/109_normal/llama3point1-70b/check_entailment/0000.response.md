Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, when the first list is empty, the program should replace it with the second list, but instead, it creates a new local variable `list1` and assigns `list2` to it, without modifying the original list. However, since it returns `list1`, which is now a reference to the local variable, it seems to work correctly in some cases. 

But consider the following scenario: 

If the original function is called with two lists, and the first list is empty, then the function should return the second list. But when you pass these lists to this function by reference, the original lists outside the function will not be modified as expected. 

Here is an example that demonstrates this issue:
```python
list1 = []
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
print(func_1(list1, list2)) # prints [1, 2, 3]
print(list1) # still prints [], not [1, 2, 3]
```

In this case, `func_1` returns `[1, 2, 3]`, but the original `list1` is still an empty list. This shows that the function does not correctly replace the original list when it is empty. 

However, if the function is modified to correctly handle this case, for example by using a global variable or by returning the result of the list modification, then it would work correctly in all cases. 

But as the program currently stands, because it does not correctly modify the original list when it is empty, its correctness is **False**.
