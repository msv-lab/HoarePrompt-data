The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, where both are lists. The code checks if `list1` is truthy (which it always is given the precondition that `list1` is not empty), and if so, it replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. The else part of the if-else statement, which assigns `list2` to `list1` when `list1` is empty, will never be executed due to the precondition on `list1`. 

However, the code does not handle the case where `list1` is empty, as the function's behavior in this scenario is undefined due to the precondition stating `list1` is not empty. Nonetheless, examining the code, if `list1` were somehow empty, the function would still attempt to execute without changing `list1`, because the else part would not be executed due to the reassignment of `list1` being local to the function scope and thus not affecting the original list outside the function. 

The function returns `list1`, which, according to the code's execution, will contain all its original elements except the last one, replaced by all elements of `list2` if `list1` is not empty.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns `list1` with its last element replaced by all elements of `list2` if `list1` is not empty; if `list1` is empty, it does not modify `list1` and returns the original `list1` because the modification inside the function does not affect the original list due to scope limitations. **
