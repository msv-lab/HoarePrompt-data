The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, where both are lists and `list1` is not empty. After executing the function body, the function returns `list1` modified to exclude its last original element, and this exclusion is followed by the inclusion of all elements from `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return `list1` with its last element replaced by all elements of `list2`.
