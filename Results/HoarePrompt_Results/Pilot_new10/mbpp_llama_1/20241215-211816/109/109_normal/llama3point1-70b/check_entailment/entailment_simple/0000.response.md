Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. 

Here's why it works:

1. The function checks if `list1` is not empty using the condition `if list1`. Since `list1` is guaranteed to be not empty according to the problem description, this condition will always be true.

2. If `list1` is not empty, the line `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. The syntax `list1[-1:]` refers to a slice that includes only the last element of `list1`. By assigning `list2` to this slice, we effectively replace the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`.

3. The function then returns `list1`, which now contains all its original elements except the last one, replaced by all elements of `list2`.

The `else` block is not necessary in this case because the problem description guarantees that `list1` is not empty. However, it does handle the case where `list1` is empty, by assigning `list2` to `list1`. But since this case is not supposed to occur according to the problem description, the correctness of the program is not affected by this `else` block.

The program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description.
