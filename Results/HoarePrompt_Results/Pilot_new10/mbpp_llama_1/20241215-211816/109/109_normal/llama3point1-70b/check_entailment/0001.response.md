Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if the first list `list1` is not empty, and if so, it replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of the second list `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it assigns `list2` to `list1`. This behavior is consistent with the problem description.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:

* If `list1` is not empty and `list2` is not empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with the elements of `list2`. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])` returns `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.
* If `list1` is empty, `list1` is assigned the value of `list2`. For example, `func_1([], [4, 5])` returns `[4, 5]`.
* If `list2` is empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with an empty list. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3], [])` returns `[1, 2, []]`.

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
