To calculate the postcondition, we first need to understand the given precondition and the if condition. The precondition states that `list1` and `list2` are lists, and `list1` is not empty. The if condition is `if (list1):`, which in most programming languages, especially Python, would evaluate to `True` if `list1` is not empty and `False` if `list1` is empty. However, since we are looking at the case where the program does not enter the if block and instead enters the else block, we need to consider the negation of the if condition.

Given the if condition `if (list1):`, its negation would imply that `list1` is empty, because that's the only condition under which the if statement would evaluate to `False` and thus not be executed, leading to the execution of the else block.

The precondition already states that `list1` is not empty, but since we are calculating the postcondition for the scenario where the if condition is false (i.e., `list1` is empty), we must adjust our understanding accordingly. However, it's crucial to note that in this specific task, the condition `if (list1):` being false directly contradicts the precondition that `list1` is not empty. This means our postcondition must reflect the state where the initial assumption about `list1` not being empty is actually violated for the program to enter the else block.

Postcondition: **list1 is an empty list, and list2 is a list.**
