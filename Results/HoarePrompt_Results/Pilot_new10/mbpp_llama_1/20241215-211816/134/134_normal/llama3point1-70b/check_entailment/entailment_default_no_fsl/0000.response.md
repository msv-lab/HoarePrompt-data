Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of binomial coefficients "n choose i" for all even indices `i` from 0 to `n`. 

Here's why the code works:

- It iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.
- For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is even by using the condition `if i % 2 == 0`.
- If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient "n choose i" using the `math.comb(n, i)` function and adds it to the sum.
- The function finally returns the sum of binomial coefficients for all even indices.

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, stating that the function returns the sum of binomial coefficients for all even indices from 0 to `n`. 

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
