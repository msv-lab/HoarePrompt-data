According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. Since `i` is now odd, there is no change in `sum`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`, so `n` must be at least 1 for `i` to be 1 and still be less than `n + 1`, but since `n` is already a positive integer, it is already at least 1, thus `n` can be any positive integer and `i` being 1 will still satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `sum` is 1**
