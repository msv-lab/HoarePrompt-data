To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the variables `n`, `sum`, and `i`.

Given that `i` is currently 0 and `i` is even (which is true for `i = 0` since `0 % 2 == 0`), and `n` is a positive integer, we can evaluate the expression `math.comb(n, i)`.

`math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order. When `i = 0`, this is equivalent to choosing no items from `n` items, which can only be done in one way (by choosing no items at all). Therefore, `math.comb(n, 0) = 1` for any positive integer `n`.

The code then adds this result to `sum`, so `sum += math.comb(n, 0)` becomes `sum += 1`.

Since `sum` was initially 0, after executing this code, `sum` will be 1.

The states of the variables `n` and `i` are not changed by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, and `i` is 0 (and still even).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, and `i` is 0**
