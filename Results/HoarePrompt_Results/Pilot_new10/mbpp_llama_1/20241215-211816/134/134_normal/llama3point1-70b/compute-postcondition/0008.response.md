To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is 1.
- The if condition `i % 2 == 0` is not met (since `i` is 1, which is not even), thus `sum` remains 1.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n + 1):`. This means the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

Since `i` is now 2, which is even, the condition `i % 2 == 0` will be met. However, the problem statement doesn't specify what happens when this condition is met, so we can't directly infer the impact on `sum`. But we can say that since `i` is now even, any conditional logic based on `i % 2 == 0` would be triggered.

For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again (because the range goes up to `n` inclusive, due to `n + 1` in the `range` function).

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `sum` remains to be determined based on the loop body logic**.
