According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, the loop can execute. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), so `i` will initially be 0. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
