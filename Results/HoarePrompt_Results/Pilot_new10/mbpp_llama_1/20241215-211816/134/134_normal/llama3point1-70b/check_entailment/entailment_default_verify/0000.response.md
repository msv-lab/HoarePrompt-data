The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` accurately calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The code uses the `math.comb(n, i)` function to calculate the binomial coefficient and iterates over all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop, adding the binomial coefficient to the sum if the index `i` is even.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of binomial coefficients "n choose i" for all even `i` from 0 to `n`, which aligns with the problem description.

Upon reviewing the code and the provided explanations, it appears that the code correctly implements the problem description. The function works for any positive integer `n` and correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients. There are no obvious edge cases that the code does not handle, assuming valid input is always provided.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
