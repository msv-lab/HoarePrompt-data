#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is a positive integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer n and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1) without validating whether n is a positive integer, which may lead to unexpected results for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.
