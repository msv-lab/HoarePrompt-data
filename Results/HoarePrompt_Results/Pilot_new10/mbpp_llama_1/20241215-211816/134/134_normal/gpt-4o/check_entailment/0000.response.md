Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is a simple function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

This function works based on the mathematical property that the sum of the binomial coefficients of even indices for the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This property is utilized in the function to directly calculate the sum without actually calculating the individual binomial coefficients.

The unit tests provided, such as `func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, and `func_1(2) == 2`, all pass, confirming that the function works correctly for these cases.

Moreover, this property applies to all positive integers `n`, and there is no apparent edge case that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that the function is correct for all potential inputs. 

It's worth noting that the function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer. However, as the problem description specifies that `n` is a positive integer, it can be assumed that the function will only be used with valid inputs. If the function were to be used with other types of inputs, additional error checking would be necessary. But based on the given problem description, the function appears to be correct.
