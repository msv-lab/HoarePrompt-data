Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The problem description requires finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. The provided code uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of n is equal to 2^(n-1). 

The given unit tests `assert func_1(4) == 8`, `assert func_1(6) == 32`, and `assert func_1(2) == 2` confirm that the function works correctly for these specific cases.

Moreover, this property holds true for all positive integers n. The code directly calculates 2 raised to the power of (n - 1) without iterating through individual binomial coefficients, making it efficient.

However, it is worth noting that the function does not validate whether the input n is a positive integer. But since the problem description explicitly states that n is a positive integer, it is assumed that the input will always be valid.

In conclusion, the code correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any given positive integer n, making the correctness True.
