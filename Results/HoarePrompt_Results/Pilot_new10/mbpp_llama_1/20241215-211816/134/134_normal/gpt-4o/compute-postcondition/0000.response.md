The program uses the variable `n` which is a positive integer. It returns the result of `2 ** (n - 1)`, where `**` denotes exponentiation. Given that `n` is a positive integer, `n - 1` will be a non-negative integer because when `n` is 1 (the smallest positive integer), `n - 1` equals 0.

Output State: **The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is a positive integer**
