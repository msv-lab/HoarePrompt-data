Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` is set to `lst`. Otherwise, `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
