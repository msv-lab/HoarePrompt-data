The value of `max_list` is updated to be the same as `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`, so `max_list` becomes equal to the first list in `list_of_lists`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least one list, `max_len` is the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the first list in `list_of_lists`, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`.**
