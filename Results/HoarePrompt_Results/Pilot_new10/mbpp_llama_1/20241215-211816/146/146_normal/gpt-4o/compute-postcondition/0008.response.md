The code updates `max_len` to be the length of `lst`. Since `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, its length is used to update `max_len`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is not updated by this code**
