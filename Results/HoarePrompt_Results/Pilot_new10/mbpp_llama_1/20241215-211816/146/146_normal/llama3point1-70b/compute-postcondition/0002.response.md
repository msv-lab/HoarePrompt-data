The `max_len` is equal to the maximum length of sublists in `list_of_lists`. The `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where each sublist has a length of `max_len`. 

When the program returns `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]`, it returns the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist that has this maximum length.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists in 'list_of_lists' and the first sublist from 'list_of_lists' that has this maximum length**
