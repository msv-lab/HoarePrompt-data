You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but the program only returns the first sublist with the maximum length.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return all sublists with the maximum length, which are `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.

The correct implementation should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected code would be:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
However, even with this correction, the function still only returns the length of the maximum sublist and the list of maximum sublists. If we want to return the list of maximum length, we can assume that the problem description wants the function to return the list of all maximum sublists. 

In case we want to return only one of the maximum sublists (for example the first one), the original function would still be incorrect because it would not handle the case when the input list is empty. In this case, the function would raise an exception when trying to access the first element of an empty list. 

The correct implementation would handle this case and return an empty list or a specific value to indicate that the input list is empty. 

So the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when there are multiple sublists with the maximum length and it does not handle the case when the input list is empty.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist it encounters with this maximum length. If the input list is empty, the function will throw an error.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
