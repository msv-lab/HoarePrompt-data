Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but the code only returns the first sublist it encounters with the maximum length. 

For example, if we have a list of lists `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the function should return the maximum length of sublists (which is 3) and the list of all sublists with this maximum length (which is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`). However, the function will only return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, which is not the expected output.

Another case where the function does not work correctly is when the input list is empty. As mentioned in the output hints, the function will throw an error in this case, instead of returning a meaningful result. 

The function should be modified to return all sublists with the maximum length, and to handle the case of an empty input list.
