Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, whereas the problem description asks for the "list of maximum length" in a list of lists, which implies that all sublists with the maximum length should be returned.

In the given program, the list comprehension `[sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]` correctly generates all sublists with the maximum length, but the function returns only the first element of this list (`max_sublists[0]`) instead of the entire list.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, whereas the correct output should be all sublists with the maximum length, which are `[[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8]]`.

To fix this, the function should return `max_sublists` instead of `max_sublists[0]`. The corrected function would be:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists
```
