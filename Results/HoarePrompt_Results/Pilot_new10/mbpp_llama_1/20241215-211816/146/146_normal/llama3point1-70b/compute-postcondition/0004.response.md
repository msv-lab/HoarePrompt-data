The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. The function calculates the maximum length of sublists in `list_of_lists` and identifies the sublists with this maximum length. However, the function only returns the first sublist it encounters with this maximum length, not all sublists with this maximum length. 

If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will throw a `ValueError` because it tries to find the maximum length of sublists using the `max` function with an empty sequence. If `list_of_lists` contains only one sublist, the function will return a tuple containing the length of this sublist and the sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` contains multiple sublists with different lengths, the function will return the maximum length and the first sublist with this maximum length.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist it encounters with this maximum length. If the input list is empty, the function will throw an error. **
