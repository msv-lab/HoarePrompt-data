Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but the program only returns the first sublist with the maximum length.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return all sublists with the maximum length, which are `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.

The correct implementation should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected code would be:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
However, even with this correction, the function still only returns the length of the maximum sublist and the list of maximum sublists. If we want to return the list of maximum length, we can assume that the problem description wants the function to return the list of all maximum sublists. 

In case we want to return only one of the maximum sublists (for example the first one), the original function would still be incorrect because it would not handle the case when the input list is empty. In this case, the function would raise an exception when trying to access the first element of an empty list. 

The correct implementation would handle this case and return an empty list or a specific value to indicate that the input list is empty. 

So the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when there are multiple sublists with the maximum length and it does not handle the case when the input list is empty.
