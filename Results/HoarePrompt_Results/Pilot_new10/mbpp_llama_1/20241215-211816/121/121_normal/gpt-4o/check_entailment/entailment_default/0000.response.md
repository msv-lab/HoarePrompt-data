Correctness: **False**.

The given code is supposed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the code does not actually check if the numbers generated by the sequence are prime numbers. It simply returns the nth term of the sequence  `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`. 

The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence is a sequence of prime numbers of the form `2 * S(n-1) + S(n-2)`, where `S(n)` is a sequence of numbers. The code does generate numbers from this sequence, but it does not verify if these numbers are prime. The provided unit tests also do not guarantee primality.

For example, plugging in `n = 6` results in `S6 = 2 * S5 + S4 = 2 * 41 + 17 = 99`, which is not a prime number.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, as it does not verify if the numbers generated are indeed prime numbers.
