According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already a positive integer greater than 1, the loop can execute. The loop starts from `i = 2`, so before the loop starts, `i` should be less than 2 to ensure the loop can execute. 

Given that `n` is greater than 1, `S0` is 1, and `S1` is 1, for the loop to execute, `i` must be 2 at the start of the loop. However, since we are considering the state before the loop starts, `i` should be 1 or less to ensure that when the loop starts, it will be 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is less than 2**
