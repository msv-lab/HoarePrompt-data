Correctness: **False**

The given program is trying to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number sequence is defined as the sequence of prime numbers of the form 4n^2 - 2n + 1, but the given program does not generate this sequence.

The given program appears to be generating a sequence based on the recursive formula S_next = 2 * S1 + S0, which does not match the definition of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The provided unit tests also do not cover the cases where n is greater than 5 or where the result is not a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate prime numbers of the form 4n^2 - 2n + 1 and return the nth prime number in the sequence. The given program does not perform this task and therefore is not correct.

Here's an example case where the program does not work correctly:

If we call `func_1(1)`, the program returns `1`, but `1` is not considered a prime number. The correct first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number is `7` (which is `4(1)^2 - 2(1) + 1`), so the function should return `7` when `n` is `1`. However, the function does not handle this case correctly. 

A correct implementation of the function would involve checking if a number is prime and generating the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers, which the given program does not do.
