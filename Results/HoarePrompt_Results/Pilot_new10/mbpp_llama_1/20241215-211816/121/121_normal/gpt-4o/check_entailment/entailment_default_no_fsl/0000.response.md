Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are defined as a sequence where each term is calculated using a specific formula, but the provided code does not seem to be directly related to this sequence.

The code appears to calculate a sequence where each term is `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`, which does not match the definition of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are actually a sequence of prime numbers where each term is a prime number of the form `2^(2^n) + 1`.

A correct implementation of the function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number would involve checking if numbers of the form `2^(2^n) + 1` are prime, not calculating a sequence based on the provided formula.

For example, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are `2^(2^0) + 1 = 3`, `2^(2^1) + 1 = 5`, `2^(2^2) + 1 = 17`, `2^(2^3) + 1 = 257`. The provided code does not correctly calculate these values.
