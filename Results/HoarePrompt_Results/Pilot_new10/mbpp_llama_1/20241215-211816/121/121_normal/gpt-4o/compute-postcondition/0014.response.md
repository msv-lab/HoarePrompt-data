To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.


Given:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `S0` is the second to last term in the sequence.
- `S1` is the last term in the sequence.
- Each term in the sequence is calculated as `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`.
- `i` is `n + 1`, but `i` is not used in the calculation of `S1` based on the provided initial state and code.


Since the exact values of `S0` and `S1` are not provided, we can only describe their relationship based on the sequence definition. The last term `S1` is calculated using the formula `2 * S0 + S_before_S0`, where `S_before_S0` would be the term before `S0` in the sequence.


However, without the initial terms of the sequence or a clearer definition of how `S0` and `S1` relate to `n`, we can only say that `S1` is the result of the sequence's calculation up to its last term.


Given the return statement `return S1`, we're returning the last term of the sequence as defined by the initial state.


Output State: **The program returns S1, which is the last term in the sequence calculated as per the given formula, where each term depends on the two preceding terms.**
