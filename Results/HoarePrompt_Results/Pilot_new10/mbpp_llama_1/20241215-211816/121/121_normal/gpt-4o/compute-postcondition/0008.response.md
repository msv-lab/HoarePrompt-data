To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3.

The given code is: `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`.

Now, substituting the values of `S1` and `S0` into the code, we get: `S_next = 2 * 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`.

So, `S_next` becomes 7.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `S0`, `S1`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
