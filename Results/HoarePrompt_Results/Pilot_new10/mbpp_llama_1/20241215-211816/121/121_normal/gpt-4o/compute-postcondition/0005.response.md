The code assigns a new value to `S_next` based on the values of `S1` and `S0`. Given that `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 1, `S_next` is calculated as 2 * `S1` + `S0` = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, and `i` is still less than 2. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is less than 2, `S_next` is 3**
