The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` remains a positive integer and not equal to 1. The value of `num` remains 7, which has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. The function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument still returns `True`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, the current value of `num` is 7, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns `True`, and `num` has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6**
