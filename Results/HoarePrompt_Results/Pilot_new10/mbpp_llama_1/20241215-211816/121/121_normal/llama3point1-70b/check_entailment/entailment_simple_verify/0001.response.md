The original assessment is None, which means a judgment about the correctness of the program was not provided.

After analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, we can see that the program is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. A Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is a prime number of the form 6k ± 1, where k is a positive integer.

The code consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The annotated version provides additional information about the state of the program at various points.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program seems to be correct. It correctly checks for primality and then checks if the prime number is of the form 6k ± 1.

The original assessment being None means we have to determine the correctness from scratch. The code appears to handle the cases correctly as per the problem description, and the annotations further support this by describing the state of the program at different points.

Therefore, after analyzing the code and its annotations, it seems the program is correct based on the given problem description.

Final: **True**
