To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. Since the loop body is omitted, we can't directly see what conditions might cause the loop to exit. However, based on the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer the following:

1. `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1.
2. `num` is 9.
3. The function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value.
4. If `func_1(num)` is true and `num` % 6 is in [1, 5] and `count` equals `n`, then the program returns `num` which is 9.
5. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged with `count` being 1 and not equal to `n` unless `n` is 2, in which case `count` equals `n`.

Given that this is a `while True` loop, the loop will always execute again unless there's a `break` statement inside the loop that we're not seeing. Since we're tasked with modifying the program state so that the next iteration can proceed, and given the conditions provided don't directly impact the loop's continuation (as they seem to relate to the loop's body and potential exit conditions rather than the loop's condition itself, which is always true), we don't need to adjust `n`, `num`, or the function `func_1`'s behavior to ensure the loop can execute again.

The state after the previous iteration is such that unless specific conditions are met (which apparently were not, since we're considering the next iteration), the variables' states remain largely unchanged with `count` being 1 (except when `n` is 2). Since `n` is not equal to 1 and is a positive integer, and we're not given any information that would suggest changing `n` or `num` to ensure the loop continues (as the loop's continuation is guaranteed by `while True`), we don't need to adjust these.

However, to strictly follow the task's logic and ensure clarity in our understanding:
- `n` being a positive integer not equal to 1 does not need adjustment because it doesn't directly affect the loop's ability to continue.
- `num` being 9 also doesn't need adjustment for the loop to continue since the loop's condition is `while True`.
- The return condition based on `func_1(num)`, `num` % 6, and `count` equals `n` does not affect the loop's continuation in a `while True` scenario unless a `break` is involved, which we're not shown.

Given the `while True` condition, the loop will always proceed to the next iteration regardless of the states of `n`, `num`, `func_1`, or `count`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 9, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value, `count` is 1 and not equal to `n`, unless `n` is 2, in which case `count` equals `n`**
