Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 8, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value. If `count` is equal to `n`, then the program returns `num` which is 8. Otherwise, no specific action is taken, and `count` is not equal to `n` since `n` is not equal to 2, or if `n` is 2, then `count` equals `n`.**
