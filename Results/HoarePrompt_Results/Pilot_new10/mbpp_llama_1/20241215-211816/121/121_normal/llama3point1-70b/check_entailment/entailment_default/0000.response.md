Correctness: **True**

The code seems to do what the problem description says for every potential case. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers that have a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. The code starts with the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, 7, and then increments a counter each time it encounters a prime number that has a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. 

Function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime. The function `func_2(n)` uses `func_1(n)` to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The output hints agree with the code. The code correctly handles the base case where `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, it correctly increments the counter each time it encounters a prime number that has a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6, and returns the nth such number.

Since the code starts checking from the number 7, and checks all numbers sequentially, it will eventually find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number for any positive integer n. The code does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, but the problem description does not specify what should happen in these cases, so this is not considered an error. 

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
