The code increments `num` by 1. Initially, `num` is 8, so after the increment, `num` becomes 9. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 9, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value, if `func_1(num)` is true and `num` % 6 is in [1, 5] and `count` equals `n`, then the program returns `num` which is 9, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged with `count` being 1 and not equal to `n` unless `n` is 2, in which case `count` equals `n`.**
