Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the functionality to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. A Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. 

Function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. This is an optimized approach to check for primality.

Function `func_2(n)` uses `func_1(n)` to check if a number is prime and also checks if the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. It starts from 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments the count whenever it encounters a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. Once the count reaches `n`, it returns the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. It handles the base case correctly (when `n` is 1, it returns 7) and correctly increments the count for subsequent Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. 

The program also seems to be efficient as it checks for primality up to the square root of the number and only checks for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of the number.

In conclusion, the program appears to be correct as it accurately implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number and handles all potential cases correctly.
