Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are prime numbers that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. 

Here's why the code seems correct:

1. Function `func_1(n)` checks whether a given number is prime. It correctly handles edge cases like numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

2. Function `func_2(n)` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts with the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is 7. It then checks each subsequent number to see if it is prime (using `func_1(n)`) and if it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.

3. The program correctly handles the case when `n` equals 1, returning the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is 7.

The code seems to handle all potential cases correctly, including edge cases like `n` equals 1 and large values of `n`. Without any specific counterexample, it is reasonable to conclude that the code is correct. 

However, it's worth noting that this code may not be efficient for very large values of `n` because it checks every number to see if it is prime. A more efficient solution might involve using a prime number sieve to generate prime numbers. Nonetheless, in terms of correctness, the provided program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description.
