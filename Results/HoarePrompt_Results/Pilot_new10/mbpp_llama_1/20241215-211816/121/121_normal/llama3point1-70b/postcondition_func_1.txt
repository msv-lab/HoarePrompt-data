The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is 7 if `n` is 1, and for `n` greater than 1, it returns the `n`th number that is a prime and has a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6, with undefined behavior for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.
