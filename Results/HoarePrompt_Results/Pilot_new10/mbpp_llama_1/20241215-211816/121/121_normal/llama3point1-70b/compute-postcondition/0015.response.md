The code increments the value of `num` by 1. The initial value of `num` is 7. After the increment operation, `num` becomes 8.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. `n` is still a positive integer and not equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to `count`. 

The function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument initially returns `True` when `num` is 7, but its return value when `num` is 8 is unknown.

The value of `count` initially depends on the remainder when `num` is divided by 6. When `num` is 7, it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, so `count` is 2.

Now, when `num` becomes 8, it has a remainder of 2 when divided by 6, so `count` would be 1 according to the given conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 8, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value, `count` is 1, and `count` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 8, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value, `count` is 1, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
