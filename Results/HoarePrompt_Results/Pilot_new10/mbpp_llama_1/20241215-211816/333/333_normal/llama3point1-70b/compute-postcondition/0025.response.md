To determine the output state, let's consider the given information and the code snippet. 

The code snippet is `return not stack`. This means the program will return the opposite of the boolean value indicating whether the `stack` is empty or not. 

Given that `stack` contains unmatched opening brackets if any, the boolean value of `stack` (when converted to a boolean) will be `True` if it's not empty (i.e., there are unmatched opening brackets) and `False` if it is empty (i.e., all brackets are matched).

The `not` operator inverts this boolean value:
- If `stack` is empty (`False`), `not stack` will be `True`.
- If `stack` is not empty (`True`), `not stack` will be `False`.

So, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack of unmatched opening brackets is empty.

Output State: **The program returns True if there are no unmatched opening brackets in 'stack', otherwise it returns False**
