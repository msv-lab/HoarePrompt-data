Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string containing characters, `char` is the first character in `expression`, `stack` is a list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'} and `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary. If `char` is one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary, the stack is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, or after popping the last element from the stack, the popped opening bracket matches the current closing bracket `char`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle other cases.***
