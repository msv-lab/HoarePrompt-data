The code defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. The initial state is that `expression` is a string containing characters that are typically used in expressions, such as parentheses, brackets, and braces, and `stack` is an empty list.

The states of the variables `expression` and `stack` are not affected by this code. The code only defines a new variable `brackets` which is a dictionary containing the mapping of opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing characters that are typically used in expressions, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
