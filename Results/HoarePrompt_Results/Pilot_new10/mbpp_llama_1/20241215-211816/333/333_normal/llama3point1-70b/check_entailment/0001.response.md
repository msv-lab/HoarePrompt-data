Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a solution to the problem of checking if a given expression is balanced or not. The function `func_1` uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It initializes an empty stack `stack` to store the opening brackets.
2. It defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.
3. It iterates over each character in the input `expression`.
4. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it's a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it pushes the character onto the stack.
5. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a value in the `brackets` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match with the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
6. After iterating over the entire expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not, that means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Balanced expressions: `func_1("({[]})")` returns `True`
* Unbalanced expressions: `func_1("({[})")` returns `False`
* Empty expressions: `func_1("")` returns `True`
* Expressions with only opening brackets: `func_1("({[")` returns `False`
* Expressions with only closing brackets: `func_1(")}]")` returns `False`

I couldn't find any case where the program doesn't work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
