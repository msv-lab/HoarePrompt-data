Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to check if a given expression is balanced, meaning all brackets are properly matched and nested. The function `func_1` uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the expression. It iterates through each character in the input string. If it encounters an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, or `'['`), it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, or `']'`), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not contain the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the expression is not balanced. After processing all characters, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets were properly closed, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating there are unmatched opening brackets.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem, including:

1. **Properly Nested Brackets**: The function correctly identifies expressions with properly nested brackets as balanced.
2. **Mismatched Brackets**: It correctly identifies expressions where a closing bracket does not match the opening bracket it is supposed to close.
3. **Unmatched Opening Brackets**: It correctly identifies expressions where there are opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets.
4. **Empty String**: An empty string is considered balanced because there are no brackets to match, and the function will return `True` for an empty string input.
5. **Only Closing Brackets**: If the input string contains only closing brackets, the function will correctly return `False` because there are no corresponding opening brackets.

The output hints provided align with the functionality of the code, covering scenarios where closing brackets do not match their corresponding opening brackets or where there are unmatched opening brackets at the end of the string. The code correctly handles these and all other potential cases, ensuring that it accurately implements the described functionality.
