The code `stack.append(char)` adds the `char` to the end of the `stack` list. 

The initial state is: `expression` is a string containing at least one more character, `char` is the third character in `expression`, `stack` is a list, and `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}}.

After executing the code, the state of `expression`, `brackets` and `char` does not change. However, `stack` now includes `char` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing at least one more character, `char` is the third character in `expression`, `stack` is a list containing its original elements and `char` at the end, and `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}}.
