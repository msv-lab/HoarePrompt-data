The given code returns a boolean value, specifically False, indicating that the parentheses, brackets, or braces in the string `expr` do not match properly. This is because the current character `char` is a closing bracket and either the stack is empty or its top element does not match the corresponding opening bracket of `char` as defined in `matching_pairs`. 

Output State: **The program returns False, indicating that the string `expr` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces has mismatched or unbalanced brackets.**
