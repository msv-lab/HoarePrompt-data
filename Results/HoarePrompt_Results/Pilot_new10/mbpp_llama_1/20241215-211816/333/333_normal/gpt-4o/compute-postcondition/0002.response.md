According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `expr`. If `expr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list, and `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets. To ensure the loop can execute, `expr` must not be empty, `char` should be the first character in the string, and `stack` remains empty at the start of the loop. `matching_pairs` remains unchanged as it only provides the matching pairs and does not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', `char` is the first character in `expr`**
