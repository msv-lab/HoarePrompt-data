The code `stack.append(char)` appends the `char` to the end of the `stack` list. The `char` is the next character in `expr`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least one more character, `stack` is a list that now contains all the previous characters and the new `char`, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', and `char` is the next character in `expr`.
