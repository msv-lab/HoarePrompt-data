Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code seems to be correct. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the expression. The `matching_pairs` dictionary maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. 

For each character in the expression, the code checks if it's an opening bracket (a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary) and pushes it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket (a key in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns False, indicating an unbalanced expression. 

After processing all characters in the expression, the code checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means every opening bracket was correctly matched with a closing bracket, and the function returns True, indicating a balanced expression. If the stack is not empty, that means there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns False.

The provided unit tests also validate the function's correctness for different cases, including balanced and unbalanced expressions. 

The output hints agree with the code's behavior, and based on the provided information, the code should correctly identify balanced and unbalanced expressions in all potential cases.
