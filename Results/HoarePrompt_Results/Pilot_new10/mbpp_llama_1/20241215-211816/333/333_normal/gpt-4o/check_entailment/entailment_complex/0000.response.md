Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the given expression `expr` is balanced, i.e., if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, and if the pairs of brackets are properly nested.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It initializes an empty stack `stack` to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far.
2. It defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
3. The program iterates over each character `char` in the input expression `expr`. If `char` is an opening bracket (i.e., a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), it pushes `char` onto the stack.
4. If `char` is a closing bracket (i.e., a key in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the expected opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.
5. After iterating over all characters in the expression, the program checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the expression is balanced, and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

The program correctly handles cases with:

* Matching brackets: `'{()}[{}]'`
* Unmatched opening brackets: `'{()}[{]'`
* Unmatched closing brackets: The program returns `False` before finishing all iterations if it encounters an unmatched closing bracket.
* No brackets: The program returns `True` if the input expression contains no brackets.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the program for various input scenarios. Therefore, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description, and its correctness is verified.
