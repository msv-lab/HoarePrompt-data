The code `stack.append(char)` adds the current character `char` to the end of the `stack` list. Given the initial state, `char` is one of the opening brackets '(', '[', or '{', and `stack` is an empty list.

After executing the code, the `stack` list will contain the opening bracket that is the current value of `char`. The other variables remain unchanged: `expr` is still a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, and `matching_pairs` is still a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is a list containing one element which is the opening bracket `char`, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', and `char` is the first character in `expr` which is one of the opening brackets '(', '[', or '{'**
