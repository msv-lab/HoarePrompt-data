The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive). 

Looking at the code, the function uses a generator expression to generate the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` and returns their sum. 

However, the code does not explicitly check if `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function will still return a value, but it may not be the expected result. 

For example, if `n` is 0, the function will return 0, because the range will be empty. If `n` is a negative integer, the function will also return 0, for the same reason. 

If `n` is not an integer, the function will still work, but the result may not be an integer, because the range function will truncate the non-integer value to an integer.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) for any integer `n`, and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 0.
