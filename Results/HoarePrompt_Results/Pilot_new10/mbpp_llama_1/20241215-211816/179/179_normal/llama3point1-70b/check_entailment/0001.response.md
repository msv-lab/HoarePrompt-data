Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's why:

- The function uses a generator expression to generate even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2` (inclusive), which corresponds to the first `n` even natural numbers (2, 4, 6,..., 2n).
- It then calculates the cube of each even number using `i ** 3`.
- The `sum` function adds up all these cubes to produce the final result.

To verify its correctness, consider the following cases:

1. **Base Case**: If `n = 1`, the function should return the cube of the first even natural number, which is 2^3 = 8. The function correctly returns `sum([2 ** 3]) = 8`.

2. **General Case**: For `n > 1`, the function calculates the sum of cubes for all even numbers up to `2n`. This matches the problem description.

Given these explanations, there's no apparent case where the function would not behave as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the function is correct for all positive integers `n`.
