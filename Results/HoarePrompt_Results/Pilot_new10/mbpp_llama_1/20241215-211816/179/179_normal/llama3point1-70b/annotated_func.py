#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2n (inclusive), where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) if `n` is a positive integer, and returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 0
