Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

* The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive).
* The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` function generates even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) when `n` is a positive integer.
* The `sum()` function then adds up these cubes to produce the desired result.
* If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the `range()` function will not generate any numbers (since `n * 2 + 1` will be less than or equal to 2), resulting in an empty generator expression. The `sum()` function will return 0 for an empty iterable, which aligns with the problem description.

The code correctly handles all potential cases, including positive integers, zero, and negative integers. Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
