Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

The function `func_1(n)` generates a list of the first n even natural numbers using a list comprehension `[(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This list includes the numbers 2, 4, 6,..., 2n, which are the first n even natural numbers.

Then, it calculates the cube sum of these numbers using a generator expression `sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`. This expression raises each number in the list to the power of 3 and sums the results.

The function returns this cube sum, which is the desired output according to the problem description.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(2) == 72` and `assert func_1(3) == 288` also validate the correctness of the function. For example, when n = 2, the first 2 even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The cube sum of these numbers is 2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72, which matches the expected output.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it is correct for every potential case.
