Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description's requirement to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
2. The expression `len(arr)` calculates the length of the input list.
3. The expression `len(set(arr))` calculates the length of a set created from the input list. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. By converting the list to a set, any duplicate elements are automatically removed.
4. The comparison `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` checks if the length of the original list is not equal to the length of the set. If this condition is true, it means that the original list contained duplicate elements, which were removed when creating the set.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`, the lengths of the list and the set would be:

* `len(arr)` = 5
* `len(set(arr))` = 4 (because the set would be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, with the duplicate `2` removed)

The comparison would evaluate to `True`, indicating that the list contains duplicate elements.

If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` with no duplicates, the lengths of the list and the set would be equal:

* `len(arr)` = 4
* `len(set(arr))` = 4

The comparison would evaluate to `False`, indicating that the list does not contain duplicate elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description's requirement to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element, making it correct.
