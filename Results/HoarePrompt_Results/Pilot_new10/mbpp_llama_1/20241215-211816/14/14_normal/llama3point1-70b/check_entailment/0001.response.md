Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate element by comparing the length of the original array with the length of a set created from the array. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate elements in the original array are automatically removed in the set.

Here's why this function works correctly:

* If the array contains duplicate elements, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original array, because duplicates are removed in the set. Therefore, `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` will return `True`, indicating that there are duplicates.
* If the array does not contain any duplicate elements, the length of the set will be equal to the length of the original array, because all elements in the array are unique. Therefore, `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` will return `False`, indicating that there are no duplicates.

This function handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty arrays: The function will correctly return `False`, because an empty array does not contain any duplicate elements.
* Arrays with a single element: The function will correctly return `False`, because an array with a single element does not contain any duplicate elements.
* Arrays with multiple unique elements: The function will correctly return `False`, because the array does not contain any duplicate elements.
* Arrays with duplicate elements: The function will correctly return `True`, because the array contains duplicate elements.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
