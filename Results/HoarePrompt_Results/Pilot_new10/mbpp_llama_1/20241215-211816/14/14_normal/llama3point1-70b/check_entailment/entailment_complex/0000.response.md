Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function that determines whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly this by comparing the length of the input list `arr` with the length of a set created from `arr`. 

In Python, a set automatically removes duplicates, so if there are any duplicate elements in `arr`, the length of `arr` will be greater than the length of the set. The function returns `True` in this case, indicating the presence of duplicates, and `False` otherwise.

This approach correctly handles arrays with and without duplicates, including empty arrays. However, as noted in the annotations, it may raise a `TypeError` if the list contains unhashable types (like lists or dictionaries), but the problem description specifically mentions arrays of integers, which are hashable. Therefore, for the given problem description, the function behaves correctly for all potential cases.
