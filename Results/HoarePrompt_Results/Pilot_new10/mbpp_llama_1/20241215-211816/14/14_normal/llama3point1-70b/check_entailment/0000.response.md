Correctness: **True**.

The provided program uses the property of sets in Python, which automatically removes duplicate elements. By comparing the length of the original array with the length of the set created from the array, the function can determine if there are any duplicate elements. 

The function `func_1(arr)` works as follows:

1. It converts the array into a set, which removes any duplicate elements.
2. It then compares the length of the original array with the length of the set.
3. If the lengths are not equal, it means that there were duplicate elements in the original array, and the function returns `True`, indicating that the array contains duplicates.
4. If the lengths are equal, it means that there were no duplicate elements in the original array, and the function returns `False`, indicating that the array does not contain duplicates.

This solution correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty arrays: The function will return `False` for an empty array, which is correct because an empty array does not contain any duplicate elements.
* Arrays with a single element: The function will return `False` for an array with a single element, which is correct because an array with a single element does not contain any duplicate elements.
* Arrays with duplicate elements: The function will return `True` for an array with duplicate elements, which is correct.
* Arrays with all unique elements: The function will return `False` for an array with all unique elements, which is correct.

Overall, the provided program is a concise and efficient solution to the problem, and it correctly handles all potential cases.
