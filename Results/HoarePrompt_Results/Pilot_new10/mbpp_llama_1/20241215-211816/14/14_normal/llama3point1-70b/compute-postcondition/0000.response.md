The given code `return len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` checks if the length of the original list `arr` is not equal to the length of a set created from `arr`. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Therefore, if there are any duplicate integers in `arr`, the length of `arr` will be greater than the length of the set created from `arr`, because the set will only contain unique integers.

Given that `arr` is a list of integers, the expression `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` will evaluate to `True` if there are any duplicate integers in `arr` and `False` otherwise.

Output State: **The program returns True if the list 'arr' contains duplicate integers, False otherwise**
