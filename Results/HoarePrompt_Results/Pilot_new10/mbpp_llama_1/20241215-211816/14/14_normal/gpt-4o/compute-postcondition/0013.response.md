To solve this problem, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given Python code affects it.

Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers.
- `seen` is a set containing at least the first and second integers in `arr`.
- `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`.
- If `num` is in `seen`, the program returns True. Otherwise, no change occurs.

Given Code:
```python
seen.add(num)
```

This code adds `num` (the third integer in `arr`) to the set `seen`.

Impact on the Program:
- The set `seen` now contains all its original elements plus `num`.
- The list `arr` and its elements, including `num`, remain unchanged because the operation is on the set `seen`, not on `arr` itself.
- The condition regarding `num` being in `seen` and potentially returning True is not directly affected by this line of code, as it's a separate conditional check not included in the given code snippet.

Output State:
- `arr` is still a list of integers with at least 3 integers.
- `seen` is a set now containing at least the first and second integers in `arr`, plus `num` (the third integer in `arr`).
- `num` is still the third integer in the list `arr`.

Therefore, considering the addition of `num` to `seen` does not inherently change the structure or elements of `arr`, nor does it directly trigger the return condition based on the provided code:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `seen` is a set containing at least the first, second, and third integers in `arr`, `num` is the third integer in `arr`.**
