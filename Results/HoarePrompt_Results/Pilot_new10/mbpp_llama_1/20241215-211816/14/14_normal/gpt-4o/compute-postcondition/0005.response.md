The code adds the value of `num` to the `seen` set. The value of `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`, and initially, `num` is not in `seen`. 

After the addition, `seen` will contain the first integer in the list `arr`. The state of `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `num` is also unchanged as it is only added to the `seen` set, not modified itself.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`, `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`.**
