To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers.
- `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr` and the second integer in `arr`.
- `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`.

The loop statement is `for num in arr:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `num` should move to the next element in the list.

Since `num` is currently the second integer in `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be the third integer in `arr`. This implies that `arr` must have at least 3 integers for the loop to continue.

Additionally, since `seen` contains the first and second integers, and we are moving to the third iteration, `seen` should also contain the third integer in `arr` if we are considering the loop body's potential effects on `seen`. However, the problem statement does not explicitly mention the loop body's effect on `seen`, so we should focus strictly on the information provided and the loop's iteration logic.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `arr` must have at least 3 integers.
- `seen` is still a set containing at least the first and second integers, but its exact content after the loop body's execution is not detailed. Given the loop statement alone, we note `seen`'s state as it was, expecting it might include more elements as iterations progress, but we don't have enough information to assert its exact state at the start of the next iteration beyond what's given.
- `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `seen` is a set containing at least the first and second integers in `arr`, `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`**
