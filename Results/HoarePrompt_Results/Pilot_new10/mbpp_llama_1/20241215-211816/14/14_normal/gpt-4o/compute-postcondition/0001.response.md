According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num` and `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers and `seen` is an empty set, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 integer and `num` is the first integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `seen` is an empty set, `num` is the first integer in the list**
