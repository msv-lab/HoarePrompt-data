Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a function `func_1` that checks if there are any duplicate elements in a given list of integers. It uses a set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far. The function iterates over the list, and for each element, it checks if the element is already in the set. If it is, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate has been found. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases:

- **Empty list**: An empty list contains no duplicates, so the function should return `False`. The code handles this case correctly because it simply returns `False` after iterating over an empty list without finding any elements.

- **List with unique elements**: A list with all unique elements should return `False`. The code handles this case correctly because it checks each element against the set and only returns `True` if a duplicate is found.

- **List with duplicate elements**: A list containing duplicate elements should return `True`. The code handles this case correctly because as soon as it encounters a duplicate (i.e., an element already in the set), it returns `True`.

- **List with multiple duplicates**: A list with multiple instances of the same element or different elements duplicated should return `True`. The code handles this case correctly for the same reason it handles lists with any duplicate elements: it returns `True` as soon as it finds a duplicate.

- **List with negative numbers or zero**: The code should handle lists containing negative numbers or zero correctly. Since the set data structure in Python can contain any immutable type, including negative integers and zero, the code correctly identifies duplicates regardless of the sign of the integers.

- **List with a large number of elements**: The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because looking up an element in a set is a constant time operation. Therefore, the function is efficient even for large lists.

In summary, the code provided correctly implements a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element, handling all potential cases as expected.
