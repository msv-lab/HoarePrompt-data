Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to determine whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. 

The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), it means the number is odd, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the remainder is 0, the number is even, and the function returns `False`.

This logic aligns perfectly with the definition of odd and even numbers in mathematics, where an odd number is any integer that cannot be exactly divided by 2, and an even number is any integer that can be exactly divided by 2.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the correctness of the function for both odd and even inputs. 

Therefore, the program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, making it correct for determining the parity of a given number as odd or even.
