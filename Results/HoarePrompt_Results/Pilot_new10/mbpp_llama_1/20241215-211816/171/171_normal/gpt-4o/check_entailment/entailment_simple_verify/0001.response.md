The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial assessment of the program's correctness. 

We have a problem description that asks for a Python function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided program defines a function `func_1(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, which aligns with the problem description.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers.

Given the information available, the program is correct based on the problem description. The function correctly determines whether a given number is odd or even.

Final: **True**
