The problem description requires writing a Python function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. The original assessment is `None`, indicating no initial judgment on the correctness of the function.

Upon examining the function, it takes an integer `n` as input and uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. If the remainder is not zero (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. This logic aligns perfectly with the definition of an odd number in mathematics.

The annotated version of the code reinforces this understanding by stating that "The program returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even," which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Given the information provided and the analysis of the code, the original assessment not having any judgment seems to be a lack of initial review rather than an indication of correctness. However, based on the code and its logic, it accurately implements the function to check if a number is odd.

Therefore, considering the code's implementation aligns with the mathematical definition of odd numbers and the problem description, and given that the annotated version supports this understanding, the final assessment of the program's correctness should be that the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
