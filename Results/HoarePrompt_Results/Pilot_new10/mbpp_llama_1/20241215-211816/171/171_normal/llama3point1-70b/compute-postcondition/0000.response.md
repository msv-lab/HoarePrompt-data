To determine the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code `return n % 2!= 0` checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. This essentially checks if `n` is an odd number, because in modulo operation, any odd number divided by 2 will leave a remainder of 1.

Given that `n` is an integer, the expression `n % 2!= 0` will evaluate to `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

Output State: **The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer**
