Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to determine whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), it indicates that the number is odd.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases for integer inputs, both positive and negative, as well as zero. For example:

- For any even number (e.g., 2, 4, 6), `n % 2` will be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`, indicating the number is not odd.
- For any odd number (e.g., 1, 3, 5), `n % 2` will not be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `True`, indicating the number is odd.
- For negative numbers, the modulus operation in Python returns a result with the same sign as the divisor (2 in this case), which is positive. Therefore, `-1 % 2` equals 1, indicating that -1 is odd, and `-2 % 2` equals 0, indicating that -2 is even.
- For zero, `0 % 2` equals 0, correctly identifying zero as not odd.

Given that the function correctly handles all integer inputs and edge cases (including zero and negative numbers) according to the problem description, it is concluded that the program is correct.
