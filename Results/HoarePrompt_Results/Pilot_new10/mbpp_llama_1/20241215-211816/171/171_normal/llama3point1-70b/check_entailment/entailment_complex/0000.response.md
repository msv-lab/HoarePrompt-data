Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. Here's why:

1. The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. This is a standard approach to check for parity in integers.
2. The expression `n % 2!= 0` evaluates to `True` if `n` is an odd integer (since the remainder of an odd number divided by 2 is always 1) and `False` if `n` is an even integer (since the remainder of an even number divided by 2 is always 0).
3. The function works correctly for all integer values, including positive, negative, and zero. The modulus operator in Python handles negative numbers correctly, and the function will return the expected result for zero (which is considered an even number).

Therefore, the program meets the problem description's requirements, and the correctness of the program is **True**. The function will always return `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, as specified in the problem description.
