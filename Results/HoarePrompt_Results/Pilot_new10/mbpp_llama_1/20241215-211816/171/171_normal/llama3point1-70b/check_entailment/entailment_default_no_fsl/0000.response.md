Correctness: **True**
The code is correct and works as expected for every potential case. The function `func_1(n)` checks if the remainder of the division of `n` by 2 is not equal to 0, which is a valid way to determine if a number is odd. The output hints confirm that the function works correctly for all integer values, including positive, negative, and zero. The function correctly returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, as demonstrated by the following examples:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` because 1 is an odd integer.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` because 2 is an even integer.
- `func_1(-1)` returns `True` because -1 is an odd integer.
- `func_1(-2)` returns `False` because -2 is an even integer.
- `func_1(0)` returns `False` because 0 is an even integer.

Overall, the function `func_1(n)` meets the requirements of the problem description, correctly determining the parity of a given number as odd or even for all integer values.
