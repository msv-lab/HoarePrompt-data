Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple and straightforward function that checks whether the parity of a given number is odd. It uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of the number `n` by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is even. 

This approach works correctly for all integer values, including positive, negative, and zero. For example, `func_1(3)` will return `True` because 3 is odd, `func_1(4)` will return `False` because 4 is even, and `func_1(-3)` will return `True` because -3 is also odd. The output hints agree with the code and confirm its correctness for all integer values.
