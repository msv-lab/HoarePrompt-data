The original assessment is "None", which implies that no evaluation of the program's correctness was made. 

Given the problem description, which asks to write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, and the provided code, we can see that the function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. This logic aligns with the definition of odd parity in the context of numbers, where an odd number is considered to have odd parity.

The annotated version of the code reinforces this understanding by stating that the program returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer, which directly corresponds to identifying odd parity.

Therefore, based on the provided code and its alignment with the problem description, the program appears to be correct in terms of accomplishing its intended task.

The reason to accept the correctness of the program is that it accurately identifies whether a given number has odd parity (is odd) or even parity (is even) through the modulo operation (`n % 2!= 0`), which is a standard method for determining if a number is odd or even.

Final: **True**
