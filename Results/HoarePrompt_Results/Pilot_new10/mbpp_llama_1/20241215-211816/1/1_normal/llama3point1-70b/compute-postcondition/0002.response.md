To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's break down the code and the provided annotations.

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. The annotations and the parameter names suggest that these should be tuples, but the initial state comment before the function call mentions them as lists. However, the function's operation treats them as sets (which are then converted back to a tuple), so the distinction between lists and tuples in terms of input is somewhat irrelevant for the function's core operation. What's crucial is that the function can handle any iterable as input.

2. The operation `set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2)` converts both inputs into sets (which automatically removes any duplicate elements within each set) and then finds the intersection of these two sets, which are the elements common to both.

3. The result of this intersection is then converted back into a tuple using `tuple(...)`, which is what the function returns.

Considering these points:

- **Input Type**: Despite the initial comment mentioning `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as lists, the function's behavior is defined by how it treats the inputs as sets, which applies to any iterable.
- **Return Value**: A tuple containing the common elements of both inputs, with no duplicates.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If either `test_tup1` or `test_tup2` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple because the intersection of any set with an empty set is empty.
  - If there are no common elements between `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, the function will return an empty tuple.
  - The function does not handle the case where inputs are not iterables; it will throw an error if either input is not something that can be converted into a set.

Given this analysis, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two iterables, finds the unique elements common to both, and returns them as a tuple; it returns an empty tuple if there are no common elements or if either input is empty, and it may throw an error if the inputs are not iterables. **
