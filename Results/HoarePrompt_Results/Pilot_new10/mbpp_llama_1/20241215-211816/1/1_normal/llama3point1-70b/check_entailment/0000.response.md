Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements from the two input tuples. 

Here's an explanation of why this code works correctly:

1. The function converts the input tuples to sets using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`.
2. It then uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives us the elements that are common to both sets.
3. Finally, it converts the intersection back to a tuple using `tuple()` and returns it.

This approach works because sets in Python automatically eliminate duplicates, and the intersection operation gives us the elements that are present in both sets. 

This function handles all potential cases correctly:

- It handles duplicate elements in the input lists correctly, because sets automatically eliminate duplicates.
- It handles empty input lists correctly, because the intersection of two empty sets is an empty set, which is converted to an empty tuple and returned.
- It handles input lists with no common elements correctly, because the intersection of two sets with no common elements is an empty set, which is converted to an empty tuple and returned.

Therefore, this function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
