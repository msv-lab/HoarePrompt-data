Based on the problem description and the provided code, it seems that the original assessment is not available, so we will directly evaluate the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two iterables, converts them to sets, and returns the intersection of the two sets as a tuple.

The output hints suggest that the function returns the unique elements common to both iterables as a tuple, which aligns with the problem description.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the code does not explicitly check if the inputs are lists, but rather if they are iterables. This is not necessarily a problem, since the problem description does not explicitly state that the inputs must be lists. Nevertheless, the code behaves as expected for the problem description.

One potential issue is that the function does not preserve the original order of the elements, since it converts the inputs to sets. However, the problem description does not specify that the order of the elements should be preserved, so this is not necessarily a flaw.

Considering all the information available, we can conclude that the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints.

Final: **True**
