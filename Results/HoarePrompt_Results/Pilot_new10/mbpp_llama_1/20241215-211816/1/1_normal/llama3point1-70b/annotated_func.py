#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elements common to both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` lists, with no duplicate elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two iterables, finds the unique elements common to both, and returns them as a tuple; it returns an empty tuple if there are no common elements or if either input is empty, and it may throw an error if the inputs are not iterables.
