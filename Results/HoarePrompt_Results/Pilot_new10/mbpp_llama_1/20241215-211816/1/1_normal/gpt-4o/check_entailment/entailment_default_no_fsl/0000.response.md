Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists (or more precisely, tuples in this case) as input and returns a tuple of common elements between them in ascending order. The function uses the built-in `set` data structure to find the intersection of the two input lists, which effectively identifies the common elements. It then converts this intersection back into a tuple, sorts it in ascending order using the `sorted` function, and returns the result.

The code handles various cases correctly:

1. **Common Elements:** It successfully identifies and returns common elements between two lists, as demonstrated in the provided assertions.
2. **No Common Elements:** Although not explicitly shown in the assertions, if there were no common elements between `list1` and `list2`, the function would correctly return an empty tuple. This is because the intersection of two sets with no common elements is an empty set, which when converted to a tuple, results in an empty tuple.
3. **Duplicate Elements:** The use of sets automatically eliminates duplicate elements, ensuring that each common element is only included once in the output tuple.
4. **Order of Elements:** The `sorted` function ensures that the common elements are always returned in ascending order, regardless of their original order in the input lists.

The output hints align with the code's functionality, indicating that the function is designed to work with hashable and comparable elements, which is a characteristic of the elements in the provided assertions (integers). If the input lists contained non-hashable or non-comparable elements (like lists or dictionaries), the function could indeed raise a TypeError, as indicated by the output hints.

Given that the code correctly implements the described functionality and handles various potential cases as expected, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
