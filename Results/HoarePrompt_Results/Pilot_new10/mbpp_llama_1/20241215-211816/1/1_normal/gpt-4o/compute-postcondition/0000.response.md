To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is that `list1` and `list2` are lists. The code snippet is `common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)`. 

This line of code converts `list1` and `list2` into sets (which are unordered collections of unique elements) and then uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of these two sets, which gives a new set containing all elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`. This resulting set is assigned to the variable `common_elements`.

Given that `list1` and `list2` are lists, their contents are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact elements that will be in `common_elements`. However, we can say that `common_elements` will be a set containing elements common to both `list1` and `list2`.

The states of `list1` and `list2` are not changed by this operation; they remain lists. A new variable, `common_elements`, is introduced, which is a set.

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, and `common_elements` is a set of elements common to `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, and `common_elements` is a set equal to `set(list1) & set(list2)`**
