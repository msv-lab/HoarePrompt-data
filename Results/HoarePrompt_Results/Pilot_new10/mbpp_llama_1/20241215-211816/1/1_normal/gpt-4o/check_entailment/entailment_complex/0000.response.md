Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. The provided Python function `func_1` does exactly that.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Finding shared elements**: The function uses the set intersection operation `set(list1) & set(list2)` to find the common elements between the two lists. This operation returns a set containing only the elements that are present in both lists.
2. **Returning a tuple**: The function converts the resulting set of common elements to a tuple using the `tuple()` function. This meets the requirement of returning a tuple of shared elements.
3. **Ascending order**: The function sorts the common elements in ascending order using the `sorted()` function before returning them as a tuple. This ensures that the returned tuple always contains the shared elements in the correct order.
4. **Handling empty intersection**: If there are no common elements between the two lists, the set intersection operation will return an empty set. The function will then return an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality, and its behavior aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
