The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists, and returns a tuple of common elements between `list1` and `list2` in ascending order.

Looking at the code line by line, the function first finds the common elements between `list1` and `list2` by converting them to sets and performing an intersection operation. This means that if there are duplicate elements in either `list1` or `list2`, they will be removed in the resulting set of common elements. 

The function then sorts the common elements in ascending order and returns them as a tuple.

Potential edge cases to consider:

- If `list1` and `list2` have no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple.
- If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple.
- If `list1` and `list2` contain non-comparable elements (e.g., strings and integers), the function may raise a TypeError when trying to sort the common elements.
- If `list1` and `list2` contain unhashable elements (e.g., lists or dictionaries), the function will raise a TypeError when trying to convert them to sets.

Considering these edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a tuple of common elements between them in ascending order. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple. The function assumes that the elements in the lists are hashable and comparable, and may raise a TypeError if this is not the case. **
