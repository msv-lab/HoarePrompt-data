Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tup)` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Here's why I believe the code is correct:

- The function uses a set comprehension `(type(x) for x in tup)` to generate a set of unique data types found in the tuple.
- The `len` function checks the number of unique data types in the set.
- If all elements in the tuple have the same data type, the set will contain only one element (i.e., `len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1`), and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

I couldn't find any potential case where this function does not work as expected. It handles tuples with different data types, tuples with the same data type, empty tuples (which returns `True` because there are no elements to compare), and tuples with nested structures (which works because `type` checks the outermost type).

For example:
```python
print(func_1((1, 2, 3)))  # True
print(func_1((1, 'a', 3)))  # False
print(func_1(()))  # True
print(func_1((1, 2, [3])))  # False
```
