Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function `func_1` iterates over each element in the tuple and compares its type with the type of the first element. If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all elements without finding any with a different type, it returns `True`.

The program handles the edge case where the tuple is empty by returning `True` immediately, which is correct according to the problem description since there are no elements with different types in an empty tuple.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for tuples containing elements of any data type, including integers, strings, floats, etc., and also handles the case where the tuple is empty. The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function for various scenarios.

The function is well-structured and readable, making it easy to understand and verify its correctness. Since we can't think of any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
