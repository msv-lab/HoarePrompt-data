According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, `element` is `tup[0]` and is of type `first_type`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `tup` must have at least two elements, `element` must be `tup[1]`, and the type of `element` must be equal to the type of `tup[1]`.
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must have at least two elements, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, `element` is `tup[1]` and is of type equal to the type of `tup[1]`**
