Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type by comparing the type of each element with the type of the first element. If the tuple is empty, it immediately returns True, as there are no elements to check. If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns False. If it checks all elements without finding any with a different type, it returns True. This approach covers all potential cases, including empty tuples, tuples with a single element, and tuples with multiple elements of the same or different types. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios. The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
