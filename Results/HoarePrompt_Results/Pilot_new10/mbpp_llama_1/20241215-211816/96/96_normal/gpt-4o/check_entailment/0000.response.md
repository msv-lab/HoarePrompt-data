Correctness: **True**.

I believe the code is correct because it checks the type of each element in the tuple and returns False as soon as it finds an element with a different type. If the tuple is empty, it returns True because there are no elements to check. 

The code handles all potential cases, including:

- An empty tuple: It correctly returns True.
- A tuple with only one element: It correctly returns True.
- A tuple with multiple elements of the same type: It correctly returns True.
- A tuple with multiple elements of different types: It correctly returns False.

The code uses a simple and efficient approach to check the types of all elements in the tuple. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the tuple, because it checks each element once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the type of the first element.

I couldn't think of any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
