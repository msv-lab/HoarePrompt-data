The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value based on certain conditions. The conditions are not explicitly stated, but the return values are as follows: 
Case_1: The function returns `True`, 
Case_2, Case_3, Case_4: The function returns `False`, 
Case_5: The function returns `True` if all elements in `tup` are of the same type as `tup[0]`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `tup` are of the same type as the first element `tup[0]` or meeting other unspecified conditions.
Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple tup and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in tup are of the same type as tup[0] or meeting other conditions.**
