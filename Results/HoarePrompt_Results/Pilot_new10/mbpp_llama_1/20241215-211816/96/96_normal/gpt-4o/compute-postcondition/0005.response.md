Postcondition: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, the initial type of `tup[0]` is `first_type`, `element` is `tup[0]` and initially is of type `first_type`. However, the current value of `element` is not of type `first_type`, indicating a type mismatch where the type of `element` is different from the initially defined `first_type`.**
