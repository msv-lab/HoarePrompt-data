The original assessment is None, which means there is no initial assessment to evaluate. Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I can determine the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks to write a function to check if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type or not. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks if all its elements are of the same type as the first element. If the tuple is empty, it returns True.

The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, returning True if the tuple is empty or if all its elements are of the same type as the first element, and False otherwise.

The provided code seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. It handles the case where the tuple is empty and returns True, and it correctly checks the type of each element in the tuple.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
