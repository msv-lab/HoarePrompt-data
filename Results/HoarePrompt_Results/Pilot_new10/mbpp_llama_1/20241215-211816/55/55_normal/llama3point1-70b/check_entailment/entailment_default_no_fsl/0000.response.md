Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string. In camel case, the first word is typically in lower case, not capitalized. The provided function capitalizes every word, including the first one. 

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the function will return "HelloWorld", but the correct camel case conversion should be "helloWorld". 

This issue arises because the function uses the `capitalize()` method on every word, including the first one, which is not the expected behavior for camel case conversion. 

To fix this, the function should only capitalize the words starting from the second one, leaving the first word in lower case. 

Here's an example of a corrected function:
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
