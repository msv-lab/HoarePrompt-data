You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_case_str is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore.
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
    #To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code's impact:
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, with each word separated by a single underscore.
    #   - `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`. This implies that `words` has been split from `snake_case_str` based on the underscore.
    #   - `camel_case_str` is a string created by joining each word in `words` (which are first capitalized) without any separator.
    #
    #2. **Code Impact**: 
    #   - The code `return camel_case_str` simply returns the value of `camel_case_str`.
    #
    #Given the transformation from `snake_case_str` to `camel_case_str`, we know that each word in `snake_case_str` (separated by underscores) is capitalized and then joined together without any separators to form `camel_case_str`.
    #
    #**Output State**: **The program returns a camel case string where the first word is the first word of `snake_case_str` capitalized, and each subsequent word is also capitalized, all joined together without any separators.**

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
