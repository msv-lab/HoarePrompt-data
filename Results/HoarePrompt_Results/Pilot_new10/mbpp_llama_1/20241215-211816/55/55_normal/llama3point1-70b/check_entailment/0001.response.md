Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string. In camel case, the first word is supposed to be in lowercase, but the given program capitalizes every word.

A counterexample is the string "hello_world". The correct camel case conversion should be "helloWorld", but the given program returns "HelloWorld". 

To correctly implement the conversion, the program should capitalize all words except the first one. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```

This corrected version of the function will correctly convert snake case strings to camel case strings.
