Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The issue is with the capitalization of the first word. In camel case, the first word is supposed to be in lowercase, while subsequent words are capitalized. However, the provided program capitalizes all words, including the first one.

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the program will return "HelloWorld" instead of "helloWorld". This is because the program uses the `capitalize()` method on every word, without making an exception for the first word.

To fix this, the program should only capitalize the first letter of the first word if the rest of the words have been correctly capitalized and then joined together, but since the first word should be all lowercase, the program can capitalize each word after the first word has been joined. Here's an example of a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
    return camel_case_str
```

In this corrected version, the first word is left in lowercase (as it is already), and the rest of the words are capitalized using a list slice (`words[1:]`) to exclude the first word from the capitalization process.
