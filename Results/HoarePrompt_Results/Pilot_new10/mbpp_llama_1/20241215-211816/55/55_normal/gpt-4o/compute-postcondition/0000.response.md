The given Python code splits the `snake_str` into components separated by the underscore character. Since `snake_str` is a valid snake case string, it contains only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, with words separated by single underscores.

The `split('_')` method splits the string into a list where each word between underscores becomes a separate element in the list.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string that is a valid snake case string, `components` is a list of strings where each string represents a word from `snake_str` separated by underscores.**
