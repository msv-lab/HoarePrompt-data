Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to convert a snake case string to camel case string, but the code provided actually converts the snake case string to Pascal case string. The difference is that in camel case, the first word should not be capitalized, whereas in Pascal case, the first word is also capitalized.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is 'hello_world'. The correct output should be 'helloWorld', but the provided code will output 'HelloWorld'. 

The provided code uses `x.capitalize()` for every component, which capitalizes the first letter of each word. Instead, it should only capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word. 

The output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect, as they mention that the code converts snake case strings to Pascal case strings, not camel case strings. 

To fix the code, it should be changed to not capitalize the first component. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```
