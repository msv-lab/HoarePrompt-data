Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not follow the problem description for the case where the input string is already in camel case, but the first character should be in lower case. For example, the string 'hello_world' should be converted to 'helloWorld', but the program will convert it to 'HelloWorld'. 

In camel case, the first word is typically in lower case, but the provided function capitalizes the first word as well, resulting in Pascal case instead of camel case. 

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to not capitalize the first word. Here's an example of the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```
