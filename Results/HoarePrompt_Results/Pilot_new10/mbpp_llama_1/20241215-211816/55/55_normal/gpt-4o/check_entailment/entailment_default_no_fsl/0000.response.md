Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it converts snake case strings to Pascal case, not camel case. In camel case, the first word is typically in lowercase, whereas in Pascal case, the first word is capitalized.

For example, the snake case string 'hello_world' should be converted to 'helloWorld' in camel case, but the provided function would convert it to 'HelloWorld'. 

To correctly implement the conversion to camel case, the function should capitalize the first letter of each component except for the first one. The corrected function would be:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```
