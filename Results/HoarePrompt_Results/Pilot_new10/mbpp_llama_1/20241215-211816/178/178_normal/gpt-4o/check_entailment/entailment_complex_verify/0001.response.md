The original assessment is None, which means there is no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. 

Upon examining the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, we can see that the code accurately implements the required functionality. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear description of the program's state at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior. The function does not handle empty lists or lists with non-numeric values, but as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
