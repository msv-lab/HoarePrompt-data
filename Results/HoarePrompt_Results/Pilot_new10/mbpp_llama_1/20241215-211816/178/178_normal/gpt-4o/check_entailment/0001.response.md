Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct. It meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. 

The provided unit tests also pass, confirming the correctness of the function. 

In every potential case, the function works as expected. It correctly handles lists of numbers with both positive and negative values, as well as lists with a mix of integers and floating-point numbers. 

The code is concise, readable, and well-structured, making it easy to understand and verify its correctness. 

No edge cases have been found where the program does not work as expected, so the correctness of the program is confirmed.
