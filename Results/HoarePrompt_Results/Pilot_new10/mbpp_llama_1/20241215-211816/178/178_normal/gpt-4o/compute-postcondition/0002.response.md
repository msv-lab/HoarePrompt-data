The variable `result` is assigned the value of `total_sum` multiplied by the length of the list `numbers`. The value of `total_sum` is equal to the sum of the rounded numbers in the list `rounded_numbers`, which in turn is equal to the sum of the rounded numbers in the list `numbers`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded numbers where each number is equal to `round(num)` for each `num` in `numbers`, `total_sum` is equal to `sum(rounded_numbers)`, and `result` is equal to `total_sum * len(numbers)`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded numbers where each number is equal to `round(num)` for each `num` in `numbers`, `total_sum` is equal to `sum(rounded_numbers)`, and `result` is equal to `sum(rounded_numbers) * len(numbers)`**
