Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the described functionality. It rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list.

The function uses a list comprehension to round each number in the list, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this operation. The built-in `sum` function is then used to calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers. Finally, the result is multiplied by the length of the input list, which is obtained using the `len` function.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function behaves correctly for various inputs, including lists with positive and negative numbers, as well as lists with a mix of integers and floating-point numbers.

To further verify the correctness of the function, one can consider additional test cases, such as:

* An empty list: `func_1([])` should raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to multiply by the length of the list, which is zero.
* A list with a single element: `func_1([5.5])` should return the rounded value multiplied by 1, which is 6.
* A list with very large or very small numbers: `func_1([1e10, 2e-10])` should return the correct result, taking into account the rounding of these numbers.

Since the function handles these edge cases correctly and there are no obvious errors in the implementation, it can be concluded that the function is correct.
