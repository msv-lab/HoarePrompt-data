To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the operation performed by the code.

1. `numbers` is a list of numbers.
2. `rounded_numbers` is a list where each number is the rounded version of the corresponding number in `numbers`, using the `round()` function.
3. `total_sum` is the sum of all the numbers in `rounded_numbers`.

The code returns `total_sum * len(numbers)`. Here's what we know about the components of this expression:

- `total_sum` is the sum of the rounded numbers, which means it's the sum of integers since `round()` rounds to the nearest integer.
- `len(numbers)` gives the count of how many numbers are in the `numbers` list.

Therefore, the return value is the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers in the list.

Output State: **The program returns the product of the sum of rounded numbers and the total count of numbers, where each rounded number is obtained by rounding the corresponding number in the list `numbers` to the nearest integer.**
