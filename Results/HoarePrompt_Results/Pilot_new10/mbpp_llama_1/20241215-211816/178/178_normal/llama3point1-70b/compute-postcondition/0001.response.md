`total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of all numbers in `rounded_numbers`. The value of `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded numbers where each number is equal to `round(num)` for each `num` in `numbers`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded numbers where each number is equal to `round(num)` for each `num` in `numbers`, `total_sum` is equal to the sum of `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded numbers where each number is equal to `round(num)` for each `num` in `numbers`, `total_sum` is equal to the sum of `rounded_numbers`**
