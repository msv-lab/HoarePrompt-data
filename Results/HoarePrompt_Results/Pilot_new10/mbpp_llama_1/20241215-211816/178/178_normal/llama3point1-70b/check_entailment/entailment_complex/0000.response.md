Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The problem description asks to write a function that rounds every number in a given list of numbers.
2. The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and uses a list comprehension to round each number to the nearest integer, storing the result in `rounded_numbers`.
3. The program then calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function and stores it in `total_sum`.
4. Finally, the program returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of the input list `numbers`, which is equivalent to multiplying the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the list.

The program also handles the edge case where the input list is empty, because in this case, `sum` will return 0 and `len` will return 0, resulting in a return value of 0, which is consistent with the problem description.

Note that the problem description does not specify what to do with non-numeric values or potential overflow errors, so the program's assumption that all elements in the list are numeric and its lack of error handling for these cases do not make it incorrect. However, in a real-world application, it would be a good idea to add error handling to make the program more robust. 

The program always does what the problem description says because it follows the exact steps outlined in the problem description: rounding the numbers, calculating the sum, and returning the product of the sum and the length of the list.
