Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number in the list using the `round` function, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list.

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. It rounds every number in the given list using a list comprehension: `[round(num) for num in numbers]`.
2. It calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function: `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`.
3. It multiplies the total sum by the length of the input list: `return total_sum * len(numbers)`.

Considering various potential cases:

- **Empty list**: If an empty list is passed, the `sum` function will return 0 (since the sum of no numbers is 0), and `len(numbers)` will return 0, resulting in a return value of 0 * 0 = 0, which aligns with the mathematical interpretation of the operation on an empty set of numbers.
- **List with integers**: The `round` function will not change integer values, so the function behaves as expected by summing the integers and multiplying by the count of integers.
- **List with floats**: The `round` function will round each float to the nearest integer, and then the function proceeds as expected, summing these rounded values and multiplying by the count of floats.

Since the code handles all identified potential cases and edge cases correctly according to the problem description, it is considered correct.
