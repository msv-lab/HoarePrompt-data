To determine the final correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the original program, and the annotated version.

The problem description asks to write a function that rounds every number in a given list of numbers and then prints the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The key components of this task are:
1. Round each number in the list.
2. Calculate the sum of these rounded numbers.
3. Multiply this sum by the length of the list.
4. Print the result.

Given Program:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
```

The original assessment is "None," which implies there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness based on the problem description.

The annotated version of the code provides insight into the program's state at different points:
- Before the function call, `numbers` is a list of numbers.
- After executing the function, the program returns the product of the sum of rounded numbers and the total count of numbers.

However, there's a discrepancy between the problem description and the program's behavior:
- The problem description explicitly mentions printing the result, but the program returns the result instead of printing it.

Considering the above analysis, the original assessment's lack of feedback does not provide any insights into the program's correctness. However, upon examining the annotated version and comparing it with the problem description, it becomes clear that the program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description due to the omission of printing the result.

Therefore, based on the strict interpretation of the problem description, which requires printing the result, and the program's actual behavior of returning the result, the program does not fully comply with the specified requirements.

Final: **False**
