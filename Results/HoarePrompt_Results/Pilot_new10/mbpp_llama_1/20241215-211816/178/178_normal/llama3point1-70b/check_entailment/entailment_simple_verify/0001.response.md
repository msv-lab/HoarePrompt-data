The original assessment is "None", which does not provide any information about the correctness of the program. 

However, based on the problem description, the program is supposed to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that rounds every number in the list and calculates the total sum multiplied by the length of the list, but it does not print the result. Instead, it returns the result.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior, stating that "The program returns the product of the sum of rounded numbers and the total count of numbers...". 

Given this information, it appears that the program does not fully match the problem description, as it returns the result instead of printing it.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**
