Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It utilizes the `isinstance` function to check if each element in the list is an instance of the `int` type, and the `sum` function to count the total number of integers. 

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for lists containing various types of elements, including integers, floats, strings, and other data types. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

Since the function correctly handles all possible cases, including empty lists and lists containing only non-integer elements, and the provided unit tests pass, the code is correct. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results, based on the provided problem description. 

The code is also concise, readable, and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain. Therefore, the correctness of the provided Python function is confirmed.
