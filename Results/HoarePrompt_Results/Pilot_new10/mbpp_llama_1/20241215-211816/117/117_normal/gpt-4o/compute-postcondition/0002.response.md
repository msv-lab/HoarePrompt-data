The function func_1 accepts a list parameter lst and returns the count of integers in the list. 

Looking at the code, it checks each element in the list to see if it's an integer using isinstance(x, int). If the element is an integer, it counts it. The code seems to handle all potential cases as it checks every element in the list. 

Potential edge cases include: 
- An empty list: The function will return 0, as there are no integers to count.
- A list with no integers: The function will return 0.
- A list with a mix of integers and other types: The function will count only the integers.
- A list containing non-hashable types (like lists or dictionaries) that are also instances of some subclass of int (e.g., numpy.int64): These will be counted as integers.
- A list containing integers and other numeric types (like floats): Only the integers will be counted.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list and returns the count of elements in the list that are instances of int, handling empty lists, lists with no integers, and lists with a mix of integers and other types, including non-hashable types that are instances of some subclass of int **
