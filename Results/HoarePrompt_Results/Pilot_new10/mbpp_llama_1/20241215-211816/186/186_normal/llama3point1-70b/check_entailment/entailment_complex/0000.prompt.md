You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from tuples `tup1` and `tup2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, stopping at the end of the shorter tuple if they are of different lengths, and assuming all elements can undergo bitwise AND operations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
