#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from tuples `tup1` and `tup2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, stopping at the end of the shorter tuple if they are of different lengths, and assuming all elements can undergo bitwise AND operations.
