Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided function performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from the two tuples, rather than extracting elementwise "and" or performing a logical AND operation.

The function uses the `&` operator, which is a bitwise AND operator, not a logical AND operator. This means it will perform a binary operation on the bits of the corresponding elements, rather than checking if both elements are true.

For example, if `tup1 = (True, False)` and `tup2 = (True, True)`, the function will return `(True, False)`, because `True & True` is `True` and `False & True` is `False`. However, if the tuples contained integers, the result would be the bitwise AND of those integers, which is not the same as a logical AND operation.

To meet the problem description, the function would need to perform a logical AND operation on the corresponding elements, which would require using the `and` keyword or a different approach. 

Here is an example of how the function could be modified to meet the problem description:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x and y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This modified function uses a generator expression to create a tuple where each element is the logical AND of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. This would meet the problem description, assuming that "elementwise and tuples" means performing a logical AND operation on corresponding elements.
