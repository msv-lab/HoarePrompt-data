The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `tuple` function to iterate over the elements of `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel using the `zip` function. For each pair of corresponding elements `x` and `y` from `tup1` and `tup2`, respectively, it computes the bitwise AND operation `x & y`. The results of these bitwise AND operations are collected into a new tuple, which is then returned by the function.

However, it's crucial to note that the function does not explicitly handle potential edge cases, such as when `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths. In such cases, `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to elements from the longer tuple being ignored. Additionally, the function assumes that all elements within the tuples can be subject to a bitwise AND operation, which may not be the case if the tuples contain non-integer or non-boolean values.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, stopping at the end of the shorter tuple if they are of different lengths, and assuming all elements can undergo bitwise AND operations. **
