Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided uses the `zip` function to iterate over corresponding elements from the two input tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`. It then uses a generator expression to compute the bitwise AND of each pair of elements using the `&` operator. The results are combined into a tuple using the `tuple` function.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description by performing element-wise bitwise AND operations between the two input tuples. The `zip` function automatically stops at the end of the shorter tuple, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`, demonstrate the correctness of the implementation for various input cases.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, up to the length of the shorter tuple.

Since the code correctly implements the desired functionality and passes the provided unit tests, it can be concluded that the code is correct and works as expected for every potential case.
