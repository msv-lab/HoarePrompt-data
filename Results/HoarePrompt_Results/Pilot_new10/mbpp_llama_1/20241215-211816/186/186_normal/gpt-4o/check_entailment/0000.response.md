Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, but it is actually performing a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the two tuples. This is not the same as "extracting" the elements, and the result of the bitwise AND operation may not be what the user expects.

For example, if the input tuples are `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the function will return `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the two tuples. However, it is not clear what "extracting" the elements means in this context, and the function may not be doing what the user expects.

A correct implementation of the function would depend on what is meant by "elementwise and tuples". If it means performing a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the two tuples, then the function is correct. However, if it means something else, then the function is incorrect.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

If the input tuples are `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, and the user expects the function to return a tuple containing the elements of the two tuples, then the function will not work correctly. Instead of returning `((1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), (4, 8))`, the function will return `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the two tuples.
