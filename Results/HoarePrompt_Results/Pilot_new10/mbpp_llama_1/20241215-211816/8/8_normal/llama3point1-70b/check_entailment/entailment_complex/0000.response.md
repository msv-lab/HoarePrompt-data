Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program checks for the first and last occurrences of the given character using `find()` and `rfind()` methods. If the character is not found, these methods return -1.

2. If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once in the string), the program removes this single occurrence using `replace()` method and returns the resulting string.

3. If the character appears more than once in the string, the program removes the first and last occurrences by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at the last occurrence), and after the last occurrence.

4. If the character is not present in the string or appears only once, the program returns the original string.

The program handles all possible cases:

- If the character appears more than once, it correctly removes the first and last occurrences.
- If the character appears only once, it removes this single occurrence.
- If the character is not present in the string, it returns the original string.

Therefore, the program always follows the problem description, and its correctness is verified.
