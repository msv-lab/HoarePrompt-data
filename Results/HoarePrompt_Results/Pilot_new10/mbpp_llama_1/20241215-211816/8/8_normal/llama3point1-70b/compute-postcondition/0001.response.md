The code assigns the value of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` to `last_occurrence`. The `rfind` method returns the highest index of the substring `char` in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character that is present at least twice in `s`, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character that is present at least twice in `s`, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, which is equal to `s.rfind(char)`**
