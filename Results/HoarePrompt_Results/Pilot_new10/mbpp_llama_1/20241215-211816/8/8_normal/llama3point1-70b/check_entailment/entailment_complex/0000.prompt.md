You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character that is present at least twice in s.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns a string where the single occurrence of `char` has been removed from `s`.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, where `s` is the original string, and `char` is a character that appears at least twice in `s`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns string 's' which contains character 'char' with 'first_occurrence' and 'last_occurrence' being either valid indices of 'char' in 's' or -1 if 'char' is not present in 's' or not present at least twice
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and a character `char`, and returns a new string where the first and last occurrences of `char` are removed if `char` appears more than once in `s`, or the original string `s` if `char` appears once or not at all in `s`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
