The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `char`, where `s` is a string and `char` is a single character that is present at least twice in `s`. 

After executing the function body, the function returns a string based on the following conditions: 
1. If the single occurrence of `char` has been removed from `s`, the function returns this modified string.
2. If the first and last occurrences of `char` are removed from `s`, the function returns this derived string.
3. The function also returns the original string `s` which contains character `char`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `char` that appears at least twice in `s`, and return a string based on the removal of `char` occurrences from `s`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `char`, and returns a string where either a single occurrence, the first and last occurrences, or no occurrences of `char` are removed from `s`.**
