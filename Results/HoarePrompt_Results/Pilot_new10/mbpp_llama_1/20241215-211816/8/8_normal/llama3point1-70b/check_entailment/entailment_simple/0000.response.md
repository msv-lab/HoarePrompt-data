Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program checks for the first and last occurrences of the given character in the string using `find()` and `rfind()`. This is the correct approach to locate these occurrences.

2. If the character appears only once in the string (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), the program uses the `replace()` method with a count of 1 to remove the single occurrence of the character. This aligns with the problem description's requirement to remove the first and last occurrence, which in this case are the same.

3. If the character appears more than once, the program slices the string to exclude the first and last occurrences of the character. This is done by concatenating three parts: the substring before the first occurrence (`s[:first_occurrence]`), the substring between the first and last occurrences (`s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`), and the substring after the last occurrence (`s[last_occurrence + 1:]`). This effectively removes the first and last occurrences of the character from the string.

4. The program handles the case where the character is not present in the string or appears less than twice by returning the original string. Although the problem description guarantees the presence of the character at least twice, the program's behavior in such edge cases is reasonable and does not contradict the problem description.

In summary, the program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string for all potential cases, including when the character appears only once or more than once, thereby meeting the requirements outlined in the problem description.
