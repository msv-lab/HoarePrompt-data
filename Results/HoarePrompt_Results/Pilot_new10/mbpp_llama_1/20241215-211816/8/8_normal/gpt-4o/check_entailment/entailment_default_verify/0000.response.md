To determine the final correctness of the program, we must carefully analyze the given problem description, the provided code, and the output hints.

The problem description asks for a Python function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` and a character `ch` as input. It uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to locate the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` appears less than twice in `s` (i.e., `first_index == -1`, `last_index == -1`, or `first_index == last_index`), the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it returns a modified string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.

The output hints provide a clear description of the function's behavior, which aligns with the problem description. However, upon closer inspection, we notice a discrepancy between the problem description and the output hints. The problem description asks to remove only the first and last occurrences of the given character, whereas the output hints describe a function that removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` and the substring between them (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves) if `ch` appears more than once in `s`.

The provided code actually implements the behavior described in the output hints, not the problem description. This means the original assessment (which is None) does not make sense based on the problem description and the provided code, as it does not acknowledge this discrepancy.

Given this analysis, we conclude that the program does not correctly implement the problem description as stated. The function removes more than just the first and last occurrences of the character when it appears more than once; it removes the substring between these occurrences as well.

Final: **False**
