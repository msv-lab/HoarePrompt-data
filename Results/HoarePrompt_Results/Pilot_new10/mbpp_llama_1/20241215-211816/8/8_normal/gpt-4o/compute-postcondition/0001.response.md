To determine the output state, we first examine the given initial state and the Python code snippet provided. 

The initial state is as follows:
- `s` is a string.
- `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`.
- `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
last_index = s.rfind(ch)
```
This line of code finds the last index of the character `ch` in the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `last_index`.

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code on the program state:

1. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it's a string.
2. The value of `ch` also remains unchanged; it's still a single character string that exists in `s`.
3. The value of `first_index` does not change; it's still the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
4. A new variable `last_index` is introduced, which holds the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.

Considering these points, the output state after executing the given Python code snippet is:

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
