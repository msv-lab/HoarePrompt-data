The `find` method in Python returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified character. Since `ch` exists at least once in `s`, `s.find(ch)` will return the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`. 

The value of `first_index` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`, and `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
