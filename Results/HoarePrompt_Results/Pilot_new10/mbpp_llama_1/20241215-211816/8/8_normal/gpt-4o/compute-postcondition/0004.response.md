Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. Additionally, `first_index` is not equal to -1, `last_index` is not equal to -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`, meaning that `ch` appears more than once in `s` and both the first and last occurrences of `ch` have valid indices.**
