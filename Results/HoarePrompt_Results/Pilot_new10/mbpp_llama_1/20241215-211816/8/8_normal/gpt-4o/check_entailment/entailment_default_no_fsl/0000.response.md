Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem statement asks to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string, but the code removes the entire substring between the first and last occurrence of the character, excluding the first and last character themselves.

For example, if the input string is "abca" and the character to be removed is "a", the code will return "b" instead of "bc". This is because the code removes the entire substring between the first and last "a", which is "bc".

To fix this, the code should only remove the first and last occurrence of the character, leaving the substring between them intact. 

Here is a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```
However, the last part `s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]` should be changed to `s[first_index + 1:]` to only remove the first occurrence of `ch` when `ch` appears more than once. Then remove the last occurrence of `ch` from the resulting string. Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:]
    return s.replace(ch, '', 1)
```
Or more accurately:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:]
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    return s[:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```
