To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze the provided annotated code and return postconditions step by step.

1. **Function Parameters and Return Type**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are expected to be tuples containing numbers (either integers or floats). The function returns a tuple.

2. **Functionality Based on Code**: The code uses a generator expression within the built-in `tuple` function to iterate over `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel using `zip`. For each pair of corresponding elements `a` from `tup1` and `b` from `tup2`, it calculates the difference `a - b` and includes this difference in the returned tuple.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
    - **Length Mismatch**: The code does not explicitly check if `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length. If they are not, `zip` will stop at the end of the shortest tuple, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the caller expects an error or a specific handling for tuples of different lengths.
    - **Non-Numeric Elements**: The annotations and return postconditions suggest that `tup1` and `tup2` should contain numbers. However, the code does not validate the types of elements within the tuples. If `tup1` or `tup2` contains non-numeric elements, attempting to subtract them could result in a TypeError.
    - **Empty Tuples**: If either `tup1` or `tup2` (or both) is an empty tuple, `zip` will not iterate over any elements, and the function will return an empty tuple. This behavior might be expected, but it's worth noting for completeness.

4. **Summary**: The function calculates the differences between corresponding elements in two input tuples and returns these differences as a tuple. It assumes the input tuples are of the same length and contain numeric elements (either integers or floats). If the tuples are of different lengths, it will return differences for the corresponding elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. If the tuples contain non-numeric elements, it may raise a TypeError. For empty tuples, it returns an empty tuple.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples of numbers, calculates the differences between corresponding elements, and returns these differences as a tuple, assuming the tuples are of the same length and contain numeric elements, with potential edge cases including length mismatches, non-numeric elements, and empty tuples. **
