Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths. The `zip` function in Python stops once the shortest input iterable is exhausted. For example, if we have `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the function will return `(1 - 4, 2 - 5) = (-3, -3)` but it will ignore the third element of `tup1` which is `3`. The correct output should be an error or an exception because the tuples are of different lengths and we cannot perform the subtraction operation as described in the problem. 

To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that the tuples are of the same length before performing the subtraction operation. 

Here is an example of how to modify the function to handle this case:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    if len(tup1)!= len(tup2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```
