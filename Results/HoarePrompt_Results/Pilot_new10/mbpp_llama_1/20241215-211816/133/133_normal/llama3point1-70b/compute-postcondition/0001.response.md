The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples of the same length containing numbers (either integers or floats). After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of numbers, `tup1` and `tup2`, and return a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in the input tuples.
Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples of numbers, tup1 and tup2, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in tup1 and tup2.**
