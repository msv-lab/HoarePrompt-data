Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The function `func_1` takes in two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input.
2. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.
3. For each pair of elements `a` and `b` from `tup1` and `tup2`, respectively, it subtracts `b` from `a` using the expression `a - b`.
4. The results of these subtractions are collected into a tuple using a generator expression, which is then returned by the function.

The key aspects that make this program correct are:

* It correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the elements of the first tuple, as required by the problem description.
* It handles tuples of the same length, as specified in the problem description.
* It returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements, which is the expected output.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for various input cases.

In general, this program will always produce the correct output for any two tuples of the same length, containing numeric elements, because:

* The `zip` function ensures that corresponding elements are paired correctly.
* The generator expression applies the subtraction operation element-wise, which is the required behavior.
* The resulting tuple is returned, which matches the expected output format.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
