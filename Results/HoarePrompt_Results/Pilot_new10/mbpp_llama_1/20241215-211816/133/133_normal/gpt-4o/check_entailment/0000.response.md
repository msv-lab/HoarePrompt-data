Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. The result is then converted back to a tuple using the `tuple` function.

This approach works correctly for tuples of the same length, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. Additionally, the function will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths, which is also a correct behavior according to the problem description (since the problem implies that the tuples should have the same length).

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any explicit error handling for cases where the tuples are not of the same length. But in Python, the `zip` function will stop once the shortest input iterable is exhausted, which means that if the tuples are of different lengths, the function will still work, but it will ignore the extra elements in the longer tuple.

In any case, the provided function works as expected for all the unit tests and for any other potential case where the tuples have the same length, so the correctness is **True**.
