Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

Here's why the program works as expected:

1. The `zip(tup1, tup2)` function is used to iterate over the elements of both tuples in parallel, which ensures that elements at the same index are paired together.
2. The generator expression `(a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2))` subtracts each element in `tup1` from the corresponding element in `tup2`.
3. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

All the provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different input tuples. Additionally, there are no edge cases that the program is not handling. For example, it correctly handles tuples of different signs (positive and negative) and tuples with different lengths (as long as they are the same length, which is a requirement specified in the problem description).

Since no potential case can be found where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
