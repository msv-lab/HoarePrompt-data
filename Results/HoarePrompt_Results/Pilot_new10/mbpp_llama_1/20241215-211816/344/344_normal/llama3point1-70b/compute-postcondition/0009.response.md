Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a sorted list with at least 3 elements, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and `i` is 2. If the third element of `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, the program returns 2. Otherwise, there is no specified action.***
