To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `sorted_list` is a sorted list of elements, and `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`.

The loop statement is: `for i in range(len(sorted_list)):`

For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `sorted_list` must exist and be accessible.
2. `sorted_list` must have at least one element for the loop to iterate over, because `range(len(sorted_list))` will be empty if `sorted_list` is empty.
3. `i` needs to be initialized before the loop starts, which in this case is handled by the `for` loop itself, starting `i` from 0.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that for the loop to execute:
- `sorted_list` must have at least one element.
- `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

The presence of `value` does not affect the execution of the loop itself but is part of the initial state.

State: **`sorted_list` is a sorted list that must have at least one element, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, `i` is 0**
