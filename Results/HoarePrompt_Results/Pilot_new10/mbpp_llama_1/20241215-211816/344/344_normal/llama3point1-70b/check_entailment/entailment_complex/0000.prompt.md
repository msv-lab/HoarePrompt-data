You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a sorted list of elements, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` remains a sorted list of elements, `value` remains an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and the function either returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value` or returns `None` if no such element is found.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the number of elements in the sorted list 'sorted_list'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list and a value, returning the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list, effectively handling cases where the value exceeds all elements in the list or when the input list is empty.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
