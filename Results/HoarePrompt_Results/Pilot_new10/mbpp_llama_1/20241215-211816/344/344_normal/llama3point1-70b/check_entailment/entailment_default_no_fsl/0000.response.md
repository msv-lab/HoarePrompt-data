Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a correct implementation of a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The function iterates over the sorted list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, it returns the total number of elements in the list, which effectively handles cases where the value exceeds all elements in the list or when the input list is empty.

This function works correctly for every potential case:

- When the value is less than the first element in the list, the function will return 0, which is the correct insertion point.
- When the value is equal to an element in the list, the function will return the index of that element, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.
- When the value is greater than all elements in the list, the function will return the total number of elements in the list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.
- When the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which is the correct insertion point.

The code's logic and the output hints agree with the problem description, handling all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case.
