Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and `i` is 1. If the element at index `i` in `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, the program returns 1. Otherwise, the program does not return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns None).***
