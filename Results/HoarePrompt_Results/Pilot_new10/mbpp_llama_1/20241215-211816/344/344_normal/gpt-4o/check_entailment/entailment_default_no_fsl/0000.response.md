Correctness: **True**

The code provides a function `func_1` that uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from Python's standard library to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is equivalent to the number of elements in the list that are strictly less than the given value.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including when the value is greater than all elements in the list, when the value is between elements in the list, and when the value is greater than the maximum element in the list.

The output hints also confirm that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list or a value outside the range of the list elements.

After examining the code and the provided examples, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is designed to handle these cases correctly, and the unit tests provide additional assurance of the function's correctness. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
