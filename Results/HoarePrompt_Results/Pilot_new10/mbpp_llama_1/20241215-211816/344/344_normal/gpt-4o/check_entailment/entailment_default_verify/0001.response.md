Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is None, which means there is no initial assessment to evaluate. However, we can assess the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the output hints.

The problem description asks for a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The provided code uses the `bisect` module, which is a built-in Python module for maintaining sorted lists. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements in the list that are strictly less than the given value.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct index for the given value. The hints also mention that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list or a value outside the range of the list elements.

After evaluating the code and the output hints, it appears that the program is correct. The `bisect_right` function is the correct function to use in this case, and the code is straightforward and easy to understand. The output hints provide evidence that the function behaves as expected, and the code handles edge cases correctly.

Final: **True** 

The reason for this assessment is that the code correctly implements the required functionality, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected. The use of the `bisect` module is also appropriate, as it is a built-in Python module designed for this purpose. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
