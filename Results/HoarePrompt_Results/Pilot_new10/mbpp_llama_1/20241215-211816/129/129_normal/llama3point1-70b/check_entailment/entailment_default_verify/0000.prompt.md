You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character. The `ord()` function in Python is specifically designed to return the Unicode code point for a one-character string, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value.

The function is designed to take a single character as input and returns an integer value representing the ASCII value of the character. This matches the problem description precisely. 

In every potential case, the function should work as expected because the `ord()` function can handle any character, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, punctuation marks, and whitespace characters, as long as the input is a single character. 

If the input were not a single character (e.g., a string of length greater than 1 or an empty string), the function might not behave as described or expected, but based on the provided problem description, it's assumed that the input will be a single character, and the function handles this case correctly. 

Therefore, without considering edge cases such as non-string inputs or strings of lengths other than 1 (which are not specified in the problem description), the function does what it's supposed to do according to the description provided.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string and returns the Unicode point for the first character of the string, raising a TypeError if the string is empty

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
