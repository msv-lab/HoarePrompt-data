Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The provided function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord` function, which returns the Unicode point for a given character. In the case of ASCII characters, the Unicode point is equivalent to the ASCII value.

The function's docstring accurately describes its purpose, parameters, and return value. The program's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and it handles the specified input (a single character) correctly.

It's worth noting that the problem description and the function's docstring use the term "ASCII value," while the `ord` function technically returns the Unicode point. However, for characters within the ASCII range (0-127), the Unicode point is identical to the ASCII value, so this distinction does not affect the correctness of the program.

The only potential issue is that the problem description does not specify what should happen if the input is not a single character. However, the annotated program's comment suggests that the input is always a single character, and the function behaves correctly under this assumption. If the input can be an empty string or a string of length greater than 1, additional error handling may be necessary to ensure the function behaves as expected in these cases. Nevertheless, based on the provided information, the program is correct.
