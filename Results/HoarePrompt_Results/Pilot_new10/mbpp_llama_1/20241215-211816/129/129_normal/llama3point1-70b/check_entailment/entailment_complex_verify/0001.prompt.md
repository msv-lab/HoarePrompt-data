You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct because it follows the problem description in every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function in Python. 

The `ord` function in Python returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, this function works correctly for all ASCII characters. 

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly handles both lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, punctuation, and special characters.

For example, if you call `func_1('a')`, it will return `97`, which is the ASCII value of 'a'. If you call `func_1('A')`, it will return `65`, which is the ASCII value of 'A'.

The only potential edge case is if the input is not a single character, but this is handled by the function's docstring which specifies that the input should be a single character. If the input is not a single character (e.g., a string of multiple characters or an empty string), the function may not behave as expected.

However, in terms of correctly implementing the problem description, the provided code correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character when the input is valid. 

To make the function more robust, you could add error checking to handle cases where the input is not a single character. However, based on the problem description provided, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a string of length 1, i.e., a single character.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode point for the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string and returns the Unicode point for the first character of the string, raising a TypeError if the string is empty

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
