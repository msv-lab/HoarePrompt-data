Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct because it follows the problem description in every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function in Python. 

The `ord` function in Python returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, this function works correctly for all ASCII characters. 

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly handles both lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, punctuation, and special characters.

For example, if you call `func_1('a')`, it will return `97`, which is the ASCII value of 'a'. If you call `func_1('A')`, it will return `65`, which is the ASCII value of 'A'.

The only potential edge case is if the input is not a single character, but this is handled by the function's docstring which specifies that the input should be a single character. If the input is not a single character (e.g., a string of multiple characters or an empty string), the function may not behave as expected.

However, in terms of correctly implementing the problem description, the provided code correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character when the input is valid. 

To make the function more robust, you could add error checking to handle cases where the input is not a single character. However, based on the problem description provided, the program is correct.
