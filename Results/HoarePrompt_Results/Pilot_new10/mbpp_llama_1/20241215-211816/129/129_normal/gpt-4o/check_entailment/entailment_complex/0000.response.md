Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the ASCII value of a character. In Python, the `ord()` function returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string, which is equivalent to the ASCII value for characters in the ASCII range.

The provided function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its Unicode value using the `ord()` function. The assertions provided also verify that the function behaves correctly for different input characters.

The only potential issue mentioned in the problem description and the annotations is that the function may throw an error if the input is not a single character or not a string at all. However, this is not a correctness issue, but rather a robustness issue. The problem description does not explicitly require the function to handle such cases, and in the context of the provided assertions, the function behaves correctly.

It's worth noting that the function will actually return the Unicode value, which is an extension of the ASCII value. For characters in the ASCII range (0-127), the Unicode value is the same as the ASCII value. For characters outside the ASCII range, the Unicode value will be different, but it's still a correct representation of the character's code point.

In summary, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and the `func_1` function correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character.
