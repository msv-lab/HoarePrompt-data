Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value. 

In Python, the `ord` function is used to get the Unicode point for a one-character string. For characters in the ASCII range (0-127), the Unicode point is equivalent to the ASCII value. Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of the input character.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function. The function returns the expected ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. 

In general, the program will work correctly for any single character input, as the `ord` function is designed to handle single character strings and return their Unicode points, which for ASCII characters, is the same as their ASCII values. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
