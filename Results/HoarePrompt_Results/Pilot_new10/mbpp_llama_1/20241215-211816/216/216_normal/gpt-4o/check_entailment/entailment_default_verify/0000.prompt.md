You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns False. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order.

Next, it iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns False. If it completes the iteration without finding such a pair, it returns True, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

This solution correctly handles the following cases:

* Empty list: Returns False
* List with non-consecutive numbers: Returns False
* List with duplicate numbers: Returns False (due to the sorting and the fact that the difference between identical numbers is 0, which is not 1)
* List with consecutive numbers: Returns True

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function is correctly implemented and handles all possible edge cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if the list is non-empty and contains consecutive integers in any order, or if the list contains a single element; it returns False for an empty list or a list where any two adjacent elements in sorted order are not consecutive

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
