According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst_sorted`. If `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `lst_sorted` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 3, which means `lst_sorted` must have at least 3 elements, and since `i` is now 2, `lst_sorted` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute one more time with `i` being 2 (since the loop condition checks `i` against `len(lst_sorted) - 1`).

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers equal to `lst` with at least 4 elements, `i` is 2**
