The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns `False` in Cases 1 through 4. In Case 5, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive integers and is equal to the original list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` if the list contains consecutive integers and is equal to the original list; otherwise, it returns `False` for all other cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers, returns `True` if the list contains consecutive integers and is equal to the original list; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
