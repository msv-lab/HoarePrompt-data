Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns False. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order.

Next, it iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns False. If it completes the iteration without finding such a pair, it returns True, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

This solution correctly handles the following cases:

* Empty list: Returns False
* List with non-consecutive numbers: Returns False
* List with duplicate numbers: Returns False (due to the sorting and the fact that the difference between identical numbers is 0, which is not 1)
* List with consecutive numbers: Returns True

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function is correctly implemented and handles all possible edge cases.
