Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers equal to `lst` with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in `lst_sorted` is not 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no specific changes are noted.**
