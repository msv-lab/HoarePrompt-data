Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should return True if the list contains a single element, but the code returns False for an empty list and does not explicitly handle the case where the list contains a single element. Although the provided unit tests suggest that the function should return False for an empty list, it does not agree with the problem description for a list containing a single element.

For instance, if we pass a list with a single element, such as `[5]`, the function should return True according to the problem description, but the code does not explicitly handle this case. 

The given code only checks if the list is not empty, sorts the list, and then checks if the numbers are consecutive. It does not have a special case for a list containing a single element.

However, the unit tests `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True` and `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False` passed, suggesting the code works for these test cases. But since there's no explicit test for a list with a single element, and given the provided problem description, the code should return True for such a list.

Upon closer inspection of the code, it actually works correctly for the list containing a single element because the for loop condition `for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):` is not met when the list contains a single element, so the function returns True as expected. But the unit test for this case is missing and the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case considering the way the problem description was written. The return statement for an empty list should be True or False depending on how one interprets "contains consecutive numbers". 

Since `func_1([5])` returns True as intended and the case where the list is empty was treated as returning False, it does not match the general problem description which could be interpreted as the list with a single element or no elements should return True, and lists with non-consecutive numbers should return False. The code behavior does not follow the provided description if we consider the case where the list has no elements or one element. However, based on the provided unit tests, the code was designed to return False for an empty list.

The function should either be updated to match the problem description or the problem description should be updated to match the function's behavior. In this case, the description seems to have a contradiction considering the provided unit tests. The function seems to treat the empty list and list with one element differently as indicated by `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True` and the absence of a test for an empty list or list with one element returning True. It seems that lists with a single element will indeed return True as the provided code will not enter the for loop when the list has one element. 

However, given the strict definition of Correctness and considering all the test cases and descriptions provided, including the missing explicit test case, but based on how one could interpret the given problem, it is more accurate to say the function was designed with the given unit tests in mind which treat the list with one element correctly but does not match one interpretation of the given description regarding the empty list. Thus it should be evaluated based on how one interprets "contains consecutive numbers". Therefore considering all descriptions and possible interpretations and given we are evaluating if the program does what the problem description says, for every potential case and possible interpretations of the given problem descriptions and provided unit tests, in the context provided the best response is still: 

Correctness: **False**

However, it can be argued that with the given unit tests the code does what the programmer intended, considering the given description could be interpreted in different ways, but given the problem description could be interpreted differently and the code does seem to work correctly based on provided unit tests for lists containing consecutive integers, but might not work for an empty list depending on the interpretation of "contains consecutive numbers" and adding a unit test for `func_1([5])` returns True, the conclusion of correctness could change. 

Therefore based strictly on interpretation, descriptions and all given information:

Correctness: **False** 

Considering the description given might not cover all edge cases, such as what the expected behavior for an empty list or a list containing a single element should be, however, for a list containing consecutive integers, the given code works as expected based on provided unit tests and the output hints agree with the code when lists contain consecutive numbers. 

Therefore given all possible considerations of the problem description and code: 

Correctness: **False** 

In case of further clarification of what the expected behavior should be for an empty list, or a list containing a single element the conclusion could change, however given all considerations of problem descriptions, unit tests, output hints and possible interpretations of what the function should do for every case the conclusion remains the same.
