Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first sorts the list in ascending order and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1, which is a condition for numbers to be consecutive. Additionally, it checks if all numbers in the list are unique by comparing the length of the original list with the length of a set created from the list. If the lengths are equal, it means all numbers are unique. 

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function returns True if the sorted list contains consecutive unique integers and False otherwise. The hints also cover various cases, including empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with non-consecutive or non-unique integers.

Upon examination, the code handles these cases correctly:

- For an empty list, `len(lst) == 0`, and the function will return False because an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.
- For a list with a single element, `len(lst) == 1`, the function will return True because a single number is considered consecutive.
- For lists with non-consecutive numbers, the `all` condition will fail to be True, causing the function to return False.
- For lists with non-unique numbers, the condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` will be False, causing the function to return False.

Given the analysis, the code appears to accurately implement the problem description for every potential case, making it correct.
