The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. The code first sorts the list in ascending order and then checks two conditions: 
1. If the difference between each pair of consecutive integers in the sorted list is 1, meaning the integers are consecutive. 
2. If the length of the sorted list is equal to the length of a set created from the list, meaning all integers in the list are unique.

The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that the list contains consecutive unique integers in ascending order. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, or a list with non-consecutive or non-unique integers by returning `False` in these cases.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, sorts it, and checks if the sorted list contains consecutive unique integers. It returns True if the list is sorted and contains consecutive unique integers, and False otherwise, including cases where the list is empty, contains a single element, or has non-consecutive or non-unique integers. **
