You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. `lst.sort()`: This line sorts the list in ascending order. This is necessary because the problem description does not specify that the input list must be sorted.

2. `all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))))`: This line checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the list is 1. This is the condition for numbers to be consecutive.

3. `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`: This line checks if all numbers in the list are unique. If there are any duplicate numbers, the lengths of the list and the set created from the list will be different.

The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`.

The `and` operator ensures that both conditions (consecutive numbers and uniqueness) must be met.

This function will correctly identify lists with consecutive numbers, such as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and will return `False` for lists with non-consecutive numbers or duplicates, such as [1, 2, 3, 5] or [1, 2, 2, 3].

For example, testing the function with the following inputs:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True`
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5])` returns `False`
- `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])` returns `False`

In all cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, sorts it, and checks if the sorted list contains consecutive unique integers. It returns True if the list is sorted and contains consecutive unique integers, and False otherwise, including cases where the list is empty, contains a single element, or has non-consecutive or non-unique integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
