The original assessment is mostly accurate, correctly identifying the function's behavior and the cases it handles correctly, including lists with negative numbers, lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers, and lists with duplicate numbers. The output hints provided also align with the original assessment, summarizing the function's behavior accurately.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the original assessment and the output hints overlook one crucial case: when the input list is empty. The function `func_1` will throw an error if the input list is empty because it attempts to access the first element (`lst[i - 1]`) when `i` is 1 in the `all` function, which would be outside the bounds of an empty list. Although the output hints mention the function's behavior for an empty list, suggesting it returns `False`, the function as written does not handle this case explicitly without raising an error.

Given the problem description and the provided code, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always be a non-empty list of integers, as stated in the instructions. Therefore, under the assumption that the user will always provide a valid input (a non-empty list), the original assessment that the program is correct remains accurate.

Final: **True**
