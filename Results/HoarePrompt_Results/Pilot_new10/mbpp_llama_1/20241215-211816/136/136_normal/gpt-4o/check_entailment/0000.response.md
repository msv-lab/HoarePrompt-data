Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty dictionaries: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with no values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with all values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return the original dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with a mix of values greater than, less than, and equal to `n`: The function will return a dictionary with only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, which is the expected result.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function returns the expected results. Therefore, the function is correct and meets the requirements described in the problem description.
