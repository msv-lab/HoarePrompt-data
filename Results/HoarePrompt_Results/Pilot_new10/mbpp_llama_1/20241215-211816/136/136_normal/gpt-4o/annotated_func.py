#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with integer values, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary that includes key-value pairs from dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. It assumes `d` contains only integer values and does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty dictionaries, non-integer values, negative or zero `n`, or `None` inputs, which may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
