The given program filters a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. Here's why it is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`.
2. The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates over each key-value pair in `d`.
3. For each pair, it checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. If this condition is true, the pair is included in the new dictionary.
4. The function returns this new dictionary, which contains only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

This behavior matches the problem description exactly. The program correctly filters the dictionary based on the specified condition.

Correctness: **True**
