Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. This is achieved through a dictionary comprehension that iterates over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary `d` and includes a pair in the output dictionary only if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, which matches the input requirements specified in the problem description.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The dictionary comprehension inside `func_1` checks each value `v` in the dictionary to see if it is greater than or equal to `n`. If the condition `v >= n` is met, the key-value pair is included in the resulting dictionary. This directly implements the filtering requirement specified in the problem description.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Dictionary**: If `d` is an empty dictionary, the dictionary comprehension will simply return an empty dictionary, as there are no key-value pairs to process. This behavior aligns with the expectation for handling empty inputs.
   - **Negative `n` Values**: The program correctly filters the dictionary based on the comparison `v >= n`, regardless of whether `n` is negative, zero, or positive. This means it handles negative `n` values as expected, including cases where `n` is less than the smallest possible value in the dictionary, resulting in all value pairs being included if their values are greater than or equal to `n`.

4. **Error Handling for Non-Comparable Values**: While the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle non-comparable values (e.g., if the dictionary contains values of different types, like strings and integers), the program will indeed raise an error if it attempts to compare values that are not comparable (e.g., comparing a string to an integer using `>=`). This behavior is reasonable, as the problem description assumes a comparison can be made, implying that values within the dictionary are of a comparable type.

Overall, the program correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement, handling the filtering of a dictionary based on a given threshold value `n` and addressing edge cases as would be reasonably expected.
