Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be mostly accurate. The function `func_1(d, n)` correctly filters the dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. It handles edge cases such as empty dictionaries and returns a new dictionary without modifying the original one.

The output hints provided confirm that the function works as described, handling cases where the dictionary is empty or `n` is negative. However, the output hints also mention that the function may raise an error if `d` contains non-comparable values. This could be considered a limitation of the function, but given the problem description does not explicitly mention handling non-comparable values, this does not necessarily make the function incorrect.

Given the assumptions made in the prompt that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the issue of non-comparable values is not directly relevant to the correctness of the function as described by the problem. The function performs its intended task based on the provided description and does so without explicit error checking for non-integer or non-dictionary inputs, which is within the scope of the assumptions provided.

Therefore, considering the assumptions about valid input and the primary focus on the task of filtering a dictionary based on a given condition, the original assessment of the function's correctness seems accurate.

Final: **True**
