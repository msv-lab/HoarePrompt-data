To solve this task, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We have a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`.
2. **Code Impact**: The code iterates over each key-value pair in dictionary `d` and checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to the integer `n`.
3. **Result Calculation**: For each key-value pair where `v >= n`, the pair is included in a new dictionary.
4. **Return Value**: The program returns this new dictionary, which contains key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given the initial state and the code's operation, we can describe the output state as follows:

Output State: **The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.**
