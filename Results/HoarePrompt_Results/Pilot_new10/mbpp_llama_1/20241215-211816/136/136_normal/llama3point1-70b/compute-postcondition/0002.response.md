To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze the given code and annotations step by step.

1. **Function Parameters and Return Type**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. It returns a dictionary.

2. **Functionality Description**: According to the annotations, the function returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The code implements this using a dictionary comprehension: `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}`.

3. **Analysis of Code and Annotations**: The code directly implements the functionality described in the annotations. It iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d` and includes the pair in the new dictionary if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that for any given dictionary and integer input, the function filters the dictionary based on the specified condition.

4. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
    - **Empty Dictionary**: If `d` is an empty dictionary, the function will return an empty dictionary because there are no key-value pairs to filter.
    - **Non-Integer Values**: If the dictionary contains non-integer values, the comparison `v >= n` will still work as expected in Python for most types that support comparison (like floats), but it might raise a TypeError if the values are of types that do not support comparison with integers (like strings, lists, etc.).
    - **Negative Values of `n`**: The function will return key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, even if `n` is negative. This is because the comparison is done based on the numeric value, regardless of whether `n` is positive, zero, or negative.
    - **Key Types**: The function does not restrict the types of keys in the dictionary. Therefore, it will work with dictionaries that have keys of any immutable type (since dictionary keys must be immutable).

5. **Conclusion**: The function `func_1` filters a given dictionary `d` based on a threshold value `n`, returning a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. It handles various edge cases, such as empty dictionaries and negative `n` values, but may raise a TypeError if the dictionary contains values of types that cannot be compared to integers.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, handling edge cases such as empty dictionaries and negative `n` values, but may raise an error if `d` contains non-comparable values. **
