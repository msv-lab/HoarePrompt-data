Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as input, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, as it specifies filtering the dictionary based on this condition.

The function utilizes a dictionary comprehension to efficiently create the new dictionary, ensuring it includes only the desired key-value pairs. It correctly handles edge cases such as empty dictionaries, as passing an empty dictionary will result in an empty dictionary being returned, which meets the problem's requirements. Additionally, it can handle negative `n` values, as these comparisons are valid and will yield the correct results.

However, the output hints mention that the function may raise an error if `d` contains non-comparable values. Although this could potentially be a consideration, the problem description does not specify what should happen in such cases. Given the code's behavior and the nature of the task, the assumption is that input dictionaries will contain comparable values (e.g., all numeric types).

Therefore, considering the code and the problem description, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases, assuming the input dictionary contains comparable values. This assessment aligns with the provided output hints and the overall functionality of the code.
