The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of elements that can be ordered and uses the functions `find_max_index` and `flip` to manipulate the list. 

Upon analyzing the code line by line, it appears that the function attempts to sort the list in descending order. However, the actual implementation details of `find_max_index` and `flip` are not provided, so we can only infer their functionality based on their usage.

The code iterates over the list from the last element to the second element, finds the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list, and swaps it with the last element of the unsorted part if necessary. This process is repeated until the list is sorted in descending order.

Potential edge cases to consider include:

- An empty list: The function would return an empty list without any errors.
- A list with a single element: The function would return the same list as it is already sorted.
- A list with duplicate elements: The function would return a list with the same elements but in descending order.

Missing logic includes:

- The function does not handle cases where the input list is not ordered or is not a list at all.
- The function does not handle cases where `find_max_index` or `flip` functions are not defined or accessible.

However, based on the code provided, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts an ordered list `arr` and returns the list in descending order by iteratively finding the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the last element of the unsorted part, handling edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements, but assuming that the input list is ordered and that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and accessible. **
