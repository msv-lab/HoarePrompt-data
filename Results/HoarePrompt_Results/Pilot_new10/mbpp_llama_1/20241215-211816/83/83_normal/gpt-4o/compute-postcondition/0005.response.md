According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and such that `1 < n <= len(arr)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and such that `2 < n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 2**
