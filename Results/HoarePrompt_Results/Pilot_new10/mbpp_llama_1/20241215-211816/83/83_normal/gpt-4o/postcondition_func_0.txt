The function accepts an ordered list `arr` and returns the list in descending order by iteratively finding the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the last element of the unsorted part, handling edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements, but assuming that the input list is ordered and that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and accessible.
