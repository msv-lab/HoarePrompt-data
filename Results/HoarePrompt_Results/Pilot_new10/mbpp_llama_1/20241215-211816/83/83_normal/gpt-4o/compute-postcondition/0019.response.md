The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements that can be ordered. After executing the function body, the function returns a list `arr` that contains elements in descending order. The original number of elements in `arr` is denoted as `n`, and the current size `curr_size` is 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an ordered list `arr` and return the list in descending order.
