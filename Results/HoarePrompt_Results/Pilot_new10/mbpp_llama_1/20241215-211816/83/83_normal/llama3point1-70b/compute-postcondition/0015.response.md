According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. If `size` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is 1 (since it's the last iteration of the loop that starts from `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1), `n` is greater than 0, `arr` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `size` must be decreased by 1. However, since we are looking at the state at the start of the next iteration, `size` should be one less than its current value. But in this case, since `size` is already at its minimum value of 1, the loop will not execute again if we only consider the decrement of `size`. 
But let's look at it from the perspective of the loop condition. The loop condition is `size` in `range(n, 0, -1)`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `size` should be the next value in the range, which would be `n-1` at the start of the first iteration, `n-2` at the start of the second iteration, and so on. Since `size` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to have executed the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time before the last iteration, `size` should be 2 (one more than its current value in the sequence of the loop). 
State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is 2**
