Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n-1`. If `max_index` is not the last index of the list excluding the last element, all elements except the last one are reversed and the index of the maximum value in the reversed part excluding the last element of `arr` needs to be recalculated. If `max_index` is the last index of the list excluding the last element, no changes are made to `arr`.***
