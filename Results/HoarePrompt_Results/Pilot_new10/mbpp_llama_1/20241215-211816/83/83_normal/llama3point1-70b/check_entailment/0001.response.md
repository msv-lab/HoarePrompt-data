Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The given function is attempting to sort a list of elements using a modified version of the selection sort algorithm. However, the implementation has a flaw.

A potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input list contains duplicate elements. The `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` line will always return the index of the first occurrence of the maximum element in the sublist, not necessarily the one that is closest to the end of the sublist. 

For example, if we call `func_1([3, 2, 3, 1])`, the function will not return the correct sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, because the `index` method will always find the first occurrence of the maximum element (which is 3 at index 0), not the one at index 2.

Another issue with this implementation is that it is not efficient for large lists. The `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` operation has a time complexity of O(n), and it is performed inside a loop that runs n times. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be slow for large lists.

A correct implementation of a sorting algorithm would need to handle these edge cases and have a more efficient time complexity.
