Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function to sort a list of elements, but it does not specify the order of sorting (either ascending or descending). However, the provided program sorts the list in descending order. 

The main issue with the program is that it does not meet the general definition of sorting, which typically implies sorting in ascending order unless otherwise specified. 

For example, if you have a list `[4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1]`, the program will return `[9, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1]`, which is sorted in descending order. However, a typical sorting function would return `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9]`, which is sorted in ascending order.

To fix this, the program should be modified to sort the list in ascending order, or the problem description should be updated to specify that the list should be sorted in descending order.

Here's an example of a corrected program in Python that sorts the list in ascending order:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

This function uses Python's built-in `sorted` function to sort the list in ascending order. If you want to sort the list in descending order, you can pass the `reverse=True` argument to the `sorted` function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
```
