Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated as the product of its length and width. The provided function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle.

The function is also designed to work with non-negative numbers, as stated in the problem description and the annotations. The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. 

The key insight here is that the area of a rectangle is always non-negative (or zero), and since the function is designed to take non-negative numbers as input, it will always produce the correct result. Additionally, the function does not contain any conditional statements that could potentially alter its behavior based on the sign of the input numbers. 

Therefore, based on the provided annotations and problem description, the function is correct and will always return the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
