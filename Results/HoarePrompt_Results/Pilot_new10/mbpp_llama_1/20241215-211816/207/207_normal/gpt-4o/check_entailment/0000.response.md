Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is a simple function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The formula used is the standard formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. 

The program handles all potential cases correctly because it correctly implements the formula for the area of a rectangle. There are no conditional statements or complex logic that could lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. The multiplication operation is correctly applied to all possible inputs of length and width.

The unit tests provided, `assert func_1(10, 20) == 200`, `assert func_1(10, 5) == 50`, and `assert func_1(4, 2) == 8`, demonstrate that the function works as expected for different inputs. There are no edge cases (like zero or negative numbers) that are not handled correctly, as the function will still produce the correct result (zero for a rectangle with zero length or width, and a negative number for a "rectangle" with a negative dimension, although in reality, a rectangle cannot have a negative dimension).

However, it's worth noting that in the real world, the dimensions of a rectangle cannot be negative, and the function does not check for this. But according to the mathematical formula, the function works correctly even for negative inputs, producing the correct result for the mathematical operation. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the function is correct.
