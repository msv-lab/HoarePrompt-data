Correctness: **False**

The code provided calculates the area of a rectangle correctly in most cases, but it does not account for the scenario when the input values for length and/or width are negative. The area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width, but both length and width must be positive or zero (in the case of a degenerate rectangle). 

If either the length or the width is negative, the function will return a negative value, which is incorrect for calculating the area of a rectangle. For example, `func_1(-10, 20)` will return `-200`, which is not a valid area for a rectangle.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it does not handle negative input values correctly. To fix this issue, the code should validate the input values to ensure they are either positive or zero before calculating the area. 

For instance, a corrected version of the function could be:

```python
def func_1(length, width):
    if length < 0 or width < 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be non-negative.")
    return length * width
```
