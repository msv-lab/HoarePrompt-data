To assess the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to find the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated as the product of its length and width.

2. **Program**:
   ```python
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
   ```
   This function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. This operation correctly calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

3. **Original Assessment**: None. Since there was no initial assessment, we will focus on evaluating the program directly against the problem description and the provided annotations.

4. **Annotated Version**:
   - The annotation states that the program returns the product of two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`, which aligns with the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.
   - It also mentions that the function will throw an error if either input is not a number, which, while not explicitly coded in the function, is a correct assumption given that the operation `length * width` will fail if either `length` or `width` is not a number.

Given these points, the program is mathematically correct for calculating the area of a rectangle. The annotations further clarify the expected behavior (returning the product of two numbers and implicitly requiring both inputs to be numbers).

However, it's worth noting that the program does not validate if the inputs are non-negative, as implied in the problem context where length and width should typically be positive (or at least non-negative) values. Yet, based on the strict format and the assumptions provided (valid input and no error handling required), we consider the mathematical operation itself as correct for the intended purpose.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations, considering we assume valid inputs and no requirement for error handling:

Final: **True**
