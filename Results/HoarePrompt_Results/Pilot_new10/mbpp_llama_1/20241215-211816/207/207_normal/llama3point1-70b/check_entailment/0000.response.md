Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width, which is the correct mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle. 

The function does not contain any conditional statements or loops that could potentially lead to incorrect results. It simply returns the product of the input length and width, which will always be the correct area of the rectangle.

This function will correctly handle all potential cases, including rectangles with integer and floating-point dimensions, as well as rectangles with zero or negative dimensions (although the latter may not be physically meaningful, the function will still return the correct mathematical result).

For example, `func_1(5, 3)` will return `15`, which is the correct area of a rectangle with length 5 and width 3. Similarly, `func_1(4.5, 2.8)` will return `12.6`, which is also correct. 

Therefore, the function meets the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
