The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. Looking at the code, it simply multiplies the `length` and `width` together and returns the result, without checking if the inputs are non-negative numbers as stated in the annotations. 

If either `length` or `width` is negative, the function will still return their product, which will be negative. If either `length` or `width` is zero, the function will return zero, because any number multiplied by zero is zero. 

There are no conditional statements or error checking in the code, so it does not handle potential edge cases such as non-numeric inputs. The code will throw an error if `length` or `width` is not a number.

So, the functionality of the function is to calculate and return the product of two numbers, `length` and `width`, regardless of whether they are non-negative or not.
