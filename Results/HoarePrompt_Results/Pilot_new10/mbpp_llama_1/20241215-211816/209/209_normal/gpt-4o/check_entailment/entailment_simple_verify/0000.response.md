The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I agree with this assessment. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist, which aligns with the problem description. The list comprehension used in the function is straightforward and correctly extracts the first element from each sublist.

The annotated version of the code also supports this conclusion, as it confirms that the program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `lst`. The state of the program before the function call is a list of lists, which is the expected input.

Since the program behaves as expected for all valid inputs, and the annotations confirm the correctness of the function, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
