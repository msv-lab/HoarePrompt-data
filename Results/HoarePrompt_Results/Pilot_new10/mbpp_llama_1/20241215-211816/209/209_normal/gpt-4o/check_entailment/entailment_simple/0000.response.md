Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python function to get the first element of each sublist. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The function takes a list of lists (`lst`) as input.
- It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `lst`.
- For each sublist, it selects the first element (`sublist[0]`) and adds it to the output list.
- The function returns this output list, which contains the first element of each sublist.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function:

- `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]`: The function correctly identifies the first elements of each sublist.
- `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]`: The function works correctly even when the sublists have different lengths.
- `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]`: The function still works correctly regardless of the actual values in the sublists.

Therefore, the program always follows the problem description, making it correct. 

However, it's worth noting that this function does not handle the case where the input list is empty or where one of the sublists is empty. If such cases are expected, additional error handling would be necessary. For example:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst or any(not sublist for sublist in lst):
        raise ValueError("Input list or sublists cannot be empty")
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

But based on the provided problem description and unit tests, the original function appears to be correct.
