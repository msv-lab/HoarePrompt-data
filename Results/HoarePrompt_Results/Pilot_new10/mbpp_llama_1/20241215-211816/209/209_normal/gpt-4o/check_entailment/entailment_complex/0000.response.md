Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. The provided function `func_1` takes a list of lists `lst` as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `lst` and extracts the first element using `sublist[0]`.

The function handles the following cases correctly:

1.  **List of lists with non-empty sublists**: It returns a list containing the first element of each sublist.
2.  **Empty list**: If the input list `lst` is empty, the function returns an empty list because the list comprehension will not iterate over any sublists.

However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input list contains non-list items or empty sublists, as mentioned in the annotations. In Python, attempting to access the first element of a non-list item using `sublist[0]` will result in an error if the item is not indexable. Similarly, trying to access the first element of an empty sublist will result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception.

Despite this, the function's behavior aligns with the problem description for the specific task of getting the first element of each sublist, assuming that the input list contains only non-empty lists. To fully align with the annotations and ensure robustness, additional error checking could be added to handle edge cases.

Here's an updated version of the function with error checking:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    """
    Returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in lst.
    
    Args:
    lst (list): A list of lists.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list containing the first element of each sublist.
    
    Raises:
    ValueError: If lst contains non-list items or empty sublists.
    """
    if not all(isinstance(sublist, list) for sublist in lst):
        raise ValueError("Input list contains non-list items")
    if any(len(sublist) == 0 for sublist in lst):
        raise ValueError("Input list contains empty sublists")
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```
This updated version includes error checking to ensure that the input list contains only non-empty lists and raises informative errors if the input is invalid.
