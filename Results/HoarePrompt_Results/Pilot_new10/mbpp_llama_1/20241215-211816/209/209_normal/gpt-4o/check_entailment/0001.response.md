Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and extracts the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`.

The function handles lists of varying lengths and structures, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. For example, it correctly handles sublists with different numbers of elements, as seen in the test case `assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]`.

Additionally, the function will work correctly for edge cases, such as an empty list `[]` (although this is not explicitly tested) or a list containing only one sublist, e.g., `[[1, 2, 3]]`. In the case of an empty list, the function will return an empty list `[]`, which is the expected behavior.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and will work as expected for all potential inputs.
