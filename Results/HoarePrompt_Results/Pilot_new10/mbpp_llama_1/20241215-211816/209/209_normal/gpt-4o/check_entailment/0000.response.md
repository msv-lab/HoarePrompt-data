Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lst`) as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in `lst` and extracts the first element using `sublist[0]`.

The function appears to be correct for all potential cases. It handles lists of varying lengths, including empty lists, and sublists of different sizes. The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate the function's ability to extract the first elements from sublists with different numbers of elements.

Additionally, the function does not contain any logic that could potentially lead to incorrect results. The list comprehension is straightforward and does not rely on any conditional statements or loops that could introduce errors. The function simply returns a list of the first elements of each sublist, which aligns with the problem description.

Overall, since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the function is correct.
