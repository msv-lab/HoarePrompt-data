Correctness: **False**

The given Python function `func_1` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, it does not throw an error when `lst` contains non-list items or empty sublists. According to the output hints, the function should throw an error in such cases, but the provided code does not include any error checking or handling for these scenarios. 

For example, if `lst` is `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`, the function will return `[1, 3]` without throwing an error, which does not match the expected behavior described in the output hints. Similarly, if `lst` contains non-list items, such as `[[1, 2], 'hello', [3, 4]]`, the function will throw a TypeError, but this is not the expected behavior as described in the output hints, which suggests that it should be explicitly checking for and handling these cases.

To correctly implement the function according to the problem description and output hints, additional error checking and handling would be necessary to ensure that the function behaves as expected for all potential inputs.
