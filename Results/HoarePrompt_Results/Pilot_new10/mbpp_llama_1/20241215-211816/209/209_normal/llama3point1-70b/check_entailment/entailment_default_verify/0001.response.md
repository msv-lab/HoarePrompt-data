The original assessment states that the provided program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty, which would raise an `IndexError`. However, the output hints indicate that the function raises an exception if the input list contains empty sublists or non-list elements. This matches the behavior of the original program, which would indeed raise an exception if it encounters an empty sublist.

Given this information, the original assessment was actually incorrect in its criticism of the program's handling of empty sublists. The program's behavior aligns with the expected behavior as described by the output hints. The output hints specify that the function raises an exception if the input list contains empty sublists, which is exactly what the program does.

The original assessment suggested modifying the function to handle empty sublists by returning `None` for them, but this does not align with the specified behavior in the output hints. Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, as per the instructions, and given the output hints that indicate the function should raise an exception for empty sublists, the program behaves as expected.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code and output hints, the program is correct in its implementation as per the constraints and expected behavior described.

Final: **True**
