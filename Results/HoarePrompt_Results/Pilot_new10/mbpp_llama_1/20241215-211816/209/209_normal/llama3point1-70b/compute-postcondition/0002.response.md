The function func_1 accepts a parameter sublists, which is a list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the first element of each sublist in 'sublists'. 

However, the function does not handle potential edge cases such as an empty list, a list containing empty sublists, or a list containing non-list elements.

If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains empty sublists, the function will raise an IndexError when trying to access the first element of an empty sublist. If the input list contains non-list elements, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to access the first element of a non-list element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in 'sublists', or to raise an exception if the input list contains empty sublists or non-list elements.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists and returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist; it returns an empty list if the input list is empty, and raises an exception if the input list contains empty sublists or non-list elements. **
