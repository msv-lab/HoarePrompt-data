To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state. The initial state is that `sublists` is a list of lists. The code provided is a list comprehension that iterates over each `sublist` in `sublists` and returns the first element of each `sublist`.

Given that `sublists` is a list of lists, when the code `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` is executed, it creates a new list containing the first element of each sublist found in `sublists`.

Therefore, the program returns a list of elements where each element is the first item of a sublist in `sublists`.

Output State: **The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in 'sublists'.**
