The code provided is a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and sorts the strings within each sublist. 

Given the initial state, we know `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. 

The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but in sorted order.

Output State: **The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings in sorted order, with the same sublists structure as the original `list_of_lists`.**
