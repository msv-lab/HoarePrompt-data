Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `sorted` function is used to sort the strings in each sublist. 

The program works correctly because it correctly sorts the strings in each sublist. The `sorted` function in Python is case-sensitive, so it treats uppercase letters as coming before lowercase letters. However, this is the expected behavior according to the unit tests provided.

For example, in the first unit test, `['green', 'orange']` is not changed because 'g' comes before 'o', `['black', 'white']` is not changed because 'b' comes before 'w', and `['white', 'black', 'orange']` is sorted to `['black', 'orange', 'white']` because 'b' comes before 'o' which comes before 'w'.

The program does not remove any leading or trailing spaces from the strings, which is also consistent with the unit tests provided.

Overall, the program works as expected and correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
