The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings in sorted order, with the same sublists structure as the original `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of lists of strings and return the same list structure with all sublists containing their strings in sorted order.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists of strings and returns the same list structure with all sublists containing their strings in sorted order.**
