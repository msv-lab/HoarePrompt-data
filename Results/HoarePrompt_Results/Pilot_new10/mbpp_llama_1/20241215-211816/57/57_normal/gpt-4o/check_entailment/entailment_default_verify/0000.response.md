The original assessment is **True** because the provided Python function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in ascending alphabetical order. The function uses a list comprehension with the built-in `sorted` function, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The output hints also confirm this behavior, stating that the function sorts each sublist in ascending order and returns the sorted list of lists. 

However, the output hints do mention that the function assumes the input structure is correct and does not handle invalid or nested structures beyond the first level, potentially raising errors for non-comparable elements, null inputs, or if the input is not a list of lists. But since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the function is correct for all potential valid cases, and the Correctness is **True**.

Final: **True**
