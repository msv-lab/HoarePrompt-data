The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner. The annotated version of the code also supports this conclusion, as it describes the function's behavior as returning a list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order.

The original assessment provides several test cases to verify the correctness of the function, and all of these test cases produce the expected output. The annotated version of the code also confirms that the function behaves as expected.

One potential issue that could be raised is that the function does not check if the input is a list of lists containing only strings. However, as per the problem description, it is assumed that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this is not considered a problem in this case.

In conclusion, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner, and the provided test cases confirm this.

Final: **True**
