Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive alphabetical order. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists, and the built-in `sorted` function to sort the strings in each sublist. The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

For every potential case, the code will work as expected. It will handle lists of lists containing any number of strings, and will correctly sort each sublist regardless of the length of the strings or the case used. It will also handle empty sublists and empty lists, returning an empty list of lists or a list of empty lists, respectively.

The output hints provided agree with the code, and no potential edge cases were found where the code would not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case, and the correctness is **True**.
