Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function with a `key` argument set to `str.lower`, which ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

This function should work correctly for all potential cases because it handles the following scenarios:

- **Empty sublists**: The `sorted` function will return an empty list when applied to an empty sublist, which is the expected result.
- **Sublists with a single element**: The `sorted` function will return the sublist itself when applied to a sublist with a single element, which is the expected result since a list with one element is already sorted.
- **Sublists with duplicate elements**: The `sorted` function is stable, meaning that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is preserved.
- **Sublists with strings containing non-alphabet characters**: The `str.lower` method works correctly with strings containing non-alphabet characters.
- **Sublists with different lengths**: The list comprehension will handle sublists of varying lengths correctly.

Since the function handles these edge cases and sorts the sublists as expected, it is correct according to the provided problem description.
