According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of `lst`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `lst` has at least 1 integer, and either `i` is even or `lst[i]` is odd (or both). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `i` is now odd, the condition that `i` is odd and `lst[i]` is even is still a possibility, but it's not a requirement for the loop to continue. The requirement is that `i` is less than the length of `lst`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least 2 integers.
State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
