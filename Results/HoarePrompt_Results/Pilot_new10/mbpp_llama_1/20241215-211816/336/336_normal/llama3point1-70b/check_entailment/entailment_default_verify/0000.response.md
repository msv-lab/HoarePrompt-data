To determine the correctness of the program, let's first analyze the problem description and the provided code. The problem description asks for a function that checks whether every odd index of a given list contains odd numbers. The code provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2!= 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function iterates through the list using the index `i`. If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

The output hints suggest that the function accepts a list of integers and returns `True` if no odd-indexed elements have even values, and `False` otherwise. This description matches the behavior of the provided code.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is "None", implying there was no initial assessment. The output hints, however, provide insight into the code's functionality, suggesting it covers all potential edge cases, including empty lists and lists of varying lengths and compositions.

The key point to verify is whether the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It does so by checking each odd index of the list to ensure it contains an odd number. If any odd index contains an even number, the function correctly returns `False`. The function also correctly handles the case where it doesn't find any such instances by returning `True`.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment (being "None") does not offer an opinion on the correctness. However, the provided code does indeed match the problem description's requirements, and the output hints support this conclusion.

The reason for changing the original assessment from "None" to an affirmative correctness assessment is that the code aligns with the problem description's requirements, and the output hints provide confidence in the code's functionality across different scenarios.

Final: **True**
