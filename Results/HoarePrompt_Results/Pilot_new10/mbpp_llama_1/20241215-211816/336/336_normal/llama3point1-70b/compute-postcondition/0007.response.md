According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of `lst`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `lst` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Since the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst`, `lst` must have at least 3 integers for the loop to execute again.
State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `i` is 2**
