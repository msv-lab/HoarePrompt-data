According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst`. If `lst` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `lst` is a list of integers, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `lst` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is 0, because the range function starts from 0.
State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
