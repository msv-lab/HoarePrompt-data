To determine the correctness of the program, we need to assess whether it accurately checks if every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.

The original assessment was `None`, indicating that no initial judgment was made about the program's correctness.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates over a list `lst`. It checks each index `i` to see if it's odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and if the value at that index in the list is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If such a condition is found, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any even numbers at odd indexes, it returns `True`.

The annotated version of the code supports this logic, noting that after the loop, if the function hasn't returned `False`, it means no odd index had an even value, and thus it returns `True`.

Given this, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number. It accurately assesses the list based on the specified condition and returns the appropriate boolean value.

Therefore, the reason for believing the program is correct is that it iterates through the list, checks the condition specified (odd indexes containing odd numbers), and returns the expected boolean value based on whether this condition is met across all odd indexes.

Final: **True**
