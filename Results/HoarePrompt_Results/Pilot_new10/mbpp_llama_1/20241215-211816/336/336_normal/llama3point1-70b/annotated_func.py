#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(lst) - 1` if `lst` is not empty, and the function did not return `False` due to an odd index with an even value in `lst`. If `lst` is empty, `i` remains as initialized before the loop, which is not specified in the given context.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if no odd-indexed elements in the list have even values; otherwise, it returns False, covering all potential edge cases including empty lists and lists of varying lengths and compositions.
