Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list using the index `i`, and for each index, it checks two conditions: 
1. If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`).
2. If the value at the index `i` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

If both conditions are met (i.e., an odd index contains an even number), the function immediately returns `False`. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding any such case, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs for which the function would fail to work as described. The function correctly handles lists of any length, including empty lists (though the function would return `True` for an empty list, as there are no odd indices to check), and it correctly identifies whether odd indices contain odd numbers. Therefore, the function is correct according to the provided problem description.
