Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0. Given that `i` equals 0, the current value of `i` is even, however since `i` must be odd to satisfy the condition `i % 2!= 0`, this condition cannot be satisfied with `i` being 0. Since the if condition requires `i` to be odd and `lst[i]` to be even, and it is known that `i` is initially 0, it seems there is a contradiction because `i` cannot be odd if it is 0. Considering the initial condition that `i` is 0, and assuming there might be an oversight in the interpretation due to the strict format of the if condition, we should technically state the condition as is: `i` is initially 0, but to satisfy the given if condition, `i` would need to be an odd number and `lst[i]` would need to be an even number. However, strictly following the initial condition that `i` equals 0 and the list must have at least one integer, and since `i` cannot satisfy `i % 2!= 0` when `i` is 0, we must acknowledge this discrepancy. The if condition specifies a relationship that cannot be directly applied given the initial conditions without further context or assumption about how `i` or `lst` might change. Yet, according to the task, the postcondition should reflect both the initial state and the condition to enter the if statement. Thus, accurately, we must state that the program's postcondition, based on given preconditions and the if condition, presents a scenario where the initial condition (`i` equals 0) seems incompatible with the requirement for `i` to be odd. Nonetheless, to fulfill the task format: `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` initially is 0, and for the if condition to be true, it requires an odd `i` and an even `lst[i]`, which under given initial conditions (`i` equals 0), poses a logical inconsistency because `i` cannot be odd and even simultaneously.**
