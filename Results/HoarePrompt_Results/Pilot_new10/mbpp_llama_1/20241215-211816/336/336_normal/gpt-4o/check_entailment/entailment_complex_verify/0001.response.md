The original assessment is "None", which indicates that no initial evaluation of the program's correctness was provided.

After reviewing the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, it appears that the program is correct. The function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the program's state at different points, which confirms that the function behaves as expected.

The function iterates over the list with a step of 2, starting from index 1 (which is the first odd index), and checks if the element at each odd index is odd. If it encounters an even element at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even elements at odd indices, it returns `True`.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program. The test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with odd and even elements at odd indices, and lists with less than two elements.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment should be updated to indicate that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
