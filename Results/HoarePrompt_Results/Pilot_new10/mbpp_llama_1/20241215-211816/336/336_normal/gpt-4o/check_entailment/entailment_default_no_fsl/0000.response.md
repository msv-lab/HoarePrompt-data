Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. It does this by iterating over the list, starting from the second element (at index 1), and checking every other element. If it encounters an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding an even number, it returns `True`.

The code handles edge cases correctly, such as lists with less than two elements, in which case it will return `True` because there are no odd indices to check.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the code, covering different scenarios, including lists with both odd and even numbers at odd indices, and lists with fewer than two elements. 

For example, the test `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` passes because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 7) are odd. The test `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` also passes because the element at the odd index 1 is even. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the required functionality, and there are no cases where it does not work as expected according to the problem description.
