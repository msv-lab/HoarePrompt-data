Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. Here's why:

- The function iterates over the list using a for loop with a step of 2, starting from index 1. This ensures that it only considers the odd indexes of the list.
- For each odd index `i`, it checks if the number at that index `lst[i]` is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If `lst[i] % 2 == 0`, it means the number is even, and the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indexes, the function returns `True`, indicating that every odd index in the list contains an odd number.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function:

- The first test `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` passes because the numbers at odd indexes (1, 3, 7, 3) are all odd.
- The second test `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` passes because the number at the odd index (1) is odd.
- The third test `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` passes because the number at the odd index (2) is even, so the function correctly returns `False`.

After analyzing the code and the provided tests, it appears that the function works as expected for all potential cases, and no counterexamples can be found where the program does not work correctly according to the given problem description.
