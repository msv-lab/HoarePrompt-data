The original assessment is None, which implies that the correctness of the program was not evaluated. To determine the final correctness of the program, we need to analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints.

The problem description requires writing a Python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates over the list at odd indices (1, 3, 5,...) and checks if the elements at these indices are odd. If it encounters an even element at an odd index, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The output hints suggest that the function returns `True` if all elements at odd indices are odd or if the list has less than two elements. This aligns with the provided code, as it only checks the elements at odd indices and does not handle the case where the list has less than two elements as a special case. The code will correctly return `True` for lists with less than two elements because the loop will not be executed.

Based on the analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the required functionality. The output hints also match the behavior of the code. Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
