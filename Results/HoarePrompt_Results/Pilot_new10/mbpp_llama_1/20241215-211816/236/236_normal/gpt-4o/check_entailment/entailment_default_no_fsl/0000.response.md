Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order or not. It iterates over each element in the list and compares it with the next element. If it finds a pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it successfully iterates over the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The function handles lists with fewer than two elements correctly, as it will not enter the loop in such cases and will return `True` by default. The output hints also mention that the function does not handle lists with non-comparable elements, which may result in a `TypeError`. However, this is not a contradiction to the problem description, as the problem description does not explicitly require the function to handle non-comparable elements.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for both sorted and unsorted lists. Additionally, the function's implementation is straightforward and easy to understand, making it less prone to errors.

Overall, based on the provided code and output hints, it appears that the function correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order or not, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
