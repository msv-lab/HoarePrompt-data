The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value based on certain conditions. However, the conditions for returning False in Case_1, Case_2, and Case_3 are not specified, and only Case_4 returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and return a boolean value based on the conditions met by `lst`, with True being returned under specific circumstances and False otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns a boolean value based on the conditions met by `lst`.**
