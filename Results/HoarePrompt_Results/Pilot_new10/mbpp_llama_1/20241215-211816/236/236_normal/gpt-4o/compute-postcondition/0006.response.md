Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1. If the element at index `i` in `lst` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the condition that the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1` still holds, as no changes were made in the else part.***
