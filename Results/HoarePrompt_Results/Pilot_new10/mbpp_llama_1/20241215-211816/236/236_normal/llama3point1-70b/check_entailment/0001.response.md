Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the problem description. It checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the original list with a sorted version of itself. The `sorted()` function returns a new list containing all items from the original list in ascending order. If the two lists are equal, it means the original list was already sorted.

The program works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the program correctly returns `True`.
- Lists with a single element: A list with a single element is considered sorted, and the program correctly returns `True`.
- Already sorted lists: The program correctly returns `True` for lists that are already in ascending order.
- Unsorted lists: The program correctly returns `False` for lists that are not in ascending order.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The program correctly handles lists with duplicate elements.
- Lists with negative numbers: The program correctly handles lists with negative numbers.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling. Therefore, it is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
