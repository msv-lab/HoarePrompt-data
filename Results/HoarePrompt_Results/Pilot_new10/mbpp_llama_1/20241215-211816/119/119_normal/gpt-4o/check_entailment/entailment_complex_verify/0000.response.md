The original assessment is "None", indicating that there was no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. 

Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The annotated code confirms this, as it explains that the function accepts two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order, i.e., `b` and `a`, without performing any operations or checks on the inputs.

Upon reviewing the provided code, it appears to correctly implement the described functionality. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns them as a tuple in the order `(b, a)`, which matches the problem description.

The annotated version of the code also supports this conclusion, stating that the function returns `b` and `a`, which are numbers, and that the function accepts two numbers and returns them in reverse order.

Given this information, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
