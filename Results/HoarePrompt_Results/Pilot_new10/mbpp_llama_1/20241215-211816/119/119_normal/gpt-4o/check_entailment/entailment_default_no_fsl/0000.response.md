Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with `b` followed by `a`, which is exactly what the problem asks for. The provided unit tests `assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, and `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)` also validate this behavior, showing that the function works as expected for different input values.

There are no indications in the problem description or the output hints that suggest the function should perform any additional operations or input checks. The function simply swaps the order of the input numbers, and it does so correctly for all the provided test cases. Without any further constraints or requirements, the function meets the specified requirements. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case as described.
