Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1(a, b)` simply takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order as a tuple, with `b` first and `a` second. This directly follows the problem description, which asks to write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.

The code does not include any conditional statements or modifications that could potentially cause it to behave differently for certain inputs. It consistently returns the tuple `(b, a)` for any two input numbers `a` and `b`. The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns the numbers in reverse order without any conditions or modifications.

Since the code directly and consistently implements the behavior described in the problem description, and there are no observable conditions under which the code would fail to meet this description, it is considered correct for every potential case.
