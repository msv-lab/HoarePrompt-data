Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as input and returns them as a tuple in reverse order, with the second number `b` first and the first number `a` second. This is exactly as specified in the problem description. The function does not impose any conditions or modifications on the input numbers, making it work for every potential case as described. The output hints also confirm this behavior, indicating that the function accepts two numbers and returns them in reverse order without any exceptions or special handling. Since the function behaves as specified for all possible inputs, it is considered correct.
