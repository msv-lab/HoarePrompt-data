Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` as the first element and `a` as the second element. This behavior exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number first and then the first number.

To verify the correctness, let's consider various potential cases:

1. **Positive numbers**: If we call `func_1(10, 20)`, the function returns `(20, 10)`, which matches the problem description.
2. **Negative numbers**: If we call `func_1(-10, -20)`, the function returns `(-20, -10)`, which is correct.
3. **Zero and positive numbers**: If we call `func_1(0, 20)`, the function returns `(20, 0)`, which matches the problem description.
4. **Zero and negative numbers**: If we call `func_1(-10, 0)`, the function returns `(0, -10)`, which is correct.

In all the cases we can think of, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Since we cannot think of a single case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.
