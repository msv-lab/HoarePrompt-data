The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. The original program `def func_1(a, b): return (b, a)` matches this description. 

The annotated version of the code also aligns with the problem description. Before the function call, `a` and `b` are numbers, and the function returns `b` and `a`, which is consistent with the problem description.

However, it's worth noting that the annotated version of the code has a slight discrepancy in its comments. The comment `return b, a` should ideally be `return (b, a)` to highlight that a tuple is being returned, as stated in the problem description.

Despite this minor discrepancy, the program itself correctly implements the desired functionality. Therefore, the original assessment of "None" essentially lacks a verdict on the program's correctness. Given the program and its annotated version align with the problem description, the final assessment is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
