To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to determine if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number first and then the first number.

The provided function, `func_1(a, b)`, is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
```

This function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. In Python, when you use a comma to separate values in a return statement, it implicitly creates a tuple.

Here's why this function meets the problem description:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numbers according to the problem description. The function does not enforce that these must be numbers, but based on the description, it's implied that `a` and `b` should be numeric.

2. **Return Type**: The function is supposed to return a tuple. The return statement `return b, a` indeed returns a tuple, which aligns with the requirement.

3. **Order of Elements in the Tuple**: The problem description specifies that the second number (`b`) should be returned first, followed by the first number (`a`). The function's return statement `return b, a` correctly places `b` before `a` in the tuple.

Given these points, the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement. It takes two numbers, and returns them in a tuple with the second number first.

Correctness: **True**
