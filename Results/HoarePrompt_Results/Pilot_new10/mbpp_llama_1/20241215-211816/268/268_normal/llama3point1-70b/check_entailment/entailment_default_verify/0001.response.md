Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be overly cautious. The problem description does not explicitly state that the function should handle edge cases such as an empty matrix, a column index out of range, or rows with different lengths. It only asks for a function that returns the max of the n'th column.

The output hints also suggest that the input will be valid, and the function should work correctly for a 2D list of integers and a non-negative integer n. The hints also mention that if n is equal to the number of columns in matrix, it raises an IndexError, which is the expected behavior for Python's list indexing.

The original assessment is not accurate because it assumes that the function should handle edge cases that are not mentioned in the problem description. The function is designed to work with valid inputs, and it does so correctly.

The reason why the original assessment is not accurate is that it is based on the assumption that the function should be robust and handle all possible edge cases, which is not necessarily the case. The problem description only asks for a function that works correctly for a given matrix and column index, without specifying any error handling requirements.

Final: **True**
