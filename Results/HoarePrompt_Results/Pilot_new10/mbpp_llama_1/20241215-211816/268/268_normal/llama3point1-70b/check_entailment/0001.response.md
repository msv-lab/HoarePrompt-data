Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the input matrix is empty or when the column index `n` is out of range. 

For example, if we call `func_1([], 1)`, the program will throw an error because it cannot iterate over an empty list. Similarly, if we call `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 3)`, the program will also throw an error because the column index `3` is out of range (since list indices in Python start from 0).

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the matrix rows have different lengths. For example, if we call `func_1([[1, 2], [3]], 2)`, the program will throw an error when it tries to access the second element of the second row, which does not exist.

To make the program correct, it should include error checking to handle these edge cases. 

Here is an example of what the error checking might look like:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    if not matrix:
        raise ValueError("Matrix is empty")
    if n < 1 or n > len(matrix[0]):
        raise ValueError("Column index is out of range")
    if not all(len(row) == len(matrix[0]) for row in matrix):
        raise ValueError("Rows have different lengths")
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```
