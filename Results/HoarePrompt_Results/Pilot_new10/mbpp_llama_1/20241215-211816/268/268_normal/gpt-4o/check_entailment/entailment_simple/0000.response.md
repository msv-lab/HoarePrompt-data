Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description because it correctly returns the maximum value of the nth column in the given matrix.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n` as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to extract the nth column from the matrix, which is stored in the `nth_column` list. This is done by iterating over each row in the matrix and selecting the element at index `n` from each row.
3. It then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the `nth_column` list.
4. The maximum value is returned as the result.

The program handles all potential cases because:

* It assumes that the input matrix is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the matrix.
* It assumes that the input `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, which means that `n` is a valid column index for the matrix.
* The list comprehension and `max` function are used correctly to extract and find the maximum value of the nth column, respectively.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the program works correctly for different inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
