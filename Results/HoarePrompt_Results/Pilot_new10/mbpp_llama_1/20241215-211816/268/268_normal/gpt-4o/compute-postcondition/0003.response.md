The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n` as parameters. 

Looking at the code, we see that it first extracts the elements at index `n` from each row of the `matrix` using a list comprehension and stores them in `nth_column`. Then, it returns the maximum value from `nth_column`.

However, we must consider potential edge cases and missing logic. 

- If the `matrix` is empty, `nth_column` will also be empty, and `max(nth_column)` will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot find the maximum value of an empty sequence.
- If `n` is out of range (i.e., `n` is greater than or equal to `len(matrix[0])`), an `IndexError` will occur when trying to access `row[n]`.
- The function does not handle cases where the `matrix` contains non-comparable elements (e.g., strings and integers). In such cases, the `max` function may raise a `TypeError`.

Given these considerations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the elements at index `n` in each row of `matrix`, provided that `matrix` is not empty, `n` is a valid index, and all elements at index `n` are comparable; otherwise, it may raise a `ValueError` for an empty `matrix`, an `IndexError` for an out-of-range `n`, or a `TypeError` for non-comparable elements. **
