Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum value in the `n`-th column of the matrix.

The function uses a list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the matrix, and then returns the maximum value in this column using the built-in `max` function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. Additionally, the function does not contain any obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail. For example, it does not assume that the matrix is square, or that the columns are all the same length.

The function also handles the case where `n` is a valid index for the columns in the matrix. However, it does not include error checking to handle the case where `n` is out of range. But based on the problem description, it seems that `n` is assumed to be a valid index.

In general, the function seems to be a straightforward and efficient implementation of the problem description, and it passes all the provided unit tests. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

One potential edge case to consider is when the input matrix is empty, or when `n` is out of range. In these cases, the function may raise an exception or return incorrect results. For example, if the input matrix is `[]` and `n` is `0`, the function will raise an `IndexError`. To make the function more robust, you could add error checking to handle these edge cases. However, based on the problem description, it seems that these cases are not considered, so the function is correct as is. 

To handle these edge cases, you could modify the function as follows:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    if not matrix or n < 0 or n >= len(matrix[0]):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
```
This modified function raises a `ValueError` if the input matrix is empty, or if `n` is out of range. This makes the function more robust and able to handle a wider range of inputs.
