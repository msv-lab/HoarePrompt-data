You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function, `func_1`, appears to be correct for finding the maximum value in the nth column of a given matrix. Here's why:

1. The function uses list comprehension to extract the nth column from the matrix: `[row[n] for row in matrix]`. This is a Pythonic and efficient way to achieve this.

2. It then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the extracted column.

3. The function assumes that the input matrix is a list of lists and that all inner lists have at least `n+1` elements (since list indices in Python are 0-based). If these assumptions are met, the function should work correctly for all valid inputs.

4. The unit tests provided also suggest that the function behaves as expected.

Since the code is simple and directly addresses the problem statement, and no edge cases or potential errors could be found, the code is considered correct. It correctly handles the task of finding the maximum value in a specified column of a matrix, as described in the problem statement. 

However, it is worth noting that the function does not include any error checking to handle potential edge cases, such as:
- An empty matrix.
- A matrix with rows of different lengths.
- A column index that is out of range.
- A non-integer column index.
- A non-list input.

If the function is intended to handle these cases, additional code would be needed to add error checking and handling. But based solely on the problem description and provided code, the function appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the elements at index `n` in each row of `matrix`, provided that `matrix` is not empty, `n` is a valid index, and all elements at index `n` are comparable; otherwise, it may raise a `ValueError` for an empty `matrix`, an `IndexError` for an out-of-range `n`, or a `TypeError` for non-comparable elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
