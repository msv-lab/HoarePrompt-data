The problem description requires a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an input `degrees` and returns the result of multiplying `degrees` by `math.pi / 180`, which is the correct conversion formula from degrees to radians.

The original assessment is `None`, indicating that no initial evaluation was made.

The annotated version of the code includes comments describing the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `degrees` is a real number, and after the function call, the program returns the radian equivalent of the input `degrees`, which is also a real number.

The provided code correctly implements the conversion formula, and the assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for specific inputs. The annotations confirm that the function takes a real number as input and returns the corresponding radian value.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment of `None` can be considered accurate in the sense that it does not provide any incorrect information. However, it does not provide any evaluation of the code's correctness either. 

Given all the information available, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description. The conversion formula is applied correctly, and the assertions demonstrate the function's expected behavior.

Final: **True**
