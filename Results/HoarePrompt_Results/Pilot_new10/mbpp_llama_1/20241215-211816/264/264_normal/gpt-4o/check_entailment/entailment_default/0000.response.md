Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input `degrees` with `math.pi / 180`. This conversion factor is mathematically correct because there are `2 * pi` radians in a full circle (360 degrees), so to convert degrees to radians, we divide by 180 to get the fraction of the circle that the angle represents, then multiply by `pi` to get the equivalent radians.

The function does not include input validation or error checking, but its mathematical formula is correct for converting degrees to radians. The unit tests (assert statements) provided also validate the function's correctness for several specific cases (90, 60, and 120 degrees), which further supports the conclusion that the function behaves as expected for positive degree inputs.

However, since the problem description asks if the function works for "every potential case," one might consider cases where the input is negative, a non-numeric value, or outside the range of standard degree measurements (e.g., greater than 360 or less than -360 for angles in standard position). Despite this, given the mathematical definition of the conversion from degrees to radians, the function `func_1` applies universally regardless of the sign or magnitude of the input, assuming the input is a numeric value. The function will correctly convert any real number representing degrees into its radian equivalent without issue, making it correct for all numeric inputs within the realm of real numbers.
