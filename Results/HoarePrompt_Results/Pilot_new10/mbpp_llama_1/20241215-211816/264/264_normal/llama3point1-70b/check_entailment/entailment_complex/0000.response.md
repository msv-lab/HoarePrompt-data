Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to convert degrees to radians. The given function `func_1` takes a real number `deg` as input, applies the correct conversion formula `deg * math.pi / 180`, and returns the result in radians.

The formula used is mathematically correct, as it represents the relationship between degrees and radians: 1 degree = π/180 radians. By multiplying the input degree by π/180, the function accurately converts the degree measure to radians.

Since the function does not include any constraints or conditions that would prevent it from working for every potential real number input, it correctly implements the degree-to-radian conversion as per the problem description. The lack of error handling for non-numeric inputs does not make the function incorrect regarding the conversion itself but is rather an additional consideration for robustness. However, based strictly on the problem description provided, the function behaves as expected for its intended purpose.
