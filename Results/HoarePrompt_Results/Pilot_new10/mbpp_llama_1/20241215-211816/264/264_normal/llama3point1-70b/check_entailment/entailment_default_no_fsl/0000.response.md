Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle non-numeric inputs, as pointed out by the output hints. The function `func_1(deg)` assumes that the input `deg` is a numeric value, but it does not include any error checking to ensure this is the case. If a non-numeric input is passed to the function, it will result in a TypeError. For example, if the input is a string, the function will fail with an error message.

This means that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically for non-numeric inputs. To be considered correct, the function should either include error handling to handle non-numeric inputs or explicitly state that it only accepts numeric values. 

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to include error handling:
```python
import math

def func_1(deg):
    if not isinstance(deg, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a numeric value")
    return deg * math.pi / 180
```
This version of the function will raise an error if the input is not a numeric value, making it more robust and able to handle a wider range of potential cases.
