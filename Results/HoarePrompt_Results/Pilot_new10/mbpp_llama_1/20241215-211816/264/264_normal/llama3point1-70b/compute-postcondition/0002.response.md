To analyze the given function, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Annotated Code**: The function `func_1(deg)` takes an input `deg` and returns its equivalent value in radians by multiplying it by `math.pi / 180`. The annotation indicates that `deg` is a real number representing degrees.

2. **Return Postconditions**: The function returns the radians equivalent of the input degree, which is a real number.

Given this information, let's analyze the functionality step by step:

- The function accepts a parameter `deg`, which is expected to be a real number representing degrees. 
- It then calculates and returns the equivalent value in radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. 
- The annotations and return postconditions both confirm that the function's purpose is to convert degrees to radians.
- There are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to behave differently than described, assuming `math.pi` is correctly defined (which it is, as part of Python's standard library) and the division by 180 does not result in a division by zero error (which it cannot, since 180 is a constant non-zero value).
- The function does not handle non-numeric inputs. If `deg` is not a number, the function will throw an error when attempting to perform the multiplication and division operations. However, this behavior is consistent with the expectation that `deg` should be a real number.

Considering the provided annotations and the actual code, we can conclude that the function does indeed convert degrees to radians as described. However, it's worth noting the absence of error handling for non-numeric inputs, which could be considered a missing functionality or edge case.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a real number representing degrees, converts it to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`, and returns the result. It assumes the input is a numeric value and does not include error handling for non-numeric inputs. **
