To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to consider the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians. The formula to convert degrees to radians is \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \), which is correctly implemented in the given Python function `func_1(deg)`.

The original assessment is "None", indicating there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program before and after the function call, clarifying that the function takes a real number representing degrees, applies the conversion formula, and returns the equivalent value in radians. This annotation aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Given the information:

1. The problem description requires a function to convert degrees to radians.
2. The provided function correctly implements the conversion formula.
3. The annotated version confirms the function's behavior matches the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment of "None" does not provide any information to contradict or support the correctness of the program. However, based on the problem description and the annotated code, it is clear that the program correctly implements the required functionality.

The annotated version does not lead to a conclusion that the original assessment was inaccurate because the original assessment was simply "None", not an evaluation of correctness. Instead, the annotated version supports the conclusion that the program is correct based on the implementation of the degree to radian conversion formula.

Final: **True**
