#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a real number.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the radians equivalent of the input degree, which is a real number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a real number representing degrees, converts it to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`, and returns the result. It assumes the input is a numeric value and does not include error handling for non-numeric inputs.
