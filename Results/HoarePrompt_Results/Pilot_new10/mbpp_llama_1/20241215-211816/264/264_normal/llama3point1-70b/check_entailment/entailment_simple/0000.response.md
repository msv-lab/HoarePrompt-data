To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to check if it accurately converts degrees to radians as per the problem description. 

The conversion formula from degrees to radians is `radians = degrees * π / 180`, where `π` is a mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159.

The provided Python function `func_1(deg)` uses this exact formula:
```python
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
```

Here's why this program is correct:

1. **Correct Formula**: The program uses the correct mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians, which is `degrees * π / 180`. The `math.pi` constant in Python provides the value of `π`.

2. **Usage of `math.pi`**: By using `math.pi`, the program ensures a precise conversion, as `math.pi` is a more accurate representation of `π` than if a fixed value were hardcoded.

3. **Input and Output Type**: The problem description implies that the input (`deg`) is a real number and that the output should also be a real number. Python inherently handles the return type as a floating-point number when the division operator `/` is used with at least one float operand, ensuring the output is a real number.

4. **Handling of Negative Degrees**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the formula correctly handles negative degrees, converting them to their corresponding negative radian values, which is consistent with how angles are represented in mathematics.

5. **Zero Degrees**: The function also correctly converts 0 degrees to 0 radians, which is another important base case.

Since the program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians for all real number inputs, including negative degrees, zero, and positive degrees, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
