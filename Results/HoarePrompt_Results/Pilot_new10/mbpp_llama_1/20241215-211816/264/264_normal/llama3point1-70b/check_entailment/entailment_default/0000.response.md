Correctness: **False**.

The given Python function `func_1(deg)` is designed to convert degrees to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. While this formula is correct for converting degrees to radians, the function does not handle non-numeric inputs. According to the output hints, the function assumes the input is a numeric value and does not include error handling for non-numeric inputs. 

For example, if the input is a string, such as "30 degrees", the function will throw an error when trying to perform the multiplication. Similarly, if the input is a non-numeric value like `None`, the function will also fail. 

Therefore, the function does not work correctly for every potential case, specifically for non-numeric inputs. It should include error handling to ensure it works as expected for all possible input types. 

A correct implementation would add input validation to handle such cases, ensuring the function behaves as expected for any potential input. 

Here is a possible example of how to modify the function to add error handling:

```python
import math

def func_1(deg):
    if not isinstance(deg, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a numeric value")
    return deg * math.pi / 180
```
