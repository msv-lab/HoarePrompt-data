Given the Initial State and the provided Python code snippet, we can analyze the impact of the code on the program as follows:

- `s` is a string.
- `words` is a list of substrings of `s` that must have at least 2 words.
- `word` is the second word in the `words` list.
- The code snippet is `return True`.

This means that regardless of the values of `s`, `words`, and `word`, the program will return the boolean value `True`.

Output State: **The program returns True**
