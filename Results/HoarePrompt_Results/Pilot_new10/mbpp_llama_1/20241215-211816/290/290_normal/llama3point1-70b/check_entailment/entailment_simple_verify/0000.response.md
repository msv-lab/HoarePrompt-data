The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. Upon reviewing the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, it appears that the function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. 

The function splits the input string into words, then iterates over each word, checking if 'z' is present in the middle of the word (excluding the first and last characters). If such a condition is met, it immediately returns `True`. If it checks all words without finding 'z' in the middle of any word, it returns `False`.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program before and after the function call, and they align with the expected behavior of the function.

One potential point of confusion in the annotated version is the statement that "otherwise, it returns `None` after checking all words." However, this is incorrect, as the function actually returns `False` after checking all words, not `None`. Despite this minor discrepancy, the overall logic of the function and the annotations suggest that the original assessment is accurate.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
