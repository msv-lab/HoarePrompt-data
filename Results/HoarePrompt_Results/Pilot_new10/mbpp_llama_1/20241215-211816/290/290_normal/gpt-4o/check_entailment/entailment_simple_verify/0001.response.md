The original assessment and the annotated version of the code both support the correctness of the function `func_1` in relation to the problem description. The function checks if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word by using Python's string slicing feature, `s[1:-1]`, to exclude the first and last characters of the string. The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the function as they cover scenarios where 'z' is in the middle of the string, at the start of the string, and not in the string at all.

The annotated version of the code provides additional clarity on the state of the program at different points, reinforcing the understanding that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. It correctly identifies strings that contain 'z' in any position except the first and last characters.

Therefore, based on the given problem description, the original code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, it is reasonable to conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
