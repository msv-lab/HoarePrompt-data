Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, but the program calculates the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted sublist `arr[0:n]`.

The issue lies in the fact that the program only considers consecutive elements in the sorted array, whereas the problem description requires considering all possible pairs of elements in the array. This means that the program may miss the minimum difference if it occurs between two non-consecutive elements.

For example, consider the array `[10, 20, 3, 30]`. The program would sort this array to get `[3, 10, 20, 30]` and then calculate the minimum difference between consecutive elements, which would be `7` (between `3` and `10`). However, the minimum difference between any two elements in the array is actually `3` (between `3` and `10` is not the only option, `20` and `3` or `10` and `3` or `30` and `20` and so on, but `3` is the smallest difference, for example between `20` and `3` or `10` and `3` or `30` and `20` and so on), which is not captured by the program.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is **False**. 

Here's a revised version of the function that calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in the array:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            diff = abs(arr[j] - arr[i])
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

This function has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, but it correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

Alternatively, you can use the following function which has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

This function works by first sorting the array, and then iterating over the sorted array to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements. This approach works because the minimum difference between any two elements in the array must occur between two consecutive elements in the sorted array.
