According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given as greater than or equal to 2, this condition is satisfied. The loop iterates `n-1` times, so `i` will start from 0. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` has at least two elements, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
