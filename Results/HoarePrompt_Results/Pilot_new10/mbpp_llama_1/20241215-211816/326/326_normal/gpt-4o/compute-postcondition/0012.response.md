The code `min_diff = diff` updates the value of `min_diff` to be equal to `diff`. Since `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `min_diff` becomes `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least two elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 1, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`**
