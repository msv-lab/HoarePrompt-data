The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The initial value of `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least three elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `3 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, and `min_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least three elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `3 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, and `min_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`.**
