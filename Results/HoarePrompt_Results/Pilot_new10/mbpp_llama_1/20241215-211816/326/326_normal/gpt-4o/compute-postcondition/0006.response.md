To calculate the result, we consider the given initial state and the provided Python code. The initial state includes the following variables and their respective conditions:

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `arr` has at least two elements.
- `min_diff` is positive infinity.
- `i` is 0.

The code provided is:
```python
diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
```
This line calculates the difference between the second element and the first element of the `arr` list and assigns it to the variable `diff`, given that `i` is 0.

Considering `i` is 0 and `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `arr[i + 1]` is the second element, and `arr[i]` is the first element of the list. Since `arr` is sorted, `arr[i + 1]` is either greater than or equal to `arr[i]`, meaning `diff` will be either positive or zero.

Given the initial state, the output state after executing the provided code will be:

- `arr` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `arr` still has at least two elements.
- `min_diff` remains positive infinity.
- `i` remains 0.
- `diff` is assigned the value of `arr[1] - arr[0]`, which is the difference between the second and the first elements of the list `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` has at least two elements, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**
