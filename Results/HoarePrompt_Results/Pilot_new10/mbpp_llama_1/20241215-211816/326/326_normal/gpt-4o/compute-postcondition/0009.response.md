Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= len(arr)`, `arr` has at least two elements, if `arr[1] - arr[0]` is less than the initial value of `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, otherwise the state of `min_diff`, `i`, and `diff` remains unchanged.**
