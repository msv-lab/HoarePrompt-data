Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's why:

1. The function first checks if the array has less than 2 elements. If so, it returns 0, which is correct because you cannot calculate the difference between elements if there's only one or no elements.

2. The function then sorts the array in ascending order. This is necessary because the minimum difference will always be between adjacent elements in a sorted array.

3. It initializes `min_diff` with infinity (`float('inf')`), which ensures that the first difference calculated will be smaller.

4. The function then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. If it finds a difference that's smaller than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff`.

5. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the array is empty or has only one element, the function returns 0.
- If the array has multiple elements, the function correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements.
- The function works with both positive and negative numbers, as well as with duplicate elements.
- The time complexity of the function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, which is acceptable for this problem.

I couldn't find a single case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, so the program is correct.
