According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, since `2 <= n <= len(arr)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must be at least 3, so that `i` is still less than `n - 1`. 

Additionally, since `arr` is a sorted list of integers and the loop iterates over the indices of the list, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least three elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `3 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 2**
