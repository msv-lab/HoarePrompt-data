Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description because it only considers the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not between any two elements. 

For example, suppose we have the array `[1, 10, 2, 11]`. After sorting, this becomes `[1, 2, 10, 11]`. The minimum difference between consecutive elements is `1` (between `1` and `2`). However, the minimum difference between any two elements is also `1` (between `1` and `2`), but if we had an array like `[1, 10, 2, 3]`, the minimum difference between any two elements is `1` (between `2` and `3`), but the program would still correctly find this minimum difference.

But, consider an array like `[1, 3, 10]`. The program will correctly return `2` as the minimum difference between consecutive elements (between `1` and `3`), but this is indeed the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

However, the issue arises when the array has a large difference between two consecutive elements, but a smaller difference between two non-consecutive elements is not considered. 

Consider an array like `[1, 5, 10, 11]`. The minimum difference between consecutive elements is `1` (between `10` and `11`), but the program will return `1`, which is correct. 

However, for an array like `[1, 10, 2]`, the minimum difference between any two elements is `1` (between `1` and `2` or `2` and `10` is `8` and `1` and `10` is `9`), but the program will also return `1`, which is correct. 

The issue arises when an array has elements where the minimum difference between any two elements occurs between non-consecutive elements and is smaller than the minimum difference between consecutive elements. 

But, upon further inspection, the provided program does actually meet the problem description, because the problem description asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided program first sorts the array. After sorting, the minimum difference between any two elements will indeed be the minimum difference between two consecutive elements in the sorted array.

So, even though the provided program only explicitly calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array, this is equivalent to calculating the minimum difference between any two elements in the original array, because the sorting step ensures that the smallest difference between any two elements will be between two consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Therefore, the provided program does indeed meet the problem description, and the initial conclusion that the program is incorrect was mistaken.

Correctness: **True** 

This program always does what the problem description says because sorting the array first ensures that the minimum difference between any two elements will be between two consecutive elements in the sorted array. The program then calculates this minimum difference by iterating over the consecutive elements in the sorted array. This approach correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the original array.
