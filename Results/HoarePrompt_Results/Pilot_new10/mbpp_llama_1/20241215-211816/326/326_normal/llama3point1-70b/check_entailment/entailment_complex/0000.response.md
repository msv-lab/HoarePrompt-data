Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, but the provided program only finds the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The issue with the program is that it only compares adjacent elements in the sorted array. It does not consider the difference between non-adjacent elements. For example, if the array is `[1, 10, 11]`, the program will return `9` as the minimum difference (between `1` and `10`), but the actual minimum difference is `1` (between `10` and `11`).

To fix this, the program should compare every pair of elements in the array, not just consecutive ones. This can be achieved by using a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of elements.

Here's an example of a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return float('inf')
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[j])
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

However, this corrected version has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. A more efficient solution would be to use the fact that the minimum difference between any two elements in a sorted array must be between adjacent elements, and then find the minimum of these differences. But this only works because the problem description says that the minimum difference between any two elements is required, which means the program should have compared every pair of adjacent elements as it has done but it has been incorrectly described in the problem description. 

So after closer inspection, the original code actually does what the problem description says after all, it only does what was asked which was to find the minimum difference between any two elements, and since the array was sorted, the code was able to accomplish this by comparing every pair of adjacent elements, which are enough to find the minimum difference. So, 

Correctness: **True** 

The original code was correct, the issue was with my understanding of the code and my ability to verify it, the code was meeting the requirements specified in the problem description after all.
