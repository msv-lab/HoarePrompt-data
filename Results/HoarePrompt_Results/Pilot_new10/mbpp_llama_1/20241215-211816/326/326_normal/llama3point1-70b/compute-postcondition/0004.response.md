Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, initially `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, initially `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`. The current value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`.**
