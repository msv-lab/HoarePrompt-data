Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` takes two parameters `arr` and `target`, but the `target` is not used anywhere in the function. The problem description only asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, without mentioning any target.

A case where this program does not work correctly is when an empty array is passed to the function, or when an array with only one element is passed. In these cases, the function should return an error or a special value indicating that the minimum difference cannot be calculated, but instead, it will throw an error when trying to access `arr[0]` or `arr[i + 1]`.

However, the main issue with this function is the presence of the `target` parameter which is not used. The function should be modified to only take the array as input, or the `target` should be used in the calculation of the minimum difference. 

Also, the function will fail if the input array is not a list of numbers. The function does not include any error checking to handle such cases. 

Here's a corrected version of the function that only takes the array as input and includes error checking:
```python
def find_min_diff(arr):
    if not isinstance(arr, list) or not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in arr):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list of numbers")
    if len(arr) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must contain at least two elements")
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
