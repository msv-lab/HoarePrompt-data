The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The value of `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `min_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`**
