According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `arr`. If `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `arr` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. Since `i` is now 1, for the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 3 elements because `i` needs to be less than `len(arr) - 1`. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the second and third elements of `arr`, and `min_diff` is equal to the minimum between its original value and the previous `diff`**
