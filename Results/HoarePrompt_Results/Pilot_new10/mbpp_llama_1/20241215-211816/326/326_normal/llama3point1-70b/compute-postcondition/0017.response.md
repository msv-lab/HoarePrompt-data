The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a list of integers, and `target` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise it returns positive infinity. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise it returns positive infinity.**
