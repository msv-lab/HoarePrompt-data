Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`, `i` is 3, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is increased by 1, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged except for `i` being 3 and `current_sum` being its previous value plus `int(ticket[3])`***
