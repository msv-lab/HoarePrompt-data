Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue with the code is in the way it calculates the `target_sum`. The current implementation calculates the `target_sum` as the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of the ticket. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible segments of the ticket.

For example, consider the ticket "123456". If we want to divide this ticket into segments with equal sums, we should consider all possible segments, not just the first `segment_length` digits. The correct approach would be to calculate the `target_sum` for each possible segment of the ticket and then check if the remaining digits can be divided into segments with the same sum.

The annotations in the code also mention that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` greater than 1 and a string `ticket` of `n` digits, and returns 'YES' if the `ticket` string can be divided into two or more segments of the same sum, where the sum is equal to the sum of the first segment. However, this description is not entirely accurate, as the code does not actually check if the sum of the first segment is equal to the sum of the other segments.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to calculate the `target_sum` for each possible segment of the ticket and then check if the remaining digits can be divided into segments with the same sum. This would ensure that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to fix this issue:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_end in range(1, n):
        target_sum = sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(segment_end))
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 1
        
        for i in range(segment_end, n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    return 'NO'
```

This modified code calculates the `target_sum` for each possible segment of the ticket and then checks if the remaining digits can be divided into segments with the same sum. This ensures that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
