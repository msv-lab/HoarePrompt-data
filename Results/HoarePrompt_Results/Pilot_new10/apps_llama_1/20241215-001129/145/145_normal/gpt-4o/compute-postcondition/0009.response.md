Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state remains as it was before the if statement, since there are no changes specified in the else part.**
