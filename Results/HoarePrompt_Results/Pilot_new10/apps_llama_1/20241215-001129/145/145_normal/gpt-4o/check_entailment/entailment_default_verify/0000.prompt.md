You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the golden ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. 

One issue is that the function `func_1` only checks for segments of a fixed length, but it should check for segments of any length. For example, if the input is "12312", the program will not correctly identify that this ticket can be divided into segments "12" and "312", both with sum 3.

Another issue is that the `segment_sum` function uses the global variable `ticket`, which is not a good practice. It would be better to pass the `ticket` as an argument to the `segment_sum` function.

To correctly solve this problem, the function should try all possible segmentations of the ticket and check if the sum of the digits in each segment is equal. 

For instance, the program fails when the input is "11112" because it can be divided into segments with equal sums: "1+1+1" = 3, "1+2" = 3. But the function `func_1` does not consider this segmentation. 

Therefore, the given program does not work correctly for all potential cases and its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` greater than 1 and a string `ticket` of `n` digits, and returns 'YES' if the `ticket` string can be divided into two or more segments of the same sum, where the sum is equal to the sum of the first segment, and 'NO' otherwise, assuming the existence of a `segment_sum` function to calculate the sum of digits in a given range of the `ticket` string. 

Output hint for function_2: The function calculates the sum of digits in a string `ticket` from index `start` to `end` (inclusive), assuming `ticket` contains only digits and `start` and `end` are valid, non-negative indices where `start <= end < len(ticket)`, but does not handle cases of non-digit characters, out-of-bounds indices, or invalid input types for `start` and `end`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
