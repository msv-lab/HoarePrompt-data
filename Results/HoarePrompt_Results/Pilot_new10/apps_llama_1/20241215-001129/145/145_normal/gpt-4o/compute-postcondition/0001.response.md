The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are non-negative integers. The function is constrained by the relationship 0 <= `start` <= `end` < len(`ticket`), where `ticket` is a string of digits. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to `end` (inclusive). Therefore, the functionality of the function `segment_sum` is to accept two non-negative integer parameters `start` and `end`, and return the sum of the digits in the `ticket` string within the specified range.
