The value of `current_sum` is increased by the integer value of the `i-th` digit of `ticket`, where `i` is 2. The initial value of `current_sum` is not provided, but it can be inferred that it was initialized earlier in the code. The value of `ticket[i]` is the third digit of `ticket` since `i` is 2 and indexing starts at 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `i` is 2, and `current_sum` is its previous value plus the integer value of the third digit of `ticket`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `i` is 2, and `current_sum` is its previous value plus `int(ticket[2])`**
