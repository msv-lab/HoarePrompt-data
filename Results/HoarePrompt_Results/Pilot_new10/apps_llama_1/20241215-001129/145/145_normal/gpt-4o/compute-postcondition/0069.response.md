Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the digits of `ticket` modulo `target_sum`, and initially `current_sum` equals the sum of the digits of `ticket` modulo `target_sum`, but currently, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the total number of times the sum of the digits of `ticket` equals `target_sum`, and initially `segment_count` equals the total number of times the sum of the digits of `ticket` equals `target_sum`, but currently, `segment_count` is greater than 1, and `i` is `n`.**
