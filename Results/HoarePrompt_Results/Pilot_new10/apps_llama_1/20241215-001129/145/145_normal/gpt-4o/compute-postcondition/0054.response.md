Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is initially set to `int(ticket[0])` but the current value of `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, `segment_count` is initially 0, and `i` is initially 0; the current state reflects that the sum of the digits considered so far (`current_sum`) is equal to the `target_sum`, which is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`.**
