Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is reset to 0 and `segment_count` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Otherwise, no changes are made. `i` remains 1.***
