The code resets the value of `current_sum` to 0. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `target_sum`, which is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, i.e., `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, and `i` is 0**
