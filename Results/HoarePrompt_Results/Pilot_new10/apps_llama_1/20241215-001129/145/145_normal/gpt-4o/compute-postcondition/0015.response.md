According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `i` is 2**
