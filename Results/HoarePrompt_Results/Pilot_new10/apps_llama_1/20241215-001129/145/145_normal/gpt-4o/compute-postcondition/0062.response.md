Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them, but since there is no else part, `current_sum` is not equal to `target_sum` and `segment_count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1.**
