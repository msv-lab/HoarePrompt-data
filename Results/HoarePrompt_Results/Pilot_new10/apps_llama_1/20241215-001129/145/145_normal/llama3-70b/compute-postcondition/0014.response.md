To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given information and the provided code.

Given:
- `ticket` is a non-empty string of digits with at least two digits.
- `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even.
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
- If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1, and `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`.
- If `curr_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is equal to the sum of the integer value of the first digit in `ticket` and the integer value of the second digit in `ticket`, `segments` is 1, and `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`.

Code: `curr_sum += digit`

The code increments `curr_sum` by the value of `digit`. 

Since `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`, let's denote the first digit as `first_digit` and the second digit as `second_digit`, where both are integers. 

If `curr_sum` initially equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` was 0. So, after the code execution, `curr_sum` becomes `second_digit`.

If `curr_sum` does not initially equal `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` was the sum of `first_digit` and `second_digit`. After the code execution, `curr_sum` becomes `first_digit + second_digit + second_digit` or `first_digit + 2 * second_digit`.

In both cases, `ticket` remains unchanged as it's not modified by the code, `total_sum` also remains unchanged because it's defined by the initial state of `ticket`, and `target_sum` remains `total_sum // 2`. The value of `segments` is given as 1 and does not change with the execution of the given code. 

Therefore, the output state after executing `curr_sum += digit` is:
- `ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least two digits.
- `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even.
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
- If initially `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is the second digit in `ticket`.
- If initially `curr_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is the sum of the first digit in `ticket`, plus twice the second digit in `ticket`.
- `segments` is 1.
- `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least two digits, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `segments` is 1, `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`, and `curr_sum` is either the second digit in `ticket` if it initially equaled `target_sum`, or `first_digit + 2 * second_digit` if it did not.**
