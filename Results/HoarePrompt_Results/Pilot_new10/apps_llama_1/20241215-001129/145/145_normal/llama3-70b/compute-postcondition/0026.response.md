The function `func_1` accepts a string `ticket` composed of digits between '0' and '9'. It calculates the total sum of the digits in the ticket. If the total sum is odd, it immediately returns `False`. If the total sum is even, it attempts to divide the ticket into segments where each segment's sum equals half of the total sum. It then counts the number of such segments. The function returns `True` if there are at least two segments that sum up to half of the total sum; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

However, upon closer examination of the code, it's clear that the code does not handle cases where the input ticket is not a string or contains non-digit characters. The code also assumes that the input string is not empty. The conversion of each digit from a character to an integer for summation is implicit in the `sum(ticket)` and `curr_sum += digit` operations, which may not work as expected if the input string contains non-digit characters. The code does not explicitly handle these edge cases.

Given the actual code, if the input ticket is a string of digits and its total sum is even, the function will return `True` if it can find at least two segments summing up to half of the total sum, and `False` otherwise. If the total sum is odd, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of digits, checks if the total sum of the digits is even, and if so, attempts to divide the string into segments summing up to half of the total sum, returning True if at least two such segments exist and False otherwise; if the total sum is odd, it immediately returns False, but it does not handle cases of non-string inputs or strings containing non-digit characters. **
