Postcondition: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least three digits, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0 and `segments` is `segments + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `curr_sum` being increased by the value of `digit` prior to the if statement.**
