The value of `segments` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial state of `ticket` is still a non-empty string of digits, `total_sum` is still the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is still `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is still equal to `target_sum`, `digit` is still the first digit in `ticket` with its integer value equal to `target_sum`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, `segments` is 1, `digit` is the first digit in `ticket` with its integer value equal to `target_sum`.
Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, `segments` is 1, `digit` is the first digit in `ticket` with its integer value equal to `target_sum`.**
