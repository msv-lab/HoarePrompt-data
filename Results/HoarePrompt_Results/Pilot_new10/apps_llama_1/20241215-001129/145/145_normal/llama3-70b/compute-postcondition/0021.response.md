The code resets the value of `curr_sum` to 0. The previous value of `curr_sum` was increased by the value of `digit`, but that is no longer relevant. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`ticket` is still a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least three digits, 
`total_sum` is still the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, 
`target_sum` is still `total_sum // 2`, 
`digit` is still the third digit in `ticket`, 
`segments` is still `segments + 1`.
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least three digits, 
`total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, 
`target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, 
`digit` is the third digit in `ticket`, 
`curr_sum` is 0, 
`segments` is `segments + 1`.
Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least three digits, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is `segments + 1`.**
