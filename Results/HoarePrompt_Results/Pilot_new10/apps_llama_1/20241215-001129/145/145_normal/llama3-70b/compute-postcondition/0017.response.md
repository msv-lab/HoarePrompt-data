Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9' and has at least two digits, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, if `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segments` is 2, `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`, and `curr_sum` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.***
