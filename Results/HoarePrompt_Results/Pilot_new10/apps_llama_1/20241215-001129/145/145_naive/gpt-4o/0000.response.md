Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the golden ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. 

One issue is that the function `func_1` only checks for segments of a fixed length, but it should check for segments of any length. For example, if the input is "12312", the program will not correctly identify that this ticket can be divided into segments "12" and "312", both with sum 3.

Another issue is that the `segment_sum` function uses the global variable `ticket`, which is not a good practice. It would be better to pass the `ticket` as an argument to the `segment_sum` function.

To correctly solve this problem, the function should try all possible segmentations of the ticket and check if the sum of the digits in each segment is equal. 

For instance, the program fails when the input is "11112" because it can be divided into segments with equal sums: "1+1+1" = 3, "1+2" = 3. But the function `func_1` does not consider this segmentation. 

Therefore, the given program does not work correctly for all potential cases and its correctness is **False**.
