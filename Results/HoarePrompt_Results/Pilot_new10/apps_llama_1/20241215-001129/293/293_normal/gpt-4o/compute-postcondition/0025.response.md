The given Python code snippet only contains a print statement for `visited_count`. This statement does not modify the state of any variable but simply prints the value of `visited_count` to the console. 

Given the initial state: 
- `h` is an input integer, 
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, 
- if `h` is greater than 0, then `visited_count` equals `h`, 
- `path` is a binary string representation of `n-1` with leading zeros to make its length `h`, 
- `current_level` is 0, 
- and `current_node` equals `2 * n - 1`, 
- otherwise if `h` is 0, then `visited_count` equals 0, 
- `current_node` equals 0 and the rest of the variables remain at their initial state.

The print statement does not alter the values of any variables. It only provides output. 

Therefore, after executing the print statement, the state remains the same as initially described, with the addition that `visited_count` has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` equals 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` has been printed and is equal to `h` if `h` is greater than 0, otherwise it is 0, `path` is a binary string representation of `n-1` with leading zeros to make its length `h`, `current_level` is 0, and `current_node` equals `2 * n - 1` if `h` is greater than 0, otherwise `current_node` equals 0**
