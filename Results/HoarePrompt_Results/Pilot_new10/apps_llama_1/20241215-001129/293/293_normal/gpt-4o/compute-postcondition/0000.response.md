The given code is used to read input from the standard input. 

The line `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change the values of `h` and `n`. Instead, it reassigned the built-in `input()` function to `sys.stdin.read()` which reads the entire input as a string.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h` inclusive, `input` is now a function that reads the entire input as a string**
