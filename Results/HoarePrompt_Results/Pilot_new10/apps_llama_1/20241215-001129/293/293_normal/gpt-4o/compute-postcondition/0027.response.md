The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept parameters `h` and `n`, but instead reads them from the standard input. It calculates the total number of leaves in a binary tree of height `h` and then traverses the tree based on the binary representation of `n-1`. The function prints the number of nodes visited during this traversal, which is equal to the height `h` of the tree.

The function assumes that the input values `h` and `n` satisfy the conditions `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. However, it does not perform any error checking to ensure that these conditions are met. If the input values do not satisfy these conditions, the function may produce incorrect or unexpected results.

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `h` and `n` from the standard input, traverses a binary tree of height `h` based on the binary representation of `n-1`, and prints the number of nodes visited, which is equal to `h`, assuming `h` and `n` satisfy the conditions `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. **
