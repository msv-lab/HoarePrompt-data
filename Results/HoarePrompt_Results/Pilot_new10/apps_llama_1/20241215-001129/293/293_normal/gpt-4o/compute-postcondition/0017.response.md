To calculate the output state, we need to follow the given code and initial state.

The given code is:
```python
current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
```
However, `current_node` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming that `current_node` is a new variable or its value is not provided, we can still determine its new value based on the given expression.

Since `current_node` is not defined, let's assume its initial value is some integer `x`. After executing the code, `current_node` becomes `2 * x + 2`.

The initial state is:
- `h` is an input integer greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`
- `visited_count` is 3
- `path` is a binary string with at least one more character
- `current_level` is 1

The states of `h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, and `current_level` are not affected by the given code.

However, we should note that `current_node` is not present in the initial state, so we can't directly calculate its new value. But we can say that `current_node` is now equal to `2 * current_node + 2`, where the initial value of `current_node` is unknown.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string with at least one more character, `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is equal to 2 times its previous value plus 2**
