To calculate the output state, let's consider the initial state and the given Python code snippet.

The initial state is: `h` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 1 and the current value of `n` is an even number, `ans` is 0.

The given Python code snippet is: `ans += n // 2 - 1`.

Now, let's break down the code snippet:

- `n // 2` calculates the integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is an even number, this will result in the integer part of `n` divided by 2.
- `n // 2 - 1` subtracts 1 from the result of the integer division of `n` by 2.
- `ans += n // 2 - 1` adds the result of `n // 2 - 1` to the current value of `ans`.

Given that `ans` is initially 0 and `n` is an even number greater than 1, we can conclude that `n // 2` will be an integer greater than 0 (since `n` is greater than 1 and even), and `n // 2 - 1` will be a non-negative integer.

The new value of `ans` will be `0 + (n // 2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`. 

The value of `h` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: `h` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 1 and the current value of `n` is an even number, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 1 and the current value of `n` is an even number, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1`**
