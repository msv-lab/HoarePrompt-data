Postcondition: ***`h` is an input integer, `n` is an integer that was greater than 4 before a division by 4 (if such division occurred), and `ans` is updated based on whether `n` is even or odd: if `n` is even, `ans` is its previous value plus `n // 2 - 1`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `n // 2`.***
