According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n // 2`, which means the original value of `n` was halved. For the loop to execute one more time, `n // 2` must be greater than 1, which implies that the original `n` (before halving) must be greater than 2. 

State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is `n // 2` and the original `n` must have been greater than 2**
