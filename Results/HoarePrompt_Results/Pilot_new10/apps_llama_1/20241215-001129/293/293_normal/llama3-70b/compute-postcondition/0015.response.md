To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the variables. 

The code `ans += n // 2 - 1` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `n // 2 - 1` to it. Since `n` must have been greater than 4 before the division by 4 (which is not directly relevant to this specific line of code but indicates `n` is at least 5), `n // 2` will result in an integer value representing half of `n`, and then subtracting 1 from it.

Given that `h` is an input integer and `n` has some value that was greater than 4 at some point (implying `n` is at least 5), the expression `n // 2 - 1` will be at least `(5 // 2) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1` if we consider the minimum possible value for `n` under the given conditions.

However, without a specific initial value for `ans` and `n`, we can only describe the change in `ans` relative to its previous value. `ans` becomes its previous value plus `n // 2 - 1`.

Since `h` is not affected by the code, its state remains the same.

The initial condition that `n` must have been greater than 4 before a division by 4 suggests `n` could be any integer greater than or equal to 5 because dividing by 4 would result in a non-integer value if `n` were less than 5. However, the code snippet provided does not perform this division, so `n` could effectively be any value that meets or exceeds this threshold based on prior operations not shown.

Therefore, the output state is: `h` is an input integer, `n` is at least 5, and `ans` is its previous value plus `n // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is at least 5, and `ans` is its previous value plus `n // 2 - 1`**
