The function takes two integers, `h` and `n`, as input from the user, calculates a value `ans` based on the parity of `n` at each halving step until `n` reaches 1, and then prints `ans`. It assumes `h` and `n` are positive integers where `h` represents the height of a binary tree and `n` is an index within that tree, but does not validate these assumptions.
