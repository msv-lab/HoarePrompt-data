Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  The problem asks for the number of nodes Amr will visit before reaching the exit node, excluding the exit node itself. The program implements this by maintaining a running total of visited nodes (`ans`) and updating it based on the position of the exit node (`n`).

2.  The key insight in the problem is that the exit node's position (`n`) can be used to determine the number of nodes visited at each level of the binary tree. The program achieves this by using a while loop to repeatedly divide `n` by 2, simulating the traversal of the binary tree from the root to the exit node.

3.  Inside the loop, the program checks the parity of `n`. If `n` is even, it means the exit node is a right child, and Amr will visit `n // 2 - 1` nodes at the current level. If `n` is odd, the exit node is a left child, and Amr will visit `n // 2` nodes at the current level. The program adds the corresponding number of nodes to `ans` based on the parity of `n`.

4.  The loop continues until `n` becomes 1, indicating that Amr has reached the root level of the tree. At this point, `ans` contains the total number of nodes visited before reaching the exit node, excluding the exit node itself.

5.  The program prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the number of nodes Amr will visit before reaching the exit node.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, and it correctly calculates the number of nodes visited based on the position of the exit node in the binary tree. Therefore, the program is correct, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
