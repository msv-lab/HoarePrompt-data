According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. This does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 0**
