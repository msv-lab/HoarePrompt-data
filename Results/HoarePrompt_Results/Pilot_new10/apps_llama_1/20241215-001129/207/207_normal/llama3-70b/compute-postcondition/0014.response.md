Postcondition: ***`m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i]` equals its previous value plus `dp[i - b]`. Regardless of the condition, if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + a]` equals its previous value plus `dp[i]`.***
