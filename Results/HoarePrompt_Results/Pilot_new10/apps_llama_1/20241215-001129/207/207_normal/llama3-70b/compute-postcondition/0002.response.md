The code `dp[0] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the first element of the list `dp`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

`m` is still an input integer, `a` is still an input integer, `b` is still an input integer. 

The list `dp` is still a list of `m + 1` elements, but the first element is now 1 and the rest are still zeros.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros**
