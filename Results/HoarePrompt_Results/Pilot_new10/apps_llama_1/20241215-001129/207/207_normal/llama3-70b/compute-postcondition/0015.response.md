According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is some value. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. Since the loop condition is `i in range(m + 1)`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m + 1`, which means the previous value of `i` must be less than `m`. 

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the previous value of `i` plus 1. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as they are input integers. 

State: **`m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1**
