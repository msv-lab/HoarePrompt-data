The code line `m, a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` by taking an input, splitting it into three parts, converting each part to an integer, and assigning these integers to `m`, `a`, and `b` respectively. 

Given that `m`, `a`, and `b` are initially integers where 1 <= `m` <= 10^9, and 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^5, and considering that the new values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input, we cannot determine the exact values without knowing the input. However, we can say that `m`, `a`, and `b` are now integers equal to the input integers.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
