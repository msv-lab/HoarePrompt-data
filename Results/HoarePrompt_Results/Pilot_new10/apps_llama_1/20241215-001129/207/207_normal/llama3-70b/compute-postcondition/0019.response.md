Postcondition: **`m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i]` is its previous value plus `dp[i - b]`, and if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + a]` equals its previous value plus `dp[i]` which is now `dp[i - b]` more than before. If `i - b` is less than 0, then the state of `dp[i]` and `dp[i + a]` remains unchanged with respect to the `dp[i - b]` update, but `i` is still the previous value of `i` plus 1, and if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + a]` equals its previous value plus `dp[i]`.**
