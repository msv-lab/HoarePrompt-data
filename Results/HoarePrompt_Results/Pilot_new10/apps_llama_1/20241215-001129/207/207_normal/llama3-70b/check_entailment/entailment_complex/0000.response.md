Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue with the program lies in the way the dynamic programming list `dp` is updated. 

In the problem description, `f(x)` is defined as the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. 

However, in the program, `dp[i + a]` is updated with `dp[i]` regardless of whether the frog can actually reach `i + a` from `0` without jumping outside the interval `[0, i + a]`. 

Similarly, `dp[i]` is updated with `dp[i - b]` regardless of whether `i - b` can actually be reached from `0` without jumping outside the interval `[0, i]`. 

This means that the program is counting some integers multiple times, which is not in accordance with the problem description.

For example, if `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`, the program will count the integer `7` twice (once as `5 + 2` and once as `4 + 3`), whereas the problem description only considers distinct integers.

To correctly implement the problem description, a more careful approach is needed to ensure that each integer is only counted once and that the frog can actually reach each integer without jumping outside the allowed interval.

Here's a revised version of the code that correctly implements the problem description:

```python
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    total = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        f = 0
        visited = set()
        stack = [(0, 0)]
        while stack:
            num, steps = stack.pop()
            if num not in visited and num <= i:
                visited.add(num)
                f += 1
                if num + a <= i:
                    stack.append((num + a, steps + 1))
                if num - b >= 0:
                    stack.append((num - b, steps + 1))
        total += f
    print(total)
```

This revised version uses a set to keep track of the visited numbers and a stack to perform the DFS. It correctly calculates `f(i)` for each `i` and sums them up to get the final result.
