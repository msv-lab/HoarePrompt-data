Postcondition: ***`m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1 and the rest are zeros except for `dp[0]` and `dp[a]`, `i` is 0. If `i + a` is greater than `m`, then the state of the program remains unchanged because there is no else part to modify the variables.***
