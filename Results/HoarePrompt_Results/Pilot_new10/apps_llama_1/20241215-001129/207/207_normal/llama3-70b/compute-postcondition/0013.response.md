The code `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` increments the value of `dp[i]` by the value of `dp[i - b]`. The previous conditions and values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are still valid, and `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `dp[i + a]` when `i + a` is less than or equal to `m` is also still valid. 

Output State: **`m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `dp[i]` equals its previous value plus `dp[i - b]`, and if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + a]` equals its previous value plus `dp[i]`.**
