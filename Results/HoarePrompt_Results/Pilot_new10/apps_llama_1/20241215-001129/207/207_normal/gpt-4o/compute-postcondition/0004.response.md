The code assigns a new value to `k`, which is `a + b - 1`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `g` remain unchanged. 

Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, `a + b` will be a positive integer greater than 1, and `a + b - 1` will be a positive integer. 

The state of `g` is still equal to 1, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to 1, and `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to 1, and `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`**
