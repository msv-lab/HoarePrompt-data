To calculate the output state, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `g` is equal to 1.
- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.
- `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.

Given the code:
```python
sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
```

This code calculates the value of `sum_m` based on the values of `m` and `k`.

Let's substitute `k` with its equivalent expression `a + b - 1` into the equation for `sum_m`:
```python
sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 1 - 1) // 2
sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2
```

The states of `m`, `a`, `b`, `g`, `k`, and `sum_k` are not changed by this operation, but a new variable `sum_m` is introduced.

Given that:
- `m` is a non-negative integer and is greater than or equal to `k`,
- `k = a + b - 1`,
- `sum_k = (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`, which remains unchanged,

The output state includes the initial conditions plus the new condition for `sum_m`:
- `m` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `g` is equal to 1.
- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.
- `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.
- `sum_m` is equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`, `sum_m` is equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2**
