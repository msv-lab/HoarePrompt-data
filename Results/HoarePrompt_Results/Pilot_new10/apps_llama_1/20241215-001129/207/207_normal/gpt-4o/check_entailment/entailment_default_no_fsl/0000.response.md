Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are not relatively prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is not 1), but also `a` or `b` are larger than `m`. 

For example, when `m = 10`, `a = 4`, and `b = 3`, the function `func_2(m, a, b)` will not calculate the correct sum, because it will divide `m`, `a`, and `b` by their greatest common divisor, which in this case is 1. But then it will compare `m` with `k = a + b - 1`, which is 6. 

Since `m` is greater than `k`, it will calculate the sum as `sum_k + sum_m`. However, the frog can only reach the integers 0, 3, 4, 7, and 10. So the correct sum should be 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 35. But the function `func_2(m, a, b)` will return a different value.

Another example is when `m`, `a`, or `b` is not an integer or where `a` or `b` is not positive, the function `func_2(m, a, b)` will throw an error or return an incorrect result. 

In addition, when `m`, `a`, or `b` is very large, the function `func_2(m, a, b)` may cause an overflow error.

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case.
