To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Given:
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `g` is equal to 1.
- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.
- The current value of `m` is less than the current value of `k`.

The code snippet is:
```python
return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
```

This code calculates and returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is `m + 1` in this case.

Given that `m` is a non-negative integer and `m < k`, and knowing that `k = a + b - 1` where `a` and `b` are positive integers, we understand that `k` is at least 1 (when `a = 1` and `b = 1`, `k = 1`). Therefore, `m` can be 0, since it must be less than `k`.

The value of `g` and its equality to 1 does not directly influence the calculation of the return value, as it is not used in the formula.

The returned value is calculated as `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`, which means we are looking at the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, but since we're adding 1 to `m` and then calculating the sum up to `m + 2`, we effectively calculate the sum of the first `m + 2` integers and then adjust by subtracting the `m + 2` term which is not included in the sum, but this adjustment is inherently part of the formula used.

Since `m` is less than `k`, and `k` is at least 1 (when `a` and `b` are both 1), the minimum value of `m` can be 0. This makes the minimum returned value `(0 + 1) * (0 + 2) // 2 = 1 * 2 // 2 = 1`. As `m` increases but remains less than `k`, the returned value will increase according to the formula.

Therefore, the program returns a value that is the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, where `m` is a non-negative integer less than `a + b - 1`, and `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, which is calculated as `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`, where `m` is less than `k = a + b - 1`, and `a` and `b` are positive integers.**
