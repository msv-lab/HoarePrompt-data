You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of all f(i) for i from 0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval [0, x].

The program first calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the func_1 function. If the GCD is not 1, it recursively calls the func_2 function with a, b, and m divided by the GCD. This is a valid optimization, as the GCD represents the minimum step size the frog can take.

If the GCD is 1, the program calculates the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m. It first calculates the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to k (where k = a + b - 1), which is the sum of the first k+1 integers. If m is less than k, it returns this sum. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of f(i) for i from k+1 to m, which is the sum of the first m+1 integers minus the sum of the first k integers.

The program handles all the provided examples correctly, and it does not seem to have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct.

The logic of the program seems to be based on the following principles:

1. When the GCD of a and b is 1, the frog can reach all integers in the interval [0, m] if and only if m is greater than or equal to a + b - 1.
2. When the GCD of a and b is greater than 1, the frog can only reach integers that are multiples of the GCD.
3. The number of distinct integers the frog can reach is equal to the sum of the first m+1 integers if m is greater than or equal to a + b - 1, and is equal to the sum of the first k+1 integers otherwise.

The program correctly implements these principles, and it handles all the provided examples correctly. Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integer parameters x and y, and returns their greatest common divisor, calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, handling all potential cases except when both x and y are zero, in which case it returns 0 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a non-negative integer `m` and two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns a value based on the value of `g` calculated from `func_1(a, b)` and the comparison between `m` and `k = a + b - 1`, handling cases where `m` is less than `k` and where `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, but may not handle cases where `m`, `a`, or `b` is not an integer or where `a` or `b` is not positive, and its behavior depends on the definition of `func_1` 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
