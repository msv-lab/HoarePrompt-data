    return x
    #The program returns x, where x is the greatest common divisor of the original values of x and y, and since y is 0, it returns x as is.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters x and y, and returns their greatest common divisor, calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, handling all potential cases except when both x and y are zero, in which case it returns 0

        #The program returns the result of func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where m is a non-negative integer, a and b are positive integers, and g is the return value of func_1(a, b) not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and `g` is equal to 1
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to 1, and `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns `k + m * (m + 1) // 2`, where `k` equals `a + b - 1`, `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `a` and `b` are positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `m` and two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns a value based on the value of `g` calculated from `func_1(a, b)` and the comparison between `m` and `k = a + b - 1`, handling cases where `m` is less than `k` and where `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, but may not handle cases where `m`, `a`, or `b` is not an integer or where `a` or `b` is not positive, and its behavior depends on the definition of `func_1`
