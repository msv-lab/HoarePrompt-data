To calculate the return value, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given:
- `m` is a non-negative integer and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `g` is equal to 1 (though `g` is not used in the calculation).
- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.
- `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.
- `sum_m` is equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`.

The code returns `sum_k + sum_m`.

Substituting the given formulas for `sum_k` and `sum_m` into the return statement gives us:
```python
return (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 + m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2
```

Let's simplify this expression:
```python
return ((a + b - 1) * (a + b) - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2)) // 2 + m * (m + 1) // 2
```

Simplifying further:
```python
return (a + b - 1) * ((a + b) - (a + b - 2)) // 2 + m * (m + 1) // 2
```

Which becomes:
```python
return (a + b - 1) * 2 // 2 + m * (m + 1) // 2
```

And further:
```python
return (a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2
```

Since `k = a + b - 1` and `m >= k`, the returned value is essentially `k + m * (m + 1) // 2`, where `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is the sum of two positive integers `a` and `b` minus 1.

Output State: **The program returns `k + m * (m + 1) // 2`, where `k` equals `a + b - 1`, `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `a` and `b` are positive integers.**
