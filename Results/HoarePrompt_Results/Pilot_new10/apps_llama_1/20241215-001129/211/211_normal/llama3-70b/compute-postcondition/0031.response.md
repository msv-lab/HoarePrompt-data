Postcondition: ***`A` has a length of `n + 1`, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 2`, `i` is `n`, `prefix_sum` does not contain all zeros, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is `k + 1`, `l` is equal to `r`, and `r` retains its previous value; otherwise, the state remains unchanged, with the conditions around `k`, `l`, and `r` adjusted based on their previous values and positions within `prefix_sum`.***
