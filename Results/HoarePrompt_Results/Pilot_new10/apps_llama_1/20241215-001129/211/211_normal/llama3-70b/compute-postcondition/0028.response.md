The given code snippet is a print statement that outputs the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. This operation does not modify any variables but simply displays their current values.

Output State: **`A` has a length of `n + 1`, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 2`, `i` is `n`, `prefix_sum` does not contain all zeros, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k`, `l`, and `r` have been printed, and the conditions around `k`, `l`, and `r` remain adjusted based on the new values and positions within `prefix_sum`.**
