To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `A` has a length of `n` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
- `a` has the same length as the number of input integers.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with initial values for the first three elements specified, and the rest are 0.

Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over the range of `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

Since `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once, and since we are considering the next iteration, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time (because `i` is already 1 and needs to reach 2).

The length of `A` and the properties of `a` and `prefix_sum` do not directly influence the loop's ability to execute one more time, based on the given loop statement. Their states are determined by other parts of the program not shown here.

Therefore, adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time means:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2, specifically, it must be at least 3 for the loop to have a next iteration.

State: **`A` has a length of `n` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1`**
