The list `a` is assigned the value of a list of integers. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings, and the `map(int,...)` function converts each string in the list to an integer. The length of the list `a` and the range of its elements are not explicitly defined by the given code, but based on the initial state, we can conclude that the length of the list `a` is the input integer `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each element in `a` is an integer such that -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ i ≤ `n`. However, the code uses the `input().split()` function, which accepts a string of space-separated integers as input, so the list `a` will have a length equal to the number of integers entered as input.

Output State: **The list `A` has a length which is the input integer `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each element in `A` is an integer such that -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ i ≤ `n`, and a new list `a` is created with the same length as the number of input integers and contains the input integers.**
