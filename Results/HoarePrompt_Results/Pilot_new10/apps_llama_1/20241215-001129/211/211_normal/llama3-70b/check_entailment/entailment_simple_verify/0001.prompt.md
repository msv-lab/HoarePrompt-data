You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when there are multiple possible splits of the array. According to the problem description, if there are multiple answers, any of them should be printed. However, the given program does not correctly implement this. 

For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 -2 3 1 -3
```
The program will not print the correct output. The correct output should be:
```
YES
1
1 5
```
But the program will not print this. 

Also, there is an issue in the provided code when printing the segments. It should print two integers `l_i` and `r_i` for each segment, but the code is printing three values `k`, `l`, and `r`. 

Here's the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        segments = []
        start = 0
        for end in range(n):
            if prefix_sum[end + 1]!= 0 and (end == n - 1 or prefix_sum[end + 2]!= 0):
                segments.append((start + 1, end + 1))
                start = end + 1
        print(len(segments))
        for segment in segments:
            print(segment[0], segment[1])

func()
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a list of integers A of length n, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each element in A is an integer such that -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` has a length of `n` where 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i-1` in `a`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` > 0, and `prefix_sum` contains all zeros if `n` is 0.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` has a length of `n`, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the prefix sum of `a`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` > 0, `k` is 1 plus the number of times a non-zero and non-total sum prefix was found, `l` is the last index `r` where such a prefix sum was found, and values have been printed for each such occurrence. If `n` is 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, and no values have been printed.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`A` has a length of `n` where 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i-1` in `a`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` > 0, and `prefix_sum` contains all zeros if `n` is 0. If the current value of `prefix_sum` at index `n` is 0, 'NO' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `k` is 1 plus the number of times a non-zero and non-total sum prefix was found, `l` is the last index `r` where such a prefix sum was found, values have been printed for each such occurrence, and the values of `k`, `l`, and `n` have been printed. If `n` is 0 in this case, `k` is 1, `l` is 1.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
