Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 1. If `A[i]` is not equal to 0, 'YES', '2', '1', 2, 3, and `n` have been printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `A[i]` is equal to 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
