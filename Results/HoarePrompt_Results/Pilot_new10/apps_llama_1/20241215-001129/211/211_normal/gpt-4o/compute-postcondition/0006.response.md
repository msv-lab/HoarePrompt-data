The code prints '1' and the value of `n`. The values of the variables do not change, but '1' and the value of `n` have been printed in addition to the previous prints of 'YES' and '1'. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals the sum of all elements in `A` and ranges from `-10^5` to `10^5`, `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '1' has been printed twice, and `n` has been printed.
