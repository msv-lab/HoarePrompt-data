You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided Python function does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The main issue with the function is that it only handles two scenarios: when the total sum of the array is not zero and when the array has a single non-zero element. However, the problem requires splitting the array into multiple subarrays, each with a non-zero sum.

For example, if the input is:

```
4
1 2 1 -4
```

The function will not be able to correctly split the array into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums. The correct output should be:

```
YES
3
1 1
2 2
3 4
```

But the provided function will not produce this output. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is **False**. 

To fix this function, it needs to be modified to handle all possible scenarios and correctly split the array into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums. This can be achieved by iterating over the array, calculating the sum of each subarray, and splitting the array whenever a subarray with a non-zero sum is found. 

Here's a possible way to implement this:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = []
    temp = []
    temp_sum = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(A):
        temp.append(i + 1)
        temp_sum += num
        if temp_sum!= 0:
            result.append(temp)
            temp = []
            temp_sum = 0
    if temp:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(result))
        for subarray in result:
            print(subarray[0], subarray[-1])

func()
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer n and a list of n integers, calculates the sum of the integers, and prints 'YES' along with specific information based on whether the sum is non-zero or if a non-zero element is found in the list; if all elements are 0, it does not print anything. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
