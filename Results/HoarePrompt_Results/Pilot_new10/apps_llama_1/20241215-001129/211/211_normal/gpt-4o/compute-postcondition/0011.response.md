The code `print('2')` prints the string '2' to the console. This operation does not modify any variables. 

The states of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, `i` are not affected by this operation. 
Since 'YES' has been printed and now '2' has also been printed.


Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed, and '2' has been printed**
