The given code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a list of integers to the variable `A`. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and `map(int,...)` converts each substring to an integer.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), but the code does not directly use or modify `n`. Instead, it creates a new list `A` from the input. The length of `A` is not explicitly limited by `n` in this code snippet, but initially, we know that the number of elements `n` and the elements themselves `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` are given as part of the problem setup.

However, the code provided does not directly assign the values of `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` to `A` or use `n` to limit the input. Instead, it takes an input and splits it into integers. If we assume the input is correctly formatted to match the initial state description (i.e., `n` integers are provided as input), then `A` will contain these `n` integers.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the operation performed by the code:
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), as its value is not modified by the code.
- `A` is assigned a list of `n` integers, where each integer is within the range -10^3 to 10^3, as specified in the initial state.

The output state, considering the code's effect and the initial conditions, is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, each in the range -10^3 to 10^3.**
