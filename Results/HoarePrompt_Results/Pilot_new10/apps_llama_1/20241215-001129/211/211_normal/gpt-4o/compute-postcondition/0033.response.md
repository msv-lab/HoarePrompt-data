The function func accepts an integer n and a list of n integers as input. The code calculates the sum of the integers in the list and checks if it is not equal to 0. If the sum is not 0, it prints 'YES', '1', and the range from 1 to n. If the sum is 0, it iterates through the list to find the first non-zero element. If a non-zero element is found, it prints 'YES', '2', and specific indices. However, if all elements in the list are 0, the code does not explicitly print 'NO' as the annotations suggest. In this case, the code does not print anything after checking that the sum is 0 and not finding any non-zero elements.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer n and a list of n integers, calculates the sum of the integers, and prints 'YES' along with specific information based on whether the sum is non-zero or if a non-zero element is found in the list; if all elements are 0, it does not print anything. **
