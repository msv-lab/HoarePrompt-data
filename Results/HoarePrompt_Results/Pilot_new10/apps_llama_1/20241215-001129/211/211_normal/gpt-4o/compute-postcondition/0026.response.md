The code prints the string '1' and the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. The states of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum` are not affected. 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, and now '1' and '3' have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, and '3' has been printed**
