The given code is a break statement. This statement is used to terminate the loop or switch statement that it is a part of. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.


Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '3' has been printed, and the numbers 4 and `n` have been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
