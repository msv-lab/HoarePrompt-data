Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. One example where the code fails is when the total sum of the array is non-zero, but there is a subarray with a sum of zero. The code only checks if the total sum is non-zero or if a non-zero element is found in the list, but it does not ensure that the sum of each subarray is non-zero.

For instance, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 -3 0
```
The total sum of the array is 0, and the code will not find a non-zero element that can be split into a subarray with a non-zero sum. However, the code will not handle this case correctly and will print 'YES' with incorrect output.

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the array can be split into more than two subarrays. According to the problem description, the array can be split into "several, possibly one, new arrays", but the code only handles cases where the array can be split into one or two subarrays.

The output hints provided seem to be incomplete and do not cover all the possible cases that the code should handle according to the problem description. The code should be able to split the array into multiple subarrays, each with a non-zero sum, and handle cases where the total sum is zero or non-zero.
