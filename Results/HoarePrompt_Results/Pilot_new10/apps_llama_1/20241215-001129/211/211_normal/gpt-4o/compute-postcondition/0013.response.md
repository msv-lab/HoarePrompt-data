The code `print(i + 2, n)` prints the value of `i + 2` and `n`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). 

The value of `i + 2` is 0 + 2 = 2. The values of the other variables are not affected by this print statement. 

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' and '1' have been printed, and the values 2 and `n` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' and '1' have been printed, and the values 2 and `n` have been printed**
