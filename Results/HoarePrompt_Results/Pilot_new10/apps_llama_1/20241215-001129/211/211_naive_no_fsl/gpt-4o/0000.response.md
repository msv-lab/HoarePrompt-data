Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. One potential case it does not handle is when the total sum of the array is not zero, but all prefix sums are zero until the last element. For example, if the input is:

5
-1 1 -1 1 -1

The program will incorrectly output:

YES
1
1 5

When the correct output should be:

YES
5
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5

This is because the program only checks if the total sum is not zero, and if so, it outputs that the array can be split into one subarray. However, it does not check if the prefix sums are non-zero, which is a requirement for splitting the array.

The program also handles the case where the total sum is zero incorrectly. It tries to split the array into two subarrays, but this approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to output "NO" when the total sum is zero and all elements in the array are zero, or to split the array into single-element subarrays when the total sum is not zero.

To fix this, the program should be modified to check all prefix sums and split the array accordingly. If the total sum is zero and all elements are zero, the program should output "NO". If the total sum is not zero, the program should output "YES" and split the array into single-element subarrays if the prefix sums are zero until the last element.
