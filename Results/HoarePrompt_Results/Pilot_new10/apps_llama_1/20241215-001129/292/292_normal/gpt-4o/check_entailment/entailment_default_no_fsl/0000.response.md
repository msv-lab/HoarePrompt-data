Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code accurately implements the problem description. It correctly initializes the weights of Limak and Bob, iteratively triples and doubles their weights respectively until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, and prints the number of years required for this to happen.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem, including the examples provided. For instance, when the input is "4 7", the code correctly outputs "2" because after one year, Limak's weight becomes 12 and Bob's weight becomes 14, but after two years, Limak's weight becomes 36 and Bob's weight becomes 28, making Limak heavier.

The while loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's, which aligns with the problem's requirement that Limak wants to be larger than Bob, not just equal in weight.

The code also correctly handles edge cases, such as when Limak and Bob have equal initial weights (e.g., "1 1"), in which case Limak will become heavier after just one year.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases, including the provided examples and edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
