Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob.
2. The program initializes a variable `years` to 0, which will keep track of the number of years needed for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.
3. The program enters a while loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
4. Inside the loop, `a` is tripled and `b` is doubled, simulating the weight gain of Limak and Bob after each year.
5. The `years` variable is incremented by 1 after each iteration of the loop.
6. Once `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`, the loop exits, and the program prints the value of `years`.

The program correctly follows the problem description because:

* It simulates the weight gain of Limak and Bob after each year by tripling and doubling their weights, respectively.
* It continues to do so until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight.
* It prints the number of years needed for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When `a` is equal to `b` initially, the program will output 1, because after one year, Limak's weight will become 3 times `a`, while Bob's weight will become 2 times `b`, making Limak's weight strictly greater.
* When `a` is less than `b` initially, the program will output the correct number of years needed for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible input cases.
