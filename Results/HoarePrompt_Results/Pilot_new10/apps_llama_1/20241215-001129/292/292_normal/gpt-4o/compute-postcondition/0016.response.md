The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters `a` and `b`. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function's behavior depends on the initial weights of Limak and Bob, represented by integers `a` and `b`, where 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10.


Since there is no output description provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the return value of the function. The functionality description should be based on the given constraints and output information, but in this case, the output details are missing.


However, to follow the requested format and provide a description based on the given constraints, we can state:


Functionality: **The function depends on the initial weights of Limak and Bob, represented by integers a and b, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, but the return value is not specified.**
