Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively.
2. The while loop iteratively triples the weight of Limak (`a *= 3`) and doubles the weight of Bob (`b *= 2`) until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight (`a > b`).
3. The number of iterations (`years`) is incremented after each iteration, effectively counting the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.
4. Once the loop exits, the program prints the number of years (`years`) it took for Limak to exceed Bob's weight.

The program handles all possible cases as specified in the problem description:

* It works for any initial weights `a` and `b` where `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`.
* It correctly handles the case where Limak and Bob have equal initial weights (`a == b`), as the loop will still execute at least once to make Limak's weight greater than Bob's.
* The program does not have any issues with integer overflows, as the number of iterations is relatively small (at most 10 iterations for the given input range).

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.
