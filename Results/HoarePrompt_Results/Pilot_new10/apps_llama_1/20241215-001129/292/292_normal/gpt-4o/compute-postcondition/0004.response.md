The code `b *= 2` multiplies the value of `b` by 2. The initial state is: `a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `years` is 0. 

The value of `a` is not affected by this operation, so it remains 3 times the input integer. The value of `years` also remains unchanged at 0. However, the value of `b` is now twice its original value, which means it is now 2 times the input integer.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 0**
