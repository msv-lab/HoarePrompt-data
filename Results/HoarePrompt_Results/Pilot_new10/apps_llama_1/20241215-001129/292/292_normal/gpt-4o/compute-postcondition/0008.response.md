The given code snippet is `b *= 2`, which means `b` is multiplied by 2. Initially, `b` is 2 times the input integer. After executing the code, `b` becomes 2 times its initial value, so `b` is now 4 times the input integer.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 9 times the input integer, `b` is 4 times the input integer, `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is 9 times the input integer, `b` is 4 times the input integer, `years` is 1**
