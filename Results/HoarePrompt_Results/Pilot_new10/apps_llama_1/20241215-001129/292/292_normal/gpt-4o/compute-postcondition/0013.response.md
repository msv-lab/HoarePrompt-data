To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program. The code `years += 1` increments the value of `years` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is `3a`
- `years` is 2
- `b` is `2b`

The code only affects the variable `years`. Since `years` is initially 2, after incrementing by 1, `years` becomes 3.

The states of `a` and `b` are not affected by the code, so they remain as they were initially described.

Output State: **`a` is `3a`, `years` is 3, `b` is `2b`**
