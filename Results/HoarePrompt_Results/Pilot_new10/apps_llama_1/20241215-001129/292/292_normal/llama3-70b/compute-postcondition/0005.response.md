The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `years` is 0, so the new value of `years` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial integer value of `a` is `a / 3` and the initial integer value of `b` is `b / 2`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 3 times its initial integer value, `b` is 2 times its initial integer value, `years` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is 3 times its initial integer value, `b` is 2 times its initial integer value, `years` is 1**
