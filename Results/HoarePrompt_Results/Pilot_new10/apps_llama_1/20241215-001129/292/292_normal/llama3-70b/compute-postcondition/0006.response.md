To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

The loop condition is `while a <= b`. This means for the loop to execute again, `a` must be less than or equal to `b`.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is 3 times its initial integer value.
- `b` is 2 times its initial integer value.
- `years` is 1.

Let's denote the initial integer value of `a` as `A` and the initial integer value of `b` as `B`. Therefore, we have:
- `a = 3A`
- `b = 2B`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need `a <= b`, which translates to `3A <= 2B`.

Since we are not given the exact values of `A` and `B` but are asked to adjust the states so that the loop can certainly execute one more time, we need to ensure that the relationship `3A <= 2B` holds true.

The state of `years` being 1 does not directly affect the loop condition `a <= b`, so it does not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `3A <= 2B`, which means the initial values of `a` and `b` should be such that when `a` is 3 times its initial value and `b` is 2 times its initial value, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`a` is 3 times its initial integer value, `b` is 2 times its initial integer value, and `3A <= 2B` must hold, `years` is 1**
