According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` and `b` are integers, and `years` is 0. The value of `years` does not affect the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted. For `a` and `b` being integers does not ensure that the loop will execute, so their relationship needs to be adjusted to `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, and `years` is 0**
