You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

This program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem. It continuously triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, at which point it outputs the number of years that have passed.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The program starts by taking the initial weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`) as input.
2. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
3. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
4. The loop also increments a `years` counter by 1 in each iteration, which keeps track of the number of years that have passed.
5. Once Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight (`a > b`), the loop exits and the program outputs the number of years that have passed (`print(years)`).

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When Limak's weight is initially less than Bob's weight.
* When Limak's weight is initially equal to Bob's weight.
* When Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight after one or more years.

All the provided examples work correctly with this program, and there are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10.
def func():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        
        b *= 2
        
        years += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `years` is the number of iterations for `a` to exceed `b` with their respective multiplications, `a` is the initial `a` multiplied by \(3^{years}\), `b` is the initial `b` multiplied by \(2^{years}\), unless initially `a` > `b`, in which case `years` is 0, and `a` and `b` retain their initial values.
    print(years)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, multiplies the first by 3 and the second by 2 in each iteration until the first exceeds the second, and prints the number of iterations required for this condition to be met, working with any integer inputs regardless of their initial values or ranges.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
