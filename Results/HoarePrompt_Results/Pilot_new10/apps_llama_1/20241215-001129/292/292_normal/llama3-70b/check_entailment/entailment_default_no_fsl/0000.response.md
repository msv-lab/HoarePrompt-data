Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to the input values, representing the weights of Limak and Bob respectively. It then enters a loop that continues until `a` is greater than `b`, simulating the tripling of Limak's weight and the doubling of Bob's weight each year. The number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob is tracked by the `years` variable, which is incremented at the end of each iteration.

All the provided examples in the problem description agree with the code's output. The code also handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are initially equal, returning 1 as expected. Additionally, the code works with any integer inputs, regardless of their initial values or ranges, as demonstrated by the output hints.

The loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, at which point the loop terminates and the number of years is printed. This logic accurately reflects the problem description, which requires Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem's requirements, and there are no apparent cases where it does not work as expected.
