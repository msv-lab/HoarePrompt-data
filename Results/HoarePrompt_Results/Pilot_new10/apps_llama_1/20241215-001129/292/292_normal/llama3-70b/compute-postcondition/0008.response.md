The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. The initial state of `b` is 2 times its initial integer value. Let's denote the initial integer value of `b` as `x`. Then, `b` is initially `2x`. After multiplication by 2, `b` becomes `2 * 2x = 4x`. 

The value of `a` is 9 times its initial integer value. Let's denote the initial integer value of `a` as `y`. Then, `a` is `9y`. 

The condition `3A <= 2B` is given. Substituting the expressions for `a` and `b`, we have `3 * 9y <= 2 * 2x`, which simplifies to `27y <= 4x`.

The value of `years` is 1 and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 9 times its initial integer value, `b` is 4 times its initial integer value, `3A <= 2B` which means `27y <= 4x` where `a = 9y` and `b = 4x`, `years` is 1**
