You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find out after how many full years Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- It initializes the number of years to 0.
- It enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
- Inside the loop, it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight (simulating one year), and increments the number of years.
- Once Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's, it breaks out of the loop and prints the number of years.

The program correctly handles all the given examples and general cases. For instance, if Limak and Bob initially weigh the same, the program will correctly output 1 because Limak will become larger after the first year. 

Since the weights are multiplied by constants (3 for Limak and 2 for Bob) every year, and these constants are relatively prime, there will always be a point where Limak becomes strictly larger than Bob if he is not already. The while loop guarantees that this point is found.

The program does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It adheres to the problem description and works correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integer parameters, multiplies the first by 3 and the second by 2 in each iteration until the first exceeds the second, and prints the number of iterations required for this condition to be met, working with any integer inputs regardless of their initial values or ranges. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
