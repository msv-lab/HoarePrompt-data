The code provided is a print statement that outputs the value of `years`. This operation does not modify the values of `years`, `a`, or `b`. It simply displays the current value of `years`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the value of `years` has been printed.

Output State: **`years` is the number of iterations for `a` to exceed `b` with their respective multiplications, `a` is the initial `a` multiplied by \(3^{years}\), `b` is the initial `b` multiplied by \(2^{years}\), unless initially `a` > `b`, in which case `years` is 0, and `a` and `b` retain their initial values, and the value of `years` has been printed.**
