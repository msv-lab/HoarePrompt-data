The function `func` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` as input from the user, where initially it is stated that 1 <= `a` <= `b` <= 10. However, the code itself does not enforce these constraints; it simply takes two integers as input. The function then enters a loop where `a` is multiplied by 3 and `b` is multiplied by 2 in each iteration until `a` exceeds `b`. The number of iterations (years) it takes for `a` to exceed `b` is counted and then printed. 

It's worth noting that the annotations suggest `a` and `b` are within specific ranges, but this is not enforced by the code. The code will work with any two integers provided as input, regardless of their range. Additionally, if `a` is initially greater than `b`, the loop will not execute, and `years` will remain 0, which aligns with the state described after the loop execution in the annotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, multiplies the first by 3 and the second by 2 in each iteration until the first exceeds the second, and prints the number of iterations required for this condition to be met, working with any integer inputs regardless of their initial values or ranges. **
