The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is stated that there are parameter constraints for 'a' and 'b', which implies these variables should be part of the function parameters. Based on the given constraints: 

The function `func` should accept two parameters `a` and `b`. `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a` <= `b` <= 10. 

Since there are no output details provided for this function, we cannot determine the return value of the function.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b where a and b are integers, 1 <= a <= b <= 10, but the return values are not defined.**
