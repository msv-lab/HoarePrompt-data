Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing Limak's and Bob's initial weights, respectively. This matches the problem description's input format.
2. The program initializes a `years` variable to 0, which will keep track of the number of full years that pass before Limak becomes strictly larger than Bob.
3. The program enters a while loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. In each iteration, `a` is multiplied by 3 (to simulate Limak's weight tripling) and `b` is multiplied by 2 (to simulate Bob's weight doubling). This matches the problem description's rules for how Limak's and Bob's weights change each year.
4. After each iteration, the `years` variable is incremented by 1. This accurately counts the number of full years that have passed.
5. Once `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`, the loop exits, and the program prints the final value of `years`. This is the correct output format according to the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When `a` is initially less than `b`, the program will correctly simulate the years passing and print the number of years it takes for Limak to become larger.
* When `a` is initially equal to `b`, the program will correctly simulate the years passing and print the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger.
* The program's use of a while loop ensures that it will work for any initial values of `a` and `b`, not just those in the specified range.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description, and it should produce the correct output for all possible input cases.
