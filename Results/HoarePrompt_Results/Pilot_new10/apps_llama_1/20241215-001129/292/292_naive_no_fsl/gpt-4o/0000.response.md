Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the initial weights of Limak and Bob as input, then enters a loop where it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight, incrementing the number of years each time. The loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight, at which point it prints the number of years.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. It correctly handles the case where Limak and Bob have the same initial weight, as well as cases where Limak's initial weight is less than Bob's. The program also correctly handles cases where Limak becomes larger than Bob after one year, as well as cases where it takes multiple years for Limak to become larger.

The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For example, when the input is 4 7, the program correctly outputs 2, which is the number of years it takes for Limak to become larger than Bob. Similarly, when the input is 4 9, the program correctly outputs 3, and when the input is 1 1, the program correctly outputs 1.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible cases.
