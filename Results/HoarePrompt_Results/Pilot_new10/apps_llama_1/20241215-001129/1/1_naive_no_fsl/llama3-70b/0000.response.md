Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One example where the program fails is when the input string does not contain '[' or ']' but contains ':' and '|'. In this case, the program should return -1 because it's impossible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from the string. However, the program may return a wrong answer in such cases.

For example, if the input string is ":||:", the program will incorrectly return 4 because it finds the ':' characters but does not check if '[' and ']' are present in the correct order.

Another case where the program may fail is when there are multiple '[' or ']' characters in the string. In this case, the program should find the first '[' and the last ']' characters and then calculate the length of the accordion. However, the current implementation of the program only finds the first occurrence of '[' and ':' from the start and the last occurrence of ']' and ':' from the end, which may not be the correct pair of '[' and ']' to form an accordion.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to correctly handle these edge cases. It should check for the presence of '[' and ']' in the correct order and find the correct pair of '[' and ']' characters to form an accordion. 

Here is a simple case where the program fails: 

input: a[:|
output: -1 ( Expected ), but for the following input 
a[:|
it should fail but the description is too general so let's provide one example more clear
Input 
[:[:]
Expected output -1
it currently fails in this example, and the description does not specify if the strings must be ordered or if you need both of [ ] or [:] to return an answer different than -1.

For the string a[:| the current output is indeed -1 and that is correct, so a good example would be 
[:[:] 
you can confirm it using an online compiler or your python environment.
