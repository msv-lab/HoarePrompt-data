You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            ind = i
            break
    bind = -1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            bind = i
            break
    if ind == -1 or bind == -1 or ind >= bind:
        print(-1)
    else:
        start_colon = -1
        for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
            if s[i] == ':':
                start_colon = i
                break
        end_colon = -1
        for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
            if s[i] == ':':
                end_colon = i
                break
        if start_colon == -1 or end_colon == -1 or start_colon >= end_colon:
            print(-1)
        else:
            pipe_count = 0
            for i in range(start_colon + 1, end_colon):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    pipe_count += 1
            result = 4 + pipe_count
            print(result)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not work correctly in all cases. One such case is when the input string contains multiple accordions. The program currently only checks for the first occurrence of '[' and ']' and then searches for ':' within that range. If there are multiple pairs of '[' and ']', the program may not find the correct pair or may return a wrong result. 

For example, if the input string is "[::|][::|]", the program will not return the correct maximum possible length of the resulting accordion. 

Another potential issue with the program is that it breaks the loop as soon as it finds the first occurrence of '[' and ']'. If the string starts with ']' or ends with '[', the program will return -1, but it should actually continue to check for other occurrences of '[' and ']' in the string.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to check for all occurrences of '[' and ']' and then find the maximum possible length of the resulting accordion. 

Here is an example of how the issue can be demonstrated:
Input: "[::|][::|]"
Expected output: 8
Actual output: 4 

This shows that the program does not work correctly for all inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `s` and returns the count of '|' characters between the first and last ':' characters within a pair of '[' and ']' characters, plus 4, if such a structure exists in the string; otherwise, it returns -1. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
