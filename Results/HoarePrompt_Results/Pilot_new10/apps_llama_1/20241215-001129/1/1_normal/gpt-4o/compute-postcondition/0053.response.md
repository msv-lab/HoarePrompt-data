The value of `end_colon` is updated to `i`, which is `bind - 1` and `s[i]` is `:`, so `end_colon` becomes equal to `bind - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`, `i` is `bind - 1`, the current value of `s[i]` is ':', `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character in `s` between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, or -1 if no ':' character is found in the range, and `end_colon` is `bind - 1`**
