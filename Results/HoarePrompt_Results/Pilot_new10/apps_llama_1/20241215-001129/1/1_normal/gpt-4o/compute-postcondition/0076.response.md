According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start_colon` and `end_colon`. If `i` is less than `end_colon`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `start_colon + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `start_colon + 3`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `end_colon`. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s`, `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character in `s` between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the last ':' character in `s` between `bind - 1` and `ind` (inclusive), `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `i` is `start_colon + 3**, if `s[i-1]` is '|', then `pipe_count` is increased by 1**
