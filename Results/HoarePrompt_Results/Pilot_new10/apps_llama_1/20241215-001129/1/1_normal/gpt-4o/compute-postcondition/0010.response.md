The code `break` is executed, which means we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `s`, `n`, `i`, and `ind` do not change.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
