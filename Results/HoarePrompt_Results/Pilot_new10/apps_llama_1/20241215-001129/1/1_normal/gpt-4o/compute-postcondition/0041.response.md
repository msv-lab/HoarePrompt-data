According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind`, `bind`, and `i`. If `i` is less than `bind`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is at most `bind - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes `bind` or less if the loop body changes `i`, and `ind` and `bind` may also change depending on the loop body. But for the loop condition to be true again `i` must be less than `bind` so `i` must be at most `bind - 1`. The condition in the loop, `range(ind + 1, bind)`, is checked at the start of each iteration, so for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be the next index in the range which is `i + 1`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and not -1, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 2`**
