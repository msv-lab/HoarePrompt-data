To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

Given the loop statement `for i in range(n):`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The condition for `n` to be greater than 1 is already met since `i` has only reached 1, and we are considering the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 2.

The state of `s` and the conditions related to `s[i]`, `ind`, and the breaking out of loops or if statements do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute the next iteration based on the provided loop statement. They might influence the loop body's execution but not the loop's continuation condition.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), as its state does not directly influence the loop's continuation based on the given loop statement.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute the next iteration.
- `i` is 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2**
