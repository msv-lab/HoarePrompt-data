Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s`. If `start_colon == -1`, `end_colon == -1`, or `start_colon >= end_colon`, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character in `s` between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the last ':' character in `s` between `bind - 1` and `ind` (inclusive), `i` is `end_colon - 1` if the loop executes, otherwise `i` remains as its initial value, `pipe_count` is the total number of '|' characters in the substring of `s` from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon - 1`, `result` is `4 + pipe_count`, and the value of `result` has been printed.***
