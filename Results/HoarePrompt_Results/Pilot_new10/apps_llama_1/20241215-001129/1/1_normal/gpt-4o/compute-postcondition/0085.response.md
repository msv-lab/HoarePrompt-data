The function `func` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) as input from the user. 

It finds the first '[' character and the first ']' character from the end of the string. If either of these characters is not found, or if the index of the '[' character is greater than or equal to the index of the ']' character, the function prints -1.

If the '[' and ']' characters are found and the index of the '[' character is less than the index of the ']' character, the function then finds the first ':' character after the '[' character and the last ':' character before the ']' character. If either of these ':' characters is not found, or if the index of the first ':' character is greater than or equal to the index of the last ':' character, the function prints -1.

If the first and last ':' characters are found and their indices are valid, the function then counts the number of '|' characters between these ':' characters (exclusive) and prints the result of adding 4 to this count.

The functionality of the function is to parse a string and return the count of '|' characters between the first and last ':' characters within a pair of '[' and ']' characters, plus 4, if such a structure exists in the string. If the string does not contain a valid '[' and ']' pair, or a valid ':' pair within such a pair, the function returns -1.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns the count of '|' characters between the first and last ':' characters within a pair of '[' and ']' characters, plus 4, if such a structure exists in the string; otherwise, it returns -1. **
