Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first '[' character in `s`. If `s[i]` equals ']', then `i` is `n-2`, `bind` is `n-2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` does not equal ']', then the state of `i`, `bind`, and the loop remains unchanged, with `i` still being `n-2`.***
