According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 500000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. The loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 2, but since `n` is between 2 and 500000 (inclusive) and we have just executed the loop for `i` equals 1, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 2**
