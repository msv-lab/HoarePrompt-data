Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is either -1 or `bind - 1` if the loop executes, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`, `ind` and `bind` are not -1, and either the value -1 has been printed when `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, or the value 4 plus the number of '|' characters in the substring of `s` from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1` has been returned at the output when `ind` is less than `bind`.**
