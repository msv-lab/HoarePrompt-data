The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The initial state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `ind` is 1. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
