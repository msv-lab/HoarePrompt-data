The code assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 2, so `ind` will be assigned the value 2. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, and `ind` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `ind` is 2**
