Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is '[', then `f` is `True`. If `s[2]` is ':', then if condition `f` is true, `ind` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s[2]` is neither '[' nor ':', the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
