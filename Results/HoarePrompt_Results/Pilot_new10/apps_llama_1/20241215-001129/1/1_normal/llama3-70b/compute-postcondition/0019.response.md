Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 2 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, if the condition `f` is met, then `ind` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition since there is no else part that modifies them***
