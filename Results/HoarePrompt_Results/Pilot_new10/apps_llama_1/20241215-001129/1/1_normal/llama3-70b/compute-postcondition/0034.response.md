The value of `f` is changed to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, the current value of `i` is the index of the last character of `s`, `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1, the character at the index `i` of `s` is ']', and `f` is `True`.
