Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the way it constructs the sequence of powers of 2. The program starts from the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` and subtracts it, repeating this process until it can no longer do so. However, this greedy approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will have the smallest maximum power of 2.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input: `n = 6, k = 3`

The program will output "Yes" followed by the sequence `2 1 0` (or a permutation of it), which indeed sums up to 6 (4 + 2 + 0 = 6). However, this sequence does not have the smallest maximum power of 2. A different sequence `1 1 1` (or a permutation of it) also sums up to 6 (2 + 2 + 2 = 6), but has a smaller maximum power of 2.

The program fails to find this optimal sequence because it is based on a greedy strategy that does not consider all possible combinations. To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming to explore all possible sequences and find the one that meets the conditions.

Another issue with the given program is that it does not handle negative powers of 2. According to the problem description, negative powers of 2 are allowed, but the program does not consider them. This means that it may miss some valid sequences that include negative powers of 2.

In summary, the given program does not correctly solve the problem due to its greedy approach and lack of consideration for negative powers of 2. A more comprehensive and careful approach is needed to find the correct solution.
