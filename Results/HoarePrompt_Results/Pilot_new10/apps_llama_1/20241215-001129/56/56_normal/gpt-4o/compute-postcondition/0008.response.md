To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(60, -1, -1):`, which means `i` will decrement by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n. If the 60th bit of `n` is 1, `bits` is a list containing the value 60 and `i` is 60, otherwise `bits` is an empty list and `i` is 60.

Since the loop has already executed once (for `i` = 60), we need to decrement `i` by 1 to get the new state.

So, the new state will be: `n` is still a non-negative integer, `k` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n. If the 60th bit of `n` is 1, `bits` is still a list containing the value 60, and `i` is now 59. If the 60th bit of `n` is 0, `bits` is still an empty list, and `i` is now 59.

However, since we don't have information about the 59th bit of `n`, we cannot determine if `bits` will be updated or not. But we can say that `i` will be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `i` is 59, if the 60th bit of `n` is 1, `bits` is a list containing the value 60, otherwise `bits` is an empty list**
