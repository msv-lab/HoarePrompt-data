The code appends the value of `i` to the `bits` list. The value of `i` is 60. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is a list containing the value 60, `i` is 60, and the 60th bit of `n` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is a list containing the value 60, `i` is 60, and the 60th bit of `n` is 1**
