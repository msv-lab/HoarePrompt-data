Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The program first checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it returns 'No' because it's impossible to find `k` integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals `n`.

2. **Bit Extraction**: The program then extracts the indices of all bits set in the binary representation of `n`. These bits represent the powers of two that sum up to `n`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**: The program checks if the number of bits set in `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If it's greater than `k`, the program returns 'No' because it's impossible to find `k` integers that satisfy the condition.

4. **Bit Duplication**: If the number of bits set in `n` is less than `k`, the program duplicates the smallest bit to make up for the difference. This process is repeated until `k` bits are obtained.

5. **Sorting and Output**: Finally, the program sorts the bits in descending order and returns 'Yes' followed by the `k` bit indices.

The program always follows the problem description because:

* It correctly handles the base case where `k` is greater than `n`.
* It accurately extracts the bits set in the binary representation of `n`.
* It checks for the feasibility of finding `k` integers that satisfy the condition.
* It duplicates the smallest bit to make up for the difference between the number of bits set in `n` and `k`.
* It sorts the bits in descending order to ensure lexicographical maximality.

The program does not miss any potential cases because it considers all possible scenarios:

* `k` is greater than `n`.
* The number of bits set in `n` is greater than `k`.
* The number of bits set in `n` is less than or equal to `k`.

In each of these cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
