The code snippet `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the `bits` list and assigns it to the `smallest` variable. 

Since `smallest` is the last element that was removed from the `bits` list, after this operation, `smallest` will be the second last element that was in the `bits` list. 

Also, after the `pop` operation, the length of `bits` will decrease by 1.

The other variables: `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order, with three elements removed and `smallest - 1` appended twice, `i` is -1, `smallest` is the second last element that was in the `bits` list, and the length of `bits` is still less than `k`**
