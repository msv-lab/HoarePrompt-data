Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `i` is 58. If the 58th bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` is a list containing the value 58. Otherwise, no additional information is provided about the state of the program variables.***
