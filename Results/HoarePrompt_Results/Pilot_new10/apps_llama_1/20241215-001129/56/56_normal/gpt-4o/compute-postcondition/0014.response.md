To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(60, -1, -1):
    if n >> i & 1:
        bits.append(i)
```
This loop iterates over the bits of the number `n` from the 60th bit to the 0th bit. If a bit is 1, its index is appended to the `bits` list.

From the given output states, we can observe that:

* If the `i`-th bit of `n` is 1, the index `i` is appended to the `bits` list.
* If the `i`-th bit of `n` is 0, the `bits` list remains unchanged.
* The loop iterates over all bits from 60 to 0, regardless of the value of `n`.

After all iterations have finished, the `bits` list will contain the indices of all bits in `n` that are 1, in descending order (from 60 to 0). The `i` variable will be -1, since the loop iterates until `i` is -1.

The value of `n` and `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop, since they are not modified by the loop code.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), the `bits` list will remain empty, since no bits are appended to it.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order, and `i` is -1.**
