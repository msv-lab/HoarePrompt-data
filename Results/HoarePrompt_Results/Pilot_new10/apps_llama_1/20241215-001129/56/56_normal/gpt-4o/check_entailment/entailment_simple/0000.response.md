Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1.  **Handling Non-Existent Sequences:** The program first checks if `k` is greater than `n`. In this case, it immediately returns "No" because it's impossible to find `k` integers (each representing a power of 2) that sum up to `n` when there are more integers than the sum can accommodate. It further checks if the number of bits set in `n` is more than `k`, in which case, it also returns "No" because adding more numbers (with smaller exponents) won't satisfy the sum requirement due to the binary representation of `n`.

2.  **Generating the Sequence:** The program generates the sequence of powers that sum up to `n` by first finding all the bits set in `n` (stored in `bits`). These represent the powers of 2 that directly contribute to `n`. If the number of these bits (and thus powers of 2) is less than `k`, the program iteratively splits the smallest power into two smaller powers until the desired length `k` is achieved.

3.  **Lexicographical Order:** The program ensures the generated sequence is in lexicographical order by sorting the powers of 2 in descending order before outputting them. This step guarantees that among all sequences with the minimum maximum power, the program selects the one that is lexicographically largest.

4.  **Smallest Maximum Power:** The way the program constructs the sequence by splitting the smallest power of 2 and then sorting ensures that it achieves the smallest possible maximum power in the sequence. This is because it prioritizes using the smallest available power to fulfill the `k` length requirement, effectively minimizing the maximum power used.

5.  **Handling Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases, such as when `n` equals `1` and `k` equals `2`, correctly by returning `Yes` followed by `-1 -1`, which is a valid sequence where two instances of `2^-1` sum up to `1`.

In conclusion, the program correctly implements the logic to find `k` integers such that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals `n`, with the largest integer in the answer being as small as possible, and among such sequences, it returns the one that is lexicographically largest. This implementation aligns with the problem description, making the program correct for all potential cases.
