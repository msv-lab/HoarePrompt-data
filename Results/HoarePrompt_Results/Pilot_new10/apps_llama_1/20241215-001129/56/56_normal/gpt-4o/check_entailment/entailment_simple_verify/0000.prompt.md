You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a solution to the problem described, and it seems to handle all possible cases correctly. Here's an explanation of why I believe the program is correct:

1. **Handling cases where k > n**: The program correctly returns 'No' when k is greater than n, as it's impossible to find k integers such that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals n.

2. **Bit manipulation**: The program uses bit manipulation to find the positions of the bits set in the binary representation of n. This is done using a loop that starts from the most significant bit (60) and goes down to the least significant bit (0).

3. **Checking if the number of bits is greater than k**: If the number of bits set in n is greater than k, the program returns 'No', as it's impossible to find k integers that satisfy the condition.

4. **Handling cases where the number of bits is less than k**: If the number of bits set in n is less than k, the program enters a loop that reduces the smallest bit set in n by 1 and adds two new bits with the reduced value. This process continues until the number of bits is equal to k.

5. **Sorting the bits in descending order**: Finally, the program sorts the bits in descending order and returns them as a string.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly, including edge cases like k > n, k == n, and k < n. It also correctly handles the case where n is 0.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
