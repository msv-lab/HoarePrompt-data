The given code initializes an empty list `bits`. 

Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, these conditions are still valid after the code has been executed. 

The new variable `bits` is an empty list. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is an empty list**
