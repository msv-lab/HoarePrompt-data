The code `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the `bits` list and assigns it to the `smallest` variable. 

Since `smallest` was already the smallest index in the original `bits` list, after popping an element from the list, `smallest` will now be the last element that was removed from the list, which is the smallest index in the original list. 

The length of `bits` will decrease by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order, with two elements removed and `smallest - 1` appended, `i` is -1, `smallest` is the last element that was removed from the `bits` list, and the length of `bits` is still less than `k` but decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order, with two elements removed and `smallest - 1` appended, `i` is -1, `smallest` is the last element that was removed from the `bits` list, and the length of `bits` is still less than `k` but decreased by 1.**
