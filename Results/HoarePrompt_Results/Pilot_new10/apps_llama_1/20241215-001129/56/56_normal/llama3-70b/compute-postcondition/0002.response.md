The code snippet provided is a simple print statement that prints the string 'No'. This statement does not modify the values of any variables. 

The initial state is: `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, and the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. 

Since the print statement does not change the values of `n` and `k`, and does not introduce any new variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that 'No' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `n` is less than `k`, and 'No' has been printed**
