To determine the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code `x = n.bit_length() - 1` calculates the bit length of the integer `n` and then subtracts 1 from this length to assign it to `x`.

Given that `n` must be greater than 2, the minimum value for `n` is 3. 

- For `n = 3`, `n.bit_length()` equals 2 because 3 can be represented in binary as '11', which requires 2 bits. Thus, `x = 2 - 1 = 1`.
- As `n` increases, so does its bit length. For example, for `n = 4` (which is '100' in binary), `n.bit_length()` equals 3, making `x = 3 - 1 = 2`.
- The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.

The initial state also mentions that `i` is increased by 1 from its previous state, but since we do not know the previous state of `i`, we can only acknowledge that `i` has been incremented without specifying its new value.

Therefore, considering all information:
- `n` is still greater than 2.
- `i` has been increased by 1 from its previous state.
- `x` is now equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous state, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`**
