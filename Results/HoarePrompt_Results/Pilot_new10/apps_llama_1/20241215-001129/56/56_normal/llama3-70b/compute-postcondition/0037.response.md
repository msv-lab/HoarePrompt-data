Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, if `n` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. If `n` is not less than `k`, then `n` is either 0 or a positive value, and `a` is a list. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. If the length of `a` is equal to `k`, `a` is sorted in descending order, 'Yes' has been printed, and the contents of `a` have been printed.**
