Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code does not correctly handle cases where `n` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of `2`, and it does not guarantee that the resulting sequence is the lexicographically largest.

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment. The code breaks out of the loop when `x <= i`, which means that it does not continue to find the remaining powers of `2` that sum up to `n`. This can lead to incorrect results when `n` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of `2`.

Additionally, the code sorts the sequence in descending order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`, which does not guarantee that the resulting sequence is the lexicographically largest. The lexicographically largest sequence is the one that has the largest possible values in the most significant positions.

The example provided in the original assessment, where the input is `1 2` and the expected output is `Yes` followed by `-1 -1`, also confirms that the code is incorrect. The code does not handle negative exponents correctly and does not produce the expected output for this case.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
