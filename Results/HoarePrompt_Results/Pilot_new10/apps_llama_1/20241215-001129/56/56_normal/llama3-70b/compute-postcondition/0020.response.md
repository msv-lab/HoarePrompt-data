To solve this, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is `n - 2`. This seems to be a condition or an equation rather than a direct assignment of a value to `n`. It implies `n = n - 2`, which simplifies to `0 = -2`, indicating a contradiction or an error in the initial condition as stated. However, interpreting this as `n` being equal to some value that is `n - 2` doesn't make sense in standard mathematical or programming terms because it suggests an equation that cannot hold true for any value of `n` except in a scenario where we're discussing a change or an equation that needs to be solved for `n`. For the sake of proceeding with an analysis, let's assume there's an initial value of `n` and `i`, and we're focusing on how `i` changes.

Given the code `i += 1`, this means we are incrementing `i` by 1.

Since the initial state description for `n` is not directly usable as it stands (`n` is `n - 2`), and assuming `i` had some initial value, the only clear action we can determine from the given code is the incrementation of `i`.

Thus, the output state, given that we can't accurately apply the initial condition for `n` as it's paradoxical, would focus on the change to `i`:

Output State: **`n` is as initially defined but with an acknowledged inconsistency in its description, and `i` is increased by 1.**
