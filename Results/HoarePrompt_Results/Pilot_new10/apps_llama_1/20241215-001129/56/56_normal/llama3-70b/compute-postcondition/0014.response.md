To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

The loop condition is `while n > 0`, meaning the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is as defined by the equation `n = n - 2`, which means `n` has been decreased by 2 from its previous value.
- `i` is increased by 1 from its previous state, but the loop condition does not depend on `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 after the previous iteration. Given that `n` is decreased by 2 in each iteration, for it to be greater than 0 after the last decrease, it must have been greater than 2 before the decrease (since `n - 2 > 0` implies `n > 2`).

Therefore, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted so that it is greater than 2 after the previous decrease, ensuring it can be decreased by 2 again and still satisfy the loop condition `n > 0`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous state**
