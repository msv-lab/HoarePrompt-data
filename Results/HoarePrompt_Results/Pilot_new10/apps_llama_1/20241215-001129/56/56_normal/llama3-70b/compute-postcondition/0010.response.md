Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the first input integer and greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is a list, `i` is an integer, and `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `n` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as the initial state.***
