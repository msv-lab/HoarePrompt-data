Correctness: **False**.

The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

The code attempts to construct a list of 'k' integers representing the powers of 2 that sum up to 'n' by starting from the largest possible power of 2 and decrementing it until 'n' becomes 0 or 'k' numbers have been found. However, this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically largest sequence, especially when 'n' is not a power of 2.

One case where the code does not work correctly is when 'n' is a number that can be represented as a sum of smaller powers of 2, but not as a sum of 'k' identical powers of 2. For example, consider the input '23 5'. The code will output '3 3 2 1 0' which is correct, but if we change 'n' to '24' which is '16 + 4 + 2 + 2', the code will not output the correct answer '4 2 2 1 1', because it prioritizes using larger powers of 2.

Moreover, the code does not handle the case when 'n' can be represented as a sum of negative powers of 2. For example, if 'n' is '1' and 'k' is '2', the code should output '-1 -1' because '2^-1 + 2^-1 = 1', but the code will output 'No' because it does not consider negative powers of 2.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
