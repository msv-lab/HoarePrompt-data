To solve this, let's break down the information given and the operation performed.

Initial State: `n` is `n - 2`. This implies that `n` has been assigned a value that is 2 less than its previous value. However, without knowing the original value of `n`, we can only express this relationship as given.

The code then executes: `i += 1`. This means the value of `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state and the operation:
- The value of `n` is as stated, `n - 2`, which means its value has already been adjusted by subtracting 2 from it. This does not change due to the execution of `i += 1`.
- The value of `i` is increased by 1. Without knowing the initial value of `i`, we can only say that `i` is now 1 more than it was before.

So, after the code `i += 1` is executed:
- `n` remains `n - 2`, as its value was given in a state before the code execution and the code does not modify `n`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is the old value of `i` plus 1.

Therefore, the Output State, considering all details provided and adhering strictly to the format required, is:
Output State: **`n` is `n - 2`, `i` is increased by 1**
