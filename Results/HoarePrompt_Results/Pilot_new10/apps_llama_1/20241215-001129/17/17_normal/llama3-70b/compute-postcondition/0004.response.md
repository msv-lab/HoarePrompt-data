The given code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement simply prints the number 1 to the console and does not modify any variables.

The initial state is: `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are non-negative integers, and `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`. Since the code does not modify any of these variables, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are non-negative integers, `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, and the number 1 has been printed**
