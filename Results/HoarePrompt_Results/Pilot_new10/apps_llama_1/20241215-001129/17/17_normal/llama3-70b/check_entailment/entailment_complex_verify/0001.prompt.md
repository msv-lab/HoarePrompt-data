You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1

Output
1

Input

Output

Input

4

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt3 > cnt1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, if we have `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 1`, the program will print `1` (because `cnt3` is not greater than `cnt1`), but it is actually impossible to form a regular bracket sequence with the strings ")(" and "))". 

When `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 1`, the program should print `0`, because there is no possible way to arrange ")(" and "))" to form a regular bracket sequence. 

The condition `cnt3 > cnt1` does not cover all possible cases where it is impossible to form a regular bracket sequence. The program should also check for other conditions such as `cnt1 + cnt2 < cnt3 + cnt4`, which is a necessary condition to form a regular bracket sequence.

For example, a corrected version of the program could be:

```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 + cnt2 < cnt3 + cnt4 or cnt3 > cnt1 + cnt2:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
```

This corrected version checks both conditions: `cnt1 + cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4` and `cnt3 <= cnt1 + cnt2`, ensuring that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence with the given strings.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four non-negative integers, cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, where cnt_1 represents the number of strings "((", cnt_2 represents the number of strings "()", cnt_3 represents the number of strings ")(", and cnt_4 represents the number of strings "))".
def func():
    cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4 = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if (cnt3 > cnt1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are non-negative integers. If `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, then 0 has been printed. Otherwise, `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, and the number 1 has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four non-negative integers representing counts of "((", "()", ")((", and "))", and returns 1 if the count of "((" is greater than or equal to the count of ")((", indicating potential balance, and 0 otherwise

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
