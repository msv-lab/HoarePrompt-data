The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that these variables are defined and accessible within the function. 

The function `func` utilizes the non-negative integers cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 representing the counts of the bracket sequences "(", "()", ")(", and ")" respectively. 

Since no specific output conditions (such as Case_1, Case_2, etc.) are provided in the task description, and no return values are mentioned, the description of the functionality will be based solely on the information about the input parameters.


Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to utilize the non-negative integers cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 representing counts of specific bracket sequences.
Functionality: **The function utilizes four non-negative integers representing the counts of specific bracket sequences.**
