You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program correctly checks if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by ordering the given strings. The condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` ensures that the total number of opening brackets equals the total number of closing brackets, which is a necessary condition for a regular bracket sequence.

The additional condition `cnt2 >= cnt3` ensures that there are enough strings of the form "()" to balance out the strings of the form ")(". This is because each string of the form ")(" requires a corresponding string of the form "()" to balance it, and there may not be enough strings of the form "((" to provide the necessary opening brackets.

The program checks these conditions and prints 1 if they are met, indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence, and 0 otherwise.

This solution is correct because it accurately implements the necessary conditions for forming a regular bracket sequence from the given strings. If the conditions are met, it is possible to order the strings in a way that results in a regular bracket sequence, and if the conditions are not met, it is not possible. The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each one. 

For instance, consider the example where `cnt1 = 3`, `cnt2 = 1`, `cnt3 = 4`, and `cnt4 = 3`. In this case, `cnt1 + cnt2 = 4` and `cnt3 + cnt4 = 7`, so the condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` is not met. However, the condition `cnt2 >= cnt3` is also not met. As a result, the program correctly prints 1, indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence. 

In another example where `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 2`, `cnt3 = 3`, and `cnt4 = 4`, the condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` is not met, so the program correctly prints 0.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of the bracket sequences "(", "()", ")(", and ")" respectively, denoted by cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, such that 0 <= cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, cnt_4 <= 10^9.
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if (cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(0)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are input integers. If the sum of `cnt1` and `cnt2` equals the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4`, and `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt_3`, then the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, the value 0 has been printed and returned as output, indicating that either the sums are not equal or `cnt2` is less than `cnt_3`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
