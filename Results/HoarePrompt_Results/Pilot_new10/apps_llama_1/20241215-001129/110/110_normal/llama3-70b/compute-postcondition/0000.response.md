The given code updates the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into four integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` respectively.

Since the input is not specified, the output state will be the updated values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` as input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are input integers, `n` and `m` can be any integers, `r` can be any integer and `k` can be any integer**
