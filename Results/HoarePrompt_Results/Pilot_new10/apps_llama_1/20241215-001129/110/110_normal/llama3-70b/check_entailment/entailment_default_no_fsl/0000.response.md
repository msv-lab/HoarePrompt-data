Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The calculation of `ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` and then printing `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` does not take into account how the fishes are distributed to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

The problem asks to place `k` fishes in the pond to maximize the expected number of caught fishes when a square scoop of size `r` is thrown randomly. However, the provided code simply calculates the minimum between `k` and the number of possible positions for the scoop, and then divides it by the total number of possible positions. This does not ensure that the fishes are placed optimally to maximize the expected catch.

For example, consider a case where `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, and `k = 4`. The code would calculate `ans = min(4, (3-2+1)*(3-2+1)) = min(4, 1) = 1`, and then print `1 / 1 = 1.0`. However, the optimal placement of fishes would be to place them in a way that maximizes the overlap with the scoop, which would result in a higher expected catch.

The code does not consider the actual distribution of fishes in the pond and how it affects the expected catch when the scoop is thrown. Therefore, it does not solve the problem as described.
