Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem asks to maximize the expected number of caught fishes, which can be achieved by spreading the fishes uniformly throughout the pond. However, the program simply calculates the minimum of `k` and the area of the rectangle with sides `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`, and then divides this minimum value by the area of the rectangle.

The program does not consider the optimal placement of fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. The expected value of caught fishes can be maximized by spreading the `k` fishes uniformly throughout the pond, so that each possible position of the scoop-net has the maximum number of fishes.

In the case where `k` is less than the area of the rectangle, the program simply prints `k / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`. However, this does not take into account the fact that the fishes should be placed in a way that maximizes the expected number of caught fishes.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the expected number of caught fishes by spreading the `k` fishes uniformly throughout the pond, and then dividing by the total number of possible positions of the scoop-net.

Here's a correct approach:

The expected number of caught fishes can be calculated as follows:

- If `k` fishes are placed uniformly throughout the pond, each cell will have `k / (n * m)` fishes on average.
- For each possible position of the scoop-net, the expected number of caught fishes is `r * r * k / (n * m)`.
- Since there are `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)` possible positions for the scoop-net, the expected number of caught fishes per position is `k * r * r / (n * m)`.

So, the correct program should calculate and print `k * r * r / (n * m)`.

Here is a simple example where the provided program does not work as expected:
```python
def func():
    n, m, r, k = 12, 17, 9, 40
    # provided program
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
    # correct program
    print(k * r * r / (n * m))

func()
```
In this case, the provided program prints `40 / ((12 - 9 + 1) * (17 - 9 + 1)) = 40 / 16 = 2.5`, while the correct program prints `40 * 9 * 9 / (12 * 17) = 32.8333333333`, which is the expected output according to the problem description.
