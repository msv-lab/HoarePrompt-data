You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. It simply takes the minimum between the number of fishes `k` and the number of possible positions of the scoop-net `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

A correct approach would involve placing the fishes in a way that maximizes the expected number of caught fishes. This can be done by placing the fishes in a uniform grid, such that each fish is at a distance of `r` from its neighbors. This way, each fish has the maximum chance of being caught by the scoop-net, and the expected number of caught fishes is maximized.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, and `k = 3`. The program outputs `1.0`, but the correct output is `2.0`, which can be achieved by placing the fishes at positions `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`, as shown in the problem description.

Here is a simple explanation of why the program does not work: it does not take into account the size of the scoop-net `r` when calculating the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. It simply divides the minimum between the number of fishes `k` and the number of possible positions of the scoop-net by the number of possible positions of the scoop-net, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

The correct approach should be to divide the number of fishes `k` by the area of the pond and then multiply by the area of the scoop-net, that way we get the expected number of fishes that will be caught.

To get the correct result, the program should be modified to calculate the expected number of caught fishes based on the size of the scoop-net `r` and the number of fishes `k`. 

Here is the correct code:
```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    return k * (r * r) / (n * m)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, r, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5).
def func():
    n, m, r, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
