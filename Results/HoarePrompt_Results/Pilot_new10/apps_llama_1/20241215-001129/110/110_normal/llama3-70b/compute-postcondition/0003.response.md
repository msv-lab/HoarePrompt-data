The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is clear that the function is implicitly designed to operate on the parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. These parameters are integers with specific constraints: `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`, `1 <= r <= min(n, m)`, and `1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5)`. However, without specific return values or cases described for the function's output based on these parameters, we can only describe the function's accepted parameters based on the constraints given.


Functionality: **The function implicitly accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, which are integers constrained by 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5), but the return values or specific functionality based on these parameters are not provided.**
