The `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` line adds a new tuple to the `heap` list. Since `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, the new tuple is `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`. 

Given that `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and `heap` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not changed. The `heap` is updated by adding a new tuple. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and `heap` is a list containing at least two tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, including the new tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and `heap` is a list containing at least two tuples, including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`**
