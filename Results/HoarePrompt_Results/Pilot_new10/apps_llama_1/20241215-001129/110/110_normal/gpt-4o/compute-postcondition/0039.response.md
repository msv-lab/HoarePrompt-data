The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the size of the rectangular pond, `r` is a non-negative integer representing the size of the square scoop, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of fishes. After executing the function body, the function returns the average coverage per position. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the size of a rectangular pond, the size of a square scoop, and the number of fishes, and return the average coverage per position, calculated as the total coverage of the popped cells divided by the total possible positions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, representing the size of the rectangular pond, the size of the square scoop, and the number of fishes, and returns the average coverage per position.**
