The function `coverage` accepts parameters `x` and `y`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x` < `n` and 0 <= `y` < `m`, where `n` and `m` represent the dimensions of the pond. The function also considers the size of the scoop-net `r`, where 1 <= `r` <= min(`n`, `m`). After executing the function body, the function returns the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond, considering the positions `x` and `y`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `coverage` is to accept the position of the scoop-net (`x`, `y`) within a pond of size `n` x `m`, and the size of the scoop-net `r`, and return the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, representing the position of the scoop-net within a pond of size n x m, and returns the area of overlap between the scoop-net of size r and the pond.**
