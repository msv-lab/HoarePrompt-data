To calculate the output state, we need to break down the given expression and understand the impact of each variable and operation on the result.

The expression is: `(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))`

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are integers such that `0 <= x < n` and `0 <= y < m`.
- `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers representing the dimensions of the pond and the scoop-net, where `n` and `m` represent the size of the pond, and `r` represents the size of the scoop-net.
- `1 <= n, m <= 10^5` and `1 <= r <= min(n, m)`.

Let's simplify the expression step by step:

1. `min(x + 1, n - r + 1)`:
   - This part of the expression ensures that we do not exceed the pond's boundaries in the x-direction.
   - The minimum between `x + 1` (considering the position of `x` and adding 1 to include the next possible position) and `n - r + 1` (the maximum position that can be reached with a scoop-net of size `r` without exceeding the pond's boundary) is taken.

2. `max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)`:
   - This part adjusts the starting point in the x-direction, considering the size of the scoop-net.
   - `x - r + 1 + 1` adjusts for the scoop-net's size (`r`) and adds 1 to account for the inclusive nature of the range.
   - `max` with `0` ensures that even if `x - r + 1 + 1` is negative (which would happen if `x` is less than `r`), the result is `0`, effectively setting the start of the range to `0` when `x` is close to the edge and the scoop-net would extend beyond the pond's boundary.

3. The same logic applies to the y-direction with `min(y + 1, m - r + 1)` and `max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0)`.

Given these considerations, the expression calculates the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond, considering the positions `x` and `y` and the sizes `n`, `m`, and `r`. It essentially computes the number of positions within the scoop-net's area that overlap with the pond at the specified `x` and `y` coordinates.

The program returns the product of two values, each representing the effective range in the x and y directions that the scoop-net can cover without exceeding the pond's boundaries, adjusted for the scoop-net's size and position.

Output State: **The program returns the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond, considering the positions x and y and the sizes n, m, and r, which is a product of two values representing the effective ranges in the x and y directions.**
