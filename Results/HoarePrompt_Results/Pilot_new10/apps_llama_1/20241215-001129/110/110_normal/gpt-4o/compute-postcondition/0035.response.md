The code reduces `total_coverage` by `cov`. Since `total_coverage` initially equals `-2*cov`, after the reduction, `total_coverage` becomes `-2*cov - cov = -3*cov`. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 2, `x` is the x component of the popped tuple, `y` is the y component of the popped tuple, `cov` is the negative coverage of the popped cell, `heap` is a list containing `n*m - 3` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for the remaining cells, `total_coverage` equals `-3*cov`**
