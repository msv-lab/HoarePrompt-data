The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` representing the size of a rectangular pond, the size of a square scoop, and the number of fishes, and returns the average coverage per position, calculated as the total coverage of the `min(k, n*m)` cells with the highest coverage values divided by the total possible positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, but may throw errors or return nonsense values for certain edge cases such as `n`, `m`, or `r` being 0, or `r` being greater than `n` or `m`.
