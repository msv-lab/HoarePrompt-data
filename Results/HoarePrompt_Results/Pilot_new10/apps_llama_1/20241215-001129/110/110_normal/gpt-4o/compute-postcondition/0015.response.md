To determine the output state, let's first understand what `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` does. 

1. `coverage(x, y)` is a function call that returns a value based on `x` and `y`. Since `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, `coverage(x, y)` is equivalent to `coverage(1, 2)`.
2. The negative of the result, `-coverage(1, 2)`, becomes the first element of the tuple to be pushed onto the heap. This is because in Python's heapq, tuples are ordered by their first element. Making this value negative is likely intended to invert the order, since Python's heapq module only provides a min heap, and this allows the largest coverage value to be treated as the smallest.
3. `x` (which is 1) and `y` (which is 2) are the second and third elements of the tuple, respectively.

Given that `heap` initially contains at least three tuples, after pushing a new tuple onto it, `heap` will contain at least four tuples.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, `y`) are not modified by this operation, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and `heap` is a list containing at least four tuples, with the additional tuple being `(-coverage(1, 2), 1, 2)`**
