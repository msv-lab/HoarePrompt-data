According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `m`. If `y` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is 1, and `heap` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`**
