The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the tuple with the smallest -coverage value from the heap and assigns the -coverage value to `cov`, the x component to `x`, and the y component to `y`. 

The value of `cov` becomes the negative coverage of the popped cell, and the values of `x` and `y` become the x and y components of the popped cell respectively.

The states of the other variables are not affected except for `heap` which now contains `n*m - 3` tuples.

The `total_coverage` is still equal to `-2*cov`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 2, `x` is the x component of the popped tuple, `y` is the y component of the popped tuple, `cov` is the negative coverage of the popped cell, `heap` is a list containing `n*m - 3` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for the remaining cells, `total_coverage` equals `-2*cov`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 2, `x` is the x component of the popped tuple, `y` is the y component of the popped tuple, `cov` is the negative coverage of the popped cell, `heap` is a list containing `n*m - 3` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for the remaining cells, `total_coverage` equals `-2*cov`**
