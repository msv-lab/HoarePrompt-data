To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `r` is a non-negative integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `y` is `m - 1` if `m` is greater than 0, `y` is undefined if `m` is 0
- `x` is 1
- `heap` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m - 1` if `m` is greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list if `m` is 0

Loop statement:
```python
for y in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `y` needs to take on values from 0 to `m - 1`. This implies that `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute more than once (or at all, since if `m` is 0, the loop body will not execute). Since `y` will start at 0 and end at `m - 1`, we need to ensure that the initial state of `y` and other dependent variables are properly set for the loop to commence.

Adjusted state:
- Since `m` needs to be at least 1 for any execution of the loop, we adjust `m` to be greater than 0.
- Given `m` is greater than 0, `y` should initially be 0 for the loop to start correctly, as the loop iterates over `range(m)`.
- `x` remains as 1, as there's no direct dependency on `x` for the loop to execute.
- `heap` should contain at least one tuple since `m` is greater than 0, supporting the loop's execution.
- `n`, `r`, and `k` are non-negative integers, but their values do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, considering the loop needs to execute, the adjusted states are:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and `heap` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`**
