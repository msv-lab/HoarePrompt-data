According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states of `n`, `m`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `heap`, and `total_coverage` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but their values are defined. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not store any value after the loop iteration. 

However, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. If `k` is 0, the loop body will not be executed. Since `x` and `y` are defined based on `n` and `m`, and `heap` is also defined based on `n` and `m`, these states should remain as they are, but with the understanding that `k` must be positive for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0 and undefined if `n` is 0, `y` is `m-1` if `m` is greater than 0 and undefined if `m` is 0, `heap` is a list containing `n*m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` if `n` and `m` are greater than 0, or an empty list if `n` or `m` is 0, and `total_coverage` is 0**
