You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by considering the range of possible votes from the unknown persons.
- It then checks the conditions for a certain outcome:
  - If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, it prints '-' because there's no way to get more upvotes than downvotes.
  - If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints '+' because there's no way to get more downvotes than upvotes.
  - Otherwise, it prints '?' to indicate that the result is uncertain because there are multiple possible outcomes depending on how the unknown persons vote.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- When there are no unknown votes (z = 0), it correctly determines the outcome based on the number of upvotes and downvotes.
- When there are unknown votes, it correctly checks for the possibility of different outcomes and prints '?' if there's uncertainty.
- It also correctly handles edge cases such as when x, y, or z are 0.

The provided examples in the problem description demonstrate the program's correctness, and there are no obvious cases where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but it is implied that there are three non-negative integers x, y, z where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) :
        print('-')
    else :
        if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) :
            print('+')
        else :
            print('?')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `y + z` is less than `x`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, a '?' has been printed and `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x + z` is less than `y`, a string '-' has been returned. Otherwise, if `y + z` is less than `x`, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, a '?' has been printed and `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three non-negative integers x, y, z as input from the user, representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes respectively, calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes, and prints '+' if upvotes will definitely win, '-' if downvotes will definitely win, and '?' if the outcome is uncertain, without validating the input range or type.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
