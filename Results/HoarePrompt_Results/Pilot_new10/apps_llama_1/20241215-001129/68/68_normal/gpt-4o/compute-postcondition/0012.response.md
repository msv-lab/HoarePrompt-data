Postcondition: **`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `y + z` is less than `x`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, a '?' has been printed and `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
