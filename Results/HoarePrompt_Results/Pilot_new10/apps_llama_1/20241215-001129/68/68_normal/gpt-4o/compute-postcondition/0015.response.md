The function `func` accepts no arguments but takes three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, `z` as input from the user, representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes respectively, where `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`. 

Looking at the code line by line, we see that it calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the input values. 

Then, it checks two conditions: 
- If the maximum possible upvotes (`x + z`) are less than the minimum possible downvotes (`y`), it prints a `-` indicating that the downvotes will definitely outnumber the upvotes. 
- If the maximum possible downvotes (`y + z`) are less than the minimum possible upvotes (`x`), it prints a `+` indicating that the upvotes will definitely outnumber the downvotes. 
- In all other cases, it prints a `?` indicating that the outcome is uncertain because the upvotes and downvotes could go either way depending on the unknown votes.

The code does not handle cases where the input values are not integers or are outside the range `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`. It also assumes that the user will always provide three values when prompted.

Functionality: ** The function takes three non-negative integers x, y, z as input from the user, representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes respectively, calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes, and prints '+' if upvotes will definitely win, '-' if downvotes will definitely win, and '?' if the outcome is uncertain, without validating the input range or type. **
