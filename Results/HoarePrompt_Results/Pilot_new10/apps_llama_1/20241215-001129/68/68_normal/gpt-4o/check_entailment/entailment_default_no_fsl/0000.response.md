Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the votes based on the given problem description. 

Here's why the code works:

- It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by considering the cases where all unknown votes go to either upvotes or downvotes.
- It then checks the conditions for each possible outcome:
  - If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, it prints '-' because downvotes will definitely win.
  - If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints '+' because upvotes will definitely win.
  - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that there are scenarios where upvotes can win and scenarios where downvotes can win, so the outcome is uncertain, and it prints '?'.

The code correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description:

- For the input (3, 7, 0), it prints '-' as expected.
- For the input (2, 0, 1), it prints '+' as expected.
- For the input (1, 1, 0), it prints '0' as expected.
- For the input (0, 0, 1), it prints '?' as expected.

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality. The code does not require input validation because the problem statement guarantees that the inputs are non-negative integers.

Overall, the code correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the votes based on the given problem description, and it handles all the provided examples correctly.
