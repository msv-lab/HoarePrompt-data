Postcondition: **`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, and 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. The maximum number of upvotes is greater than or equal to the minimum number of downvotes, meaning `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, or equivalently, `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`. The current value of `max_downvotes` is less than the current value of `min_upvotes`, meaning `y + z` is less than `x`.**
