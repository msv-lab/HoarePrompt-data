`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100.
