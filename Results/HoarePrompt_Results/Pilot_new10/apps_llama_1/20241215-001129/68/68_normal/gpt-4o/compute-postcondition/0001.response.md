The code assigns the value of `x` to `min_upvotes`. The initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, `z` are input integers where `x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes. The values of `y` and `z` are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100**
