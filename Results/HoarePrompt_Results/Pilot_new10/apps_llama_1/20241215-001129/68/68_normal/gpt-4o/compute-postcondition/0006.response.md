The given code snippet only contains a print statement that outputs a hyphen (-). This operation does not affect the values of any variables. 

The initial state is: 
- `x` is the number of upvotes
- `y` is the number of downvotes
- `z` is the number of unknown votes
- `min_upvotes` equals `x`
- `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`
- `min_downvotes` equals `y`
- `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`
- 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100
- The current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`, implying that `x + z` is less than `y`.

Since the code does not change the values of any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that a string '-' has been returned at the output.

Output State: **`x` is the number of upvotes, `y` is the number of downvotes, `z` is the number of unknown votes, `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, `min_downvotes` equals `y`, `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`, 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x + z` is less than `y`, and a string '-' has been returned at the output.**
