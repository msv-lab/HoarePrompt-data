Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, representing the number of people who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`. The current value of `z` is 0, which implies that `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and since `x` is equal to `y`, the current values of `x` and `y` must be equal and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and 0 (which means `x` equals `y`), so `x` equals `y`.**
