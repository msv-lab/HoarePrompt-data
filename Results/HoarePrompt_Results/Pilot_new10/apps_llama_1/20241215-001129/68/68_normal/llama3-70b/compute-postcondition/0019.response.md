The function `func` accepts three implicit non-negative integers `x`, `y`, `z` as input, each less than or equal to 100, where `x` represents the number of upvotes, `y` represents the number of downvotes, and `z` represents the number of votes with unknown outcomes.

The code checks the following conditions:
- If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'.
- If `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, it further checks:
  - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'.
  - If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it then checks:
    - If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, it prints '0'.
    - In all other cases where `x` is greater than or equal to `y` (including when `x` equals `y` but `z` is not 0, and when `x` is greater than `y`), it prints '?'.

This logic covers all potential cases based on the comparisons between `x`, `y`, and `z`. The function does not handle any explicit error cases for invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers or numbers greater than 100), implying it expects the inputs to always be within the specified range.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three implicit non-negative integers x, y, z, each less than or equal to 100, representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively, and prints '+' if upvotes exceed the sum of downvotes and unknown votes, '-' if upvotes are less than downvotes, '0' if upvotes equal downvotes and there are no unknown votes, and '?' in all other cases. **
