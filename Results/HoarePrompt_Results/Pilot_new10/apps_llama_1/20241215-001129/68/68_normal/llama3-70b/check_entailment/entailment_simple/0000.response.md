Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description in all cases. 

The issue lies in the condition where `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but not equal to `y`. In this case, the program prints a '?' without considering the value of `z`. 

According to the problem description, if `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and `y + z` is less than or equal to `x`, the result should be '+'. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is `2 0 1`, the program should print '+', but it will print '?' because it does not check if `x + z` is greater than `y`. 

The correct program should check all possible outcomes of the unknown votes and determine if the result is certain or uncertain.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y - z:
        print('-')
    elif x == y and z == 0:
        print('0')
    elif x + z < y or x > y + z:
        print('?' if z > 0 else ('+' if x > y else '-'))
    else:
        print('?')
```

This program checks all possible outcomes of the unknown votes and determines if the result is certain or uncertain. If the result is certain, it prints the corresponding symbol; otherwise, it prints '?'.
