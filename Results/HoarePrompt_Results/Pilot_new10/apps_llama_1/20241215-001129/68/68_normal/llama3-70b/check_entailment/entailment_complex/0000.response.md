Correctness: **False**

The program does not entirely follow the problem description. According to the problem description, the result should be uncertain (denoted by "?") if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

However, the program only checks for specific conditions and does not fully consider the scenarios where the result could be uncertain. 

For instance, if `x` is greater than `y` but less than `y + z`, the program should print "?" because the outcome is uncertain (the unknown votes could either make the upvotes win or lead to a tie). But the current implementation only checks if `x` equals `y` and if `z` is 0, and prints "?" only in those specific cases.

The correct program should be more comprehensive in handling the conditions for uncertainty. It should check if there's a possibility for the unknown votes to change the outcome, regardless of whether `x` equals `y` or not.

Here is an example where the program does not follow the problem description:
Input: `x = 5`, `y = 3`, `z = 3`. In this case, the program will print "?" because `x` is not greater than `y + z`, and `x` is not less than `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. However, this is a correct outcome because the result is indeed uncertain: if all unknown votes are upvotes, the result is "+"; if all unknown votes are downvotes, the result is "-".

However, another example where the program fails to follow the problem description is when `x = 4`, `y = 3`, `z = 2`. In this case, if both unknown votes are downvotes, the result is "0" (4 upvotes, 5 downvotes is not true, 4 upvotes, 5 downvotes means downvotes win), but if one or both unknown votes are upvotes, the result is "+". Since there are two possible outcomes, the result should be "?", but the current program does not handle this scenario correctly.

Therefore, the program does not meet all the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is **False**. 

To fix this, the program needs to be enhanced to correctly identify all scenarios where the outcome is uncertain due to the unknown votes. This involves checking if the difference between `x` and `y` is less than `z`, indicating that the unknown votes could potentially change the outcome, making the result uncertain. 

Here is an example of how the corrected program could look:
```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y - z:
        print('-')
    elif x == y and z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
```
This corrected version checks if `x` is greater than `y + z` (meaning upvotes win regardless of unknown votes), if `x` is less than `y - z` (meaning downvotes win regardless of unknown votes), or if `x` equals `y` and there are no unknown votes (meaning the result is a tie). In all other cases, it prints "?" to indicate an uncertain outcome.
