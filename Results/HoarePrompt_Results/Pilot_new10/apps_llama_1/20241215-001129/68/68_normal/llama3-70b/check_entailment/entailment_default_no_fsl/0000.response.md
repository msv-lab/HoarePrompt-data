Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the conditions and how the code handles them:

- If `x > y + z`, it means that even if all unknown votes `z` go to downvotes, upvotes `x` will still be more than downvotes `y + z`. The code correctly prints '+' in this case.

- If `x < y`, it means that downvotes are more than upvotes, regardless of how the unknown votes are distributed. The code correctly prints '-' in this case.

- If `x == y` and `z == 0`, it means that upvotes and downvotes are equal, and there are no unknown votes, so the result is '0'. The code correctly handles this case.

- If `x == y` but `z > 0`, the outcome could be '0' if the unknown votes split equally between up and down, or it could tip the balance to either '+' or '-' depending on how the unknown votes are cast. Since the outcome is uncertain, the code correctly prints '?'.

- For all other cases where `x > y` but `x <= y + z`, or `x < y` but `x + z > y`, the outcome is uncertain because the distribution of unknown votes can change the result. The code handles these cases by printing '?'.

The examples provided in the problem description also match the expected output of the code. For instance:

- Input `3 7 0` results in '-', which is correct because downvotes exceed upvotes.
- Input `2 0 1` results in '+', which is correct because even if the unknown vote goes to down, upvotes still exceed downvotes.
- Input `1 1 0` results in '0', which is correct because upvotes and downvotes are equal, and there are no unknown votes.
- Input `0 0 1` results in '?', which is correct because the outcome depends on how the unknown vote is cast.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it seems that the code correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
