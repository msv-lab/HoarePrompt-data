You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines the outcome of Nauuo's comment based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `x > y + z`, it means that even if all unknown voters downvote, the number of upvotes will still be greater than the number of downvotes. In this case, the program correctly prints '+'.

2. If `x < y`, it means that there are already more downvotes than upvotes, and the unknown voters cannot change this outcome. In this case, the program correctly prints '-'.

3. If `x == y`, the outcome depends on the unknown voters. If `z == 0`, it means there are no unknown voters, and the outcome is a tie ('0'). If `z > 0`, the outcome is uncertain ('?').

4. In all other cases, the program prints '?' to indicate an uncertain outcome.

The program correctly handles all possible combinations of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, and produces the expected output for the provided examples. After analyzing the program and the problem statement, no cases were found where the program does not work as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three non-negative integers x, y, z, each less than or equal to 100, representing the number of people who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, `x` equals `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `z` is 0, a value `0` has been printed. If `z` is greater than 0, a '?' has been printed to the console.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` equals `y`, then if `z` is 0, a value `0` has been printed, otherwise a '?' has been printed. If `x` does not equal `y`, then a '?' has been printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen has been printed to the console. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, a value `0` has been printed; otherwise, a '?' has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, representing the number of people who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, then '+' has been printed. If `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, then if `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen has been printed; otherwise, if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, a value `0` has been printed; otherwise, a '?' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three implicit non-negative integers x, y, z, each less than or equal to 100, representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively, and prints '+' if upvotes exceed the sum of downvotes and unknown votes, '-' if upvotes are less than downvotes, '0' if upvotes equal downvotes and there are no unknown votes, and '?' in all other cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
