To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables. The code updates the value of `max_jump` based on the difference between the current index `i` and the last vowel index `last_vowel`. 

Given that `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, and `i` is 1, we can analyze the effect of the code.

However, we notice that `last_vowel` and `max_jump` are not defined in the initial state. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume that `last_vowel` and `max_jump` have been previously defined and are accessible within the context of this code snippet. 

The code calculates `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` and updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the calculated value. Since `i` is 1, the calculation depends on the value of `last_vowel`. 

Without knowing the exact value of `last_vowel` and the initial value of `max_jump`, we cannot determine the exact value of `max_jump` after the calculation. However, we can describe the output state based on the given information:

- `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` remains 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` remains the length of `s` and is greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `(1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which depends on the value of `last_vowel`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.**
