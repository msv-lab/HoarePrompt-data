You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

Program:

    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel != n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    print(max_jump)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One example where the program fails is when the input string consists of only vowels, and the string length is greater than 1. In this case, the program should return 1, as the grasshopper can jump to any vowel. However, the program returns a value greater than 1.

The issue with the program is that it calculates the maximum jump as the maximum of the maximum jump and the distance between two vowels divided by 2 plus 1. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where the grasshopper can jump directly to the next vowel.

For example, if the input string is "AAAA", the program should return 1, but it returns 2. This is because the program calculates the maximum jump as the maximum of 1 and (1 - 0) // 2 + 1, which is 2.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly calculate the maximum jump. One possible approach is to iterate through the string and keep track of the maximum distance between two vowels. The maximum jump is then the maximum of this distance and 1.

Here is an example of a corrected program:
```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 1
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel!= -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i - last_vowel)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel!= n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, n - last_vowel)
    print(max_jump)
```
This corrected program calculates the maximum jump as the maximum of the maximum distance between two vowels and the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. It correctly handles the case where the input string consists of only vowels.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels, and `max_jump` is the maximum possible jump between two vowels in `s` or 0 if `s` does not contain any vowels.
    if (last_vowel != n - 1) :
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`. If the last character of `s` is not a vowel, then `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels, and `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. If the last character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` and `max_jump` retain their previous values.
    print(max_jump)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100 as input, calculates the maximum possible jump between two vowels in the string, and prints the result, considering the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string if the last character is not a vowel, or returns 0 if the string does not contain any vowels.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
