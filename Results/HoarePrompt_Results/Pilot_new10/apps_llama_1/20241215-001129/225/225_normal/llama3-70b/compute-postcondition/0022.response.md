The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. We know that `i` is 2, and if `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `last_vowel` is 2. 

If `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `last_vowel` is 2. So `(i - last_vowel)` is 0. Therefore, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `(0) // 2 + 1`, which is 1. 

If `s[i]` is not in `vowels`, then `last_vowel` is not 2. We know that `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. Since `last_vowel` is less than `i`, `last_vowel` can be either 0 or 1. 

If `last_vowel` is 0, then `(i - last_vowel)` is 2. Therefore, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `(2) // 2 + 1`, which is 2. 

If `last_vowel` is 1, then `(i - last_vowel)` is 1. Therefore, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `(1) // 2 + 1`, which is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `last_vowel` is 2 and `max_jump` is at least 1, else `max_jump` is at least the maximum of its previous value and ((2 - `last_vowel`) // 2 + 1), which can be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `last_vowel`.**
