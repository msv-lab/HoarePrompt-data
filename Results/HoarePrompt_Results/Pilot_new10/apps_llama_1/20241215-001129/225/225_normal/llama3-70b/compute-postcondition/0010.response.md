To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
   - `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
   - `max_jump` is 0.
   - `last_vowel` is not equal to -1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The current character of `s` at index `i` is a vowel.

2. **Given Code**:
   ```
   max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
   ```
   This line of code updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `i` is 0 and represents the current index in the string `s`, and given that the character at this index is a vowel, `last_vowel` must also be 0 because `i` and `last_vowel` both refer to the index of a vowel in `s`, and `i` is the starting point (0).
   - Therefore, `i - last_vowel` equals 0 because both `i` and `last_vowel` are 0.
   - The expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` simplifies to `(0) // 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - Since `max_jump` is initially 0, `max(max_jump, 1)` will be 1.
   - Thus, `max_jump` is updated to 1.

4. **Output State**:
   - `s` remains a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
   - `vowels` remains 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` remains the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
   - `max_jump` is now 1.
   - `last_vowel` remains not equal to -1, specifically 0 in this context.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - The current character of `s` at index `i` remains a vowel.

**Output State: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current character of `s` at index `i` is a vowel.**
