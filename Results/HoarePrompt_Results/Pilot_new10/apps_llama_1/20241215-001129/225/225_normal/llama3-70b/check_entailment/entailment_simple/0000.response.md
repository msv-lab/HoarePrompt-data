Correctness: **False**

The program does not always do what the problem description says. The issue lies in the line where the program updates `max_jump` inside the for loop: `max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`.

According to the problem description, the jump ability is the maximum possible length of the jump to a vowel from the current position. However, the line of code mentioned above calculates the maximum jump as `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which is incorrect.

The correct way to calculate the maximum jump would be to take the maximum distance between the current vowel and the next vowel, or between the current vowel and the end of the string if there are no more vowels.

Here's an example where the program fails:

Input: `AAB`

The program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2`, because the grasshopper needs to jump 2 characters to reach the end of the string from the last vowel.

A correct implementation would be:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel!= -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i - last_vowel)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel!= -1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, n - last_vowel)
    else:
        max_jump = n
    print(max_jump)
```

This corrected implementation calculates the maximum jump by taking the maximum distance between the current vowel and the next vowel, or between the current vowel and the end of the string if there are no more vowels. If there are no vowels in the string, the maximum jump is set to the length of the string.
