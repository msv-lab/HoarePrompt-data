The value of `last_vowel` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 1. If `max_jump` was at least 2 when `last_vowel` was -1, then `max_jump` is at least 2. Otherwise, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` which equals `(1 - 1) // 2 + 1` equals `1`. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 1, `max_jump` is at least 1**
