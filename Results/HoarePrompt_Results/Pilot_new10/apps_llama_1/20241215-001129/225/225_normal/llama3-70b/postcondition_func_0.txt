The function takes a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100 as input, calculates the maximum possible jump between two vowels in the string, and prints the result, considering the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string if the last character is not a vowel, or returns 0 if the string does not contain any vowels.
