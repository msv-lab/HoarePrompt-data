You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output

Input
AAA

Output

Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel != n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    print(max_jump)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the far end of the string. 

One case where the program fails is when the string consists of a single character that is a vowel. In this case, the program should output 1, but the current logic calculates `max_jump` as `max(max_jump, (i + 1))`, which is correct. However, if the input string has a single vowel character, it should return 1 as the minimum jump ability. But if the string has only one character and it is not a vowel, the program will still return 0 as it will not enter the if condition. 

However, the main issue arises when there are no vowels in the string. In this case, the program does not update `max_jump` and `last_vowel` remains -1, resulting in an incorrect calculation for the last jump.

Another case where the program fails is when there are multiple consecutive vowels. In this case, the program calculates the jump ability as `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which is incorrect because the Grasshopper can jump to any of the consecutive vowels. The program should consider the maximum distance between any two vowels, not just the distance between the current vowel and the previous one.

For example, if the input string is "AAAB", the program should output 1, but if the string is "ABAA", the program should also output 1, because the Grasshopper can jump to any of the consecutive 'A's.

The correct program should consider all these cases and calculate the minimum jump ability accordingly. 

Here is a possible correct solution:
```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    positions = [i for i, x in enumerate(s) if x in vowels]
    if not positions:
        print(n)
        return
    if positions[0]!= 0:
        positions.insert(0, -1)
    if positions[-1]!= n - 1:
        positions.append(n)
    max_jump = 0
    for i in range(1, len(positions)):
        max_jump = max(max_jump, positions[i] - positions[i-1])
    print(max_jump)

func()
```
This solution first finds all the positions of the vowels in the string and then calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels. If there are no vowels in the string, it outputs the length of the string. If the first character is not a vowel, it adds -1 to the list of positions. If the last character is not a vowel, it adds the length of the string to the list of positions. Then it calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive positions and prints the result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels, and `max_jump` is the maximum possible jump between two vowels in `s` or 0 if `s` does not contain any vowels.
    if (last_vowel != n - 1) :
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`. If the last character of `s` is not a vowel, then `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels, and `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. If the last character of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` and `max_jump` retain their previous values.
    print(max_jump)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100 as input, calculates the maximum possible jump between two vowels in the string, and prints the result, considering the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string if the last character is not a vowel, or returns 0 if the string does not contain any vowels.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
