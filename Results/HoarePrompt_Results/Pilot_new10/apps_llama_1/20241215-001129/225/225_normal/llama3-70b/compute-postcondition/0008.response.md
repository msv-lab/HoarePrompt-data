The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (0) and `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `max_jump` becomes the maximum of 0 and 1, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `max_jump` is 1, the current value of `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current character of `s` at index `i` is a vowel.**
