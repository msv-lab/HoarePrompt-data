To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

1. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100.
2. `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
3. `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`.
4. `prev_pos` is the position of the last vowel in `s` if `s` contains vowels, otherwise it is -1.

Given the code `return max_jump`, we need to understand what `max_jump` represents in the context of the initial state.

- If `s` contains vowels, `prev_pos` will be the position of the last vowel in `s`. Therefore, `len(s) - prev_pos` will give the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
- If `s` does not contain vowels, `prev_pos` is -1, making `len(s) - prev_pos` equal to `len(s) + 1`, since `len(s)` is a positive integer (because `s` is non-empty) and subtracting -1 is equivalent to adding 1.

`max_jump` is then the maximum of its previous value (which is not specified but implied to be updated based on `len(s) - prev_pos`) and `len(s) - prev_pos`. Since we are looking at the return statement without the context of how `max_jump` is previously updated or initialized, we can infer that `max_jump` will be at least `len(s) - prev_pos` after the last update.

Given that `s` has a length not exceeding 100 and considering the two scenarios:
- If `s` contains vowels, `max_jump` could be any value from 0 (if the last vowel is at the end of the string) up to `len(s) - 1` (if the last vowel is at the beginning of the string), assuming `prev_pos` is updated correctly to reflect the last vowel's position.
- If `s` does not contain vowels, `max_jump` would be at least `len(s) + 1`, considering `prev_pos` is -1.

However, without explicit information on how `max_jump` is initialized or updated before this point, the most accurate description based on the given initial state and the nature of the variables involved is that `max_jump` will return a value that represents the maximum jump calculated based on the string `s` and its vowels.

Therefore, considering all possible scenarios and the constraints provided:
Output State: **The program returns max_jump, which is the maximum of its previous value and the difference between the length of string `s` and the position of the last vowel in `s` (or -1 if `s` does not contain vowels), reflecting the maximum jump considering the string's length and vowel positions.**
