To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 3.
- `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `i` is 2.

The given code is:
```python
max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
```

From the initial state and the code, we can deduce the following:
- The value of `s` and `vowels` does not change as they are not affected by the given code.
- The value of `i` is 2, which is used in the calculation but `i` itself does not change.
- `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - prev_pos`. However, the initial value of `max_jump` and `prev_pos` are not provided.

Since `prev_pos` is not defined in the initial state, we can't directly calculate the new value of `max_jump`. However, we can express the update rule for `max_jump` based on the given code.

Given that `i` is 2, the update rule for `max_jump` can be written as `max_jump = max(max_jump, 2 - prev_pos)`. Without knowing the initial values of `max_jump` and `prev_pos`, we cannot determine the exact value of `max_jump` after the update.

Therefore, considering the information provided and the updates made by the code, the output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 3.
- `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `i` is 2.
- `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, 2 - prev_pos)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 3, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 2, `max_jump` is `max(max_jump, 2 - prev_pos)`**
