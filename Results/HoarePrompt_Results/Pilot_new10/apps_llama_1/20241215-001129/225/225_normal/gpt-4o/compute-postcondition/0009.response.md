The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`. 

Given that `i` is 1 and `prev_pos` can be either 0 or -1, the value of `i - prev_pos` is either 1 (when `prev_pos` is 0) or 2 (when `prev_pos` is -1). 

The initial value of `max_jump` is 1. 

So, `max_jump` will be updated to the maximum of 1 and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`, which is either 1 or 2. 

Therefore, the new value of `max_jump` will be either 1 (if `prev_pos` is 0) or 2 (if `prev_pos` is -1).

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 2, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 1, if `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `prev_pos` is 0 and `max_jump` is 1, and if `s[i]` is not in `vowels`, then `prev_pos` is -1 and `max_jump` is 2**
