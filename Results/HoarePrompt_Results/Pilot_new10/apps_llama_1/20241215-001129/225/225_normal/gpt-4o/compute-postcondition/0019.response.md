The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100. The function returns `max_jump`, which represents the maximum jump considering the string's length and vowel positions. This `max_jump` is determined by taking the maximum of its previous value and the difference between the length of string `s` and the position of the last vowel in `s`, or -1 if `s` does not contain vowels.
