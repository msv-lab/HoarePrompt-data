The value of `prev_pos` is updated to `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 2, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1, and if `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `max_jump` is 1, and if `s[i]` is not in `vowels`, then `max_jump` is 2.
