The code `prev_pos = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev_pos`. Given that `i` is 2, `prev_pos` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 3, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is 2, `max_jump` is `max(max_jump, 2 - 2)` which simplifies to `max(max_jump, 0)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 3, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is 2, `max_jump` is `max(max_jump, 0)`**
