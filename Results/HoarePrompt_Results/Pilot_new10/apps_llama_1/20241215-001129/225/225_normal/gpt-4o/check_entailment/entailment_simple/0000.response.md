Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program initializes `max_jump` to 1, which is the minimum possible jump ability.
2. It then iterates over the input string `s`, checking each character to see if it's a vowel. If it is, it updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the distance between the current vowel and the previous vowel (or the start of the string if this is the first vowel).
3. After iterating over the entire string, it updates `max_jump` one more time to be the maximum of its current value and the distance between the end of the string and the last vowel (or the start of the string if there are no vowels).
4. Finally, it returns `max_jump`, which is the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string by jumping only on vowels.

This logic matches the problem description, which defines the minimum jump ability as the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, or between the last vowel and the end of the string.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If the string contains no vowels, `max_jump` will remain at its initial value of 1, which is the correct minimum jump ability in this case.
* If the string contains only one vowel, `max_jump` will be updated to be the distance between the vowel and the end of the string, which is the correct minimum jump ability in this case.
* If the string contains multiple vowels, `max_jump` will be updated to be the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, which is the correct minimum jump ability in this case.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible input strings.
