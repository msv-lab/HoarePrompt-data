The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between the length of `s` and `prev_pos`. 

If `s` contains vowels, `prev_pos` is the position of the last vowel in `s`, so `len(s) - prev_pos` represents the distance between the last vowel and the end of `s`. 

If `s` does not contain vowels, `prev_pos` is -1, so `len(s) - prev_pos` equals `len(s) + 1`. 

Therefore, `max_jump` becomes the maximum of its current value and the distance between the last vowel (or the start of `s` if `s` does not contain vowels) and the end of `s`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`, and `prev_pos` is the position of the last vowel in `s` if `s` contains vowels, otherwise it is -1.**
