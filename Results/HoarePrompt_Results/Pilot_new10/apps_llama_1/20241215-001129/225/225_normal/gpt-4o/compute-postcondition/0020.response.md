To analyze the functionality of `func_1(s)`, let's break down the code and its annotations step by step.

1. **Input Parameter**: The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `vowels` with capital English vowels (including 'Y'), `max_jump` to 1, and `prev_pos` to -1. The `max_jump` variable is intended to track the maximum distance between two consecutive vowels in the string, and `prev_pos` is used to store the position of the last encountered vowel.

3. **Loop Through String**: The function iterates through each character in the string. If a character is a vowel, it updates `max_jump` with the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current position `i` and the previous vowel position `prev_pos`. It then updates `prev_pos` to the current position `i`.

4. **Post-Loop Update**: After the loop, it updates `max_jump` again with the maximum of its current value and the difference between the length of the string `s` and the last vowel position `prev_pos`. This ensures that the maximum distance also considers the gap from the last vowel to the end of the string.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns `max_jump`, which represents the maximum distance between two consecutive vowels in the string, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if there are vowels, or simply the length of the string plus one (since `prev_pos` is -1 and `max_jump` is initialized to 1) if there are no vowels.

Considering the code and its behavior:

- If the string contains vowels, `max_jump` will correctly calculate the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
- If the string does not contain any vowels, `prev_pos` remains -1, and `max_jump` will be the length of the string plus one (because `max_jump` is initialized to 1 and then updated with the difference between the string length and -1), effectively giving the length of the string as there are no vowels to calculate distance between.

However, based on the code, there seems to be a missing consideration in the annotations and return postconditions regarding what happens when there are no vowels in the string. The functionality as per the code is that it returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, including to the end of the string, or the length of the string plus one if no vowels are found. 

The functionality, therefore, encompasses the calculation of the maximum jump between vowels in a string, including the consideration of the string's end as a boundary if vowels are present, and returns the string's length plus one if no vowels are present.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `s` of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, and returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s`, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, or the length of `s` plus one if `s` does not contain any vowels. **
