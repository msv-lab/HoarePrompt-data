According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the string `s`. If `i` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}. `i` is 0, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, hence `i` is 1. The length of `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 2, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, if `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, and if `s[i]` is not in `vowels`, then `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, and `i` is 1**
