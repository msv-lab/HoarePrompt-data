The value of `operations` is updated by appending a new tuple to the list. The new tuple contains the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the new tuple is `(0 + 1, 1 + 1)` which equals `(1, 2)`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and m is at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50 and m is at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
