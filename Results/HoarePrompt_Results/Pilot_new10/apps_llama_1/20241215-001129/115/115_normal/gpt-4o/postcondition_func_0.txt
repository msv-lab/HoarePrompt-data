The function accepts integers `n` and `m` between 2 and 50, and a 2D list `A` with `n` rows and `m` columns containing 0 or 1, and returns -1 if `A` cannot be transformed into a matrix with all elements set to 1 in 2x2 sub-matrices, otherwise it prints the number of operations and the coordinates of each operation required to transform `A` into the target matrix
