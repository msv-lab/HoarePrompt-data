To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns
- `operations` is a list containing tuples
- `i` is 1
- Either the program has returned -1 (in which case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged), or `A[1]` is equal to `B[1]`

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Since `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, `n` must now be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 2, and either the program has returned -1 (in which case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged), or `A[1]` is equal to `B[1]`**
