The code appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The new tuple contains the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the new tuple is `(2, 2)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[1][2]` equals 1, `B[2][1]` equals 1, and `B[2][2]` equals 1, if `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, `operations` contains the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[1][2]` equals 1, `B[2][1]` equals 1, and `B[2][2]` equals 1, if `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, `operations` contains the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
