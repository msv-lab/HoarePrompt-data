The given code changes the values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` to 1. 

Given `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `B[0][2]`, `B[0][3]`, `B[1][2]`, and `B[1][3]` are set to 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` is still an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the value of `m` is still an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50. 

The 2D list `A` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[0][3]`, `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, and `B[1][3]` are 1, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2**
