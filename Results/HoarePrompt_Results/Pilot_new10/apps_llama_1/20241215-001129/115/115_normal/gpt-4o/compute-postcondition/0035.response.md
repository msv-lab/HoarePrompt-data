The given code affects the 2D list `B`. The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1. The code sets `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, and for `i` = 1, `B[i][j]` equals 1, `B[i][j+1]` equals 1, `B[i+1][j]` equals 1, and `B[i+1][j+1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `B[2][0]` equals 1, `B[2][1]` equals 1, `B[3][0]` equals 1, and `B[3][1]` equals 1**
