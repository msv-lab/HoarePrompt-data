Based on the annotated code and return postconditions provided, the function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`, where `n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, containing either 0 or 1.

The function iterates over the elements of `A`, checking for 2x2 sub-matrices with all elements equal to 1. If such a sub-matrix is found, it marks the corresponding elements in `B` as 1 and records the operation in the `operations` list.

However, the function does not return the `operations` list or the modified `B` matrix. Instead, it checks if `A` is equal to `B` and returns -1 if they are not equal. If `A` and `B` are equal, it prints the number of operations and the coordinates of each operation.

There are several edge cases and potential issues with the function:

* The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are less than 2 or greater than 50.
* The function does not handle cases where `A` contains elements other than 0 or 1.
* The function returns -1 if `A` and `B` are not equal, but it does not provide any information about why they are not equal.
* The function prints the number of operations and the coordinates of each operation, but it does not return this information.

Based on the code, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n` and `m` between 2 and 50, and a 2D list `A` with `n` rows and `m` columns containing 0 or 1, and returns -1 if `A` cannot be transformed into a matrix with all elements set to 1 in 2x2 sub-matrices, otherwise it prints the number of operations and the coordinates of each operation required to transform `A` into the target matrix **
