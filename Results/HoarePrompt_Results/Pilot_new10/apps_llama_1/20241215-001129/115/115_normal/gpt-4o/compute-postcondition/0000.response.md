The code initializes an empty list `operations`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `A`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, and `operations` is an empty list**
