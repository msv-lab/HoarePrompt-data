Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list containing tuples `(1, j+1)` for each such `j`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, meaning `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1.**
