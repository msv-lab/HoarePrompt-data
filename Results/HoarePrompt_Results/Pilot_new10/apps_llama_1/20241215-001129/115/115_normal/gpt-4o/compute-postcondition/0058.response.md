Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
