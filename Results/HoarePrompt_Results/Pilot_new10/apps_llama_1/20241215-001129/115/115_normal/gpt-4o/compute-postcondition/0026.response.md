Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, if `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, if `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[1][2]` equals 1, `B[2][1]` equals 1, and `B[2][2]` equals 1, and `operations` contains the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`, otherwise the state of `B` and `operations` remains the same as initially described in the precondition**
