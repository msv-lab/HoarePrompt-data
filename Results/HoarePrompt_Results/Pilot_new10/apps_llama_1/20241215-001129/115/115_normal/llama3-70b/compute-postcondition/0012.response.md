The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since we are not provided with the loop information, we can conclude that this will not change any variable values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)` if any of the conditions are met, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
