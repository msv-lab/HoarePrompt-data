Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the fact that the code only checks for 2x2 sub-matrices with at least one 1 but not all 1s, and then directly prints the coordinates of these sub-matrices. However, the problem requires a sequence of operations that transforms matrix B into matrix A, where each operation sets a 2x2 sub-matrix to 1.

The code does not consider the case where a 2x2 sub-matrix has only one or two 1s, but the rest of the matrix is such that it cannot be made equal to matrix A by the given operations. For example, in a 3x3 matrix A, if the top-left 2x2 sub-matrix is [[1, 0], [0, 1]], there is no way to make matrix B equal to matrix A because the operations only set 2x2 sub-matrices to 1.

The code also does not check if the resulting matrix B after the operations is indeed equal to matrix A, it simply prints the number and coordinates of the 2x2 sub-matrices with at least one 1 but not all 1s.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The code will print the coordinates of the 2x2 sub-matrices with at least one 1 but not all 1s, but it will not be able to transform matrix B into matrix A because the resulting matrix B will have 1s in different positions than matrix A. The correct output should be -1, indicating that it is impossible to make matrix B equal to matrix A.
