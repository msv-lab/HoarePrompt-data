Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and at least one of the following conditions is true: the current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, or the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, if `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged**
