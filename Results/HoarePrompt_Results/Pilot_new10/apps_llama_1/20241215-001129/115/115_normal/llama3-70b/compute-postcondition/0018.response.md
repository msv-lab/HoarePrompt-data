Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the execution proceeds to the next instruction.***
