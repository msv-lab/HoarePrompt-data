`ops` is appended with the value `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which equals `(0 + 1, 2 + 1)` and that is equal to `(1, 3)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ops` contains the value `(1, 3)`. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we were in the next iteration of the most internal loop before this instruction, but since this code doesn't have loop or if we would proceed to next instruction.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ops` contains the value `(1, 3)`**
