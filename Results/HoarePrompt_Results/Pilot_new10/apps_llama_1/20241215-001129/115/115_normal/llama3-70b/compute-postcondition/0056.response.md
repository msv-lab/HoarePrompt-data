Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, if `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops`. Otherwise, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and no changes were made to `A`, `i`, `j`, except for `ops` now containing `(3, 2)`.**
