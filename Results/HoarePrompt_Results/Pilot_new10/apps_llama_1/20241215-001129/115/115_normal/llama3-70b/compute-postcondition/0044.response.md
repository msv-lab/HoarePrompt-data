The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there's no loop provided in the given code snippet, we'll assume it's part of a larger loop structure that iterates over certain conditions or indices.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement:

- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 1.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `ops` contains specific tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A`.
- The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.

Since `continue` only affects the flow of the loop it's in and not the values of variables directly, and assuming it's part of a loop that might iterate over columns or operations based on `ops`, the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The loop will simply move on to the next iteration, skipping any code that follows the `continue` statement within the same loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers with `A[2][0]` = 1, `A[3][0]` = 1, `A[2][1]` = 1, and `A[3][1]` = 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
