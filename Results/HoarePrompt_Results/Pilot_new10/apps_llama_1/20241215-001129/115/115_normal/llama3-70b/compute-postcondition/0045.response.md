Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A`. If `A[2][0]` = 1, `A[3][0]` = 1, `A[2][1]` = 1, and `A[3][1]` = 1, then we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution proceeds without any changes to `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops`.**
