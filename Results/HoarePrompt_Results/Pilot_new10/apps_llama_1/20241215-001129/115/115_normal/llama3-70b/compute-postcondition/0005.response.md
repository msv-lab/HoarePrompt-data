Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, meaning that the first two elements of the first column and the first two elements of the second column of `A` are all 1.**
