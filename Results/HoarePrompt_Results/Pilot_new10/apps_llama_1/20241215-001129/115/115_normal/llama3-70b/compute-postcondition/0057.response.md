The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `ops` list. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, the tuple appended to `ops` will be `(3, 3)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` including the newly appended tuple `(3, 3)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` including `(3, 2)` and `(3, 3)`**
