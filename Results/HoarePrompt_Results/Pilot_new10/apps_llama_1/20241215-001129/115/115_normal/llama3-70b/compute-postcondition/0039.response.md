Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` contains its original tuples plus a new tuple `(2, 3)`, otherwise the state of `ops` and the program remains unchanged.**
