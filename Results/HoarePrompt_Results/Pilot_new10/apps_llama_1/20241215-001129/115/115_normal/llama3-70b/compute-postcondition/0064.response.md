To determine the output state, let's examine the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every position `(i, j)` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500

Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ops))
```

This code snippet prints the length of `ops`. 

Output State: 
The output of `print(len(ops))` is the length of `ops`, but it does not modify the state of any variable. The state of all variables remains the same, and a value equal to the length of `ops` is printed and returned at the output state. Since `ops` has a length less than or equal to 2500, the length of `ops` is also less than or equal to 2500.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every position `(i, j)` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500, and the length of `ops` is returned**
