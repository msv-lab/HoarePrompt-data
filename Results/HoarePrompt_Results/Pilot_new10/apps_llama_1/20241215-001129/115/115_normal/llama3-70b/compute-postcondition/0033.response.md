The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are 1. 

Therefore, the tuple `(1 + 1, 1 + 1)` which equals `(2, 2)` is appended to `ops`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` is still an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, and if at least one of the following is 1: `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, then `ops` also contains `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`**
