The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `ops` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, so the tuple `(1 + 1, 2 + 1)` which is `(2, 3)` is appended to `ops`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, and `j` do not change. The state of `ops` changes by appending a new tuple `(2, 3)` to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ops` contains its original tuples plus a new tuple `(2, 3)`**
