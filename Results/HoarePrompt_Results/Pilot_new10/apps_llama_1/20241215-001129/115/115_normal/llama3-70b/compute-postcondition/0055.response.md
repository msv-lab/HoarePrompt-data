The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of the variables directly. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), 
- `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 2, 
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, 
- `i` is 2, 
- `j` is 2, 
- if at least one of `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, or `A[3][1]` is 1, then `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and also contains the tuples including `(3, 1)` and `(3, 2)`. 
- If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 
- Otherwise, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and no changes were made to `A`, `i`, `j`, except for `ops` now containing `(3, 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, we move to the next iteration of the loop, and the conditionals related to `ops` and the 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` remain as they were before the `continue` statement, considering the conditions that led to the `continue`.**
