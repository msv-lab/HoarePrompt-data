To calculate the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.


The initial state specifies:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers.
- `ops` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- At least one of the following conditions is true: the current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, or the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.
- If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.


The given Python code snippet is:
```python
ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
```


This code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `ops` list.


Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1 and `j + 1` equals 1.


So, the tuple `(1, 1)` is appended to the `ops` list.


The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.


Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers.
- `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- At least one of the following conditions is true: the current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, or the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.
- If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and at least one of the following conditions is true: the current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, or the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, if `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged**
