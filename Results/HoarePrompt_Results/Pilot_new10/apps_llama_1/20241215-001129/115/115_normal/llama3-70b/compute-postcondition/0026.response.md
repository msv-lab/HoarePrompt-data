Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s. If the 2x2 sub-matrix at position (i, j) in `A` has all 1s, the rest of the code for the current iteration is executed. Otherwise, the rest of the code for the current iteration is skipped.***
