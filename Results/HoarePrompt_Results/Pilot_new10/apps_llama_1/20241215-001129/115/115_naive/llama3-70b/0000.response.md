Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code checks each 2x2 submatrix in matrix A and if any of the elements are 1, it adds an operation to set all elements in the corresponding submatrix in B to 1. However, this approach does not consider the case when a single operation can set multiple elements in A to 1.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:
```
4 4
1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1
```
In this case, the program will output a sequence of operations that does not correctly transform matrix B into matrix A. This is because the program adds an operation for each 2x2 submatrix that contains at least one 1, without considering whether the operation would also set other elements in A to 1.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible operations and their effects on matrix B, and then find a sequence of operations that correctly transforms matrix B into matrix A. The provided code does not do this, and therefore it is incorrect.
