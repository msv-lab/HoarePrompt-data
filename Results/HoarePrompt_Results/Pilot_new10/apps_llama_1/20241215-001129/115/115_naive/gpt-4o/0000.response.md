Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue with the program lies in its approach to making matrix B equal to matrix A. It checks for 2x2 submatrices in A where all elements are 1, and then performs an operation on the corresponding submatrix in B. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases where a 2x2 operation in B can be used to match elements in A.

For example, if A contains a single 1 in a position where it cannot be part of a 2x2 submatrix filled with 1s, the program does not handle this case correctly. The program only checks for 2x2 submatrices completely filled with 1s in A and applies operations in B based on those. 

A simple counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Given A as:
```
1 0
0 0
```

In this case, no 2x2 operation can be applied to B to make it equal to A, but the program will not find a correct sequence of operations or identify that it's impossible to make B equal to A by the specified operations. 

However, upon reviewing the original code again, it seems there's an even simpler issue - the code does not handle cases where the best strategy involves turning on parts of the matrix in a different pattern than it checks for. The provided code only checks for specific conditions and applies operations based on those, without considering other possibilities for making B equal to A.

To correct the program, we would need to implement a different strategy, possibly involving checking each element of A and determining the best sequence of 2x2 operations in B to match it, or proving that no such sequence exists. This might involve backtracking or a more complex algorithm. Without such a correct approach, the program's current strategy is insufficient to handle all cases as specified in the problem description. 

In conclusion, due to the limitations in the program's logic and its inability to handle all potential cases as specified, the program is considered incorrect.
