To calculate the output state, we first analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 0
- `res` is an empty list
- `i` is 0

The code provided is `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)`. 

The impact of this code on the program is that it appends a calculated value to the `res` list. The calculated value is based on `i`, `k`, and the expression `(k * 2 + 1)`.

Since `i` is 0, the expression `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` simplifies to `0 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = 1`. 

Thus, the value `1` is appended to the `res` list.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation, given that `i` is used in the calculation but its value does not change as a result of the code execution.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 0
- `res` is a list containing the single element `1`
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 0, `res` is a list containing the single element `1`, `i` is 0**
