To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 1
- `res` is a list containing the single element `1`
- `i` is 1

The code snippet is:
```python
res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
```

This line of code appends a new element to the list `res`. The new element is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.

Given that `i` is 1, the new element can be simplified to `1 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = k * 2 + 2`.

The states of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not affected by this operation. The only change is in the list `res`, which now contains two elements: `1` and `k * 2 + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 1
- `res` is a list containing the elements `1` and `k * 2 + 2`
- `i` is 1

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 1, `res` is a list containing the elements `1` and `k * 2 + 2`, `i` is 1**
