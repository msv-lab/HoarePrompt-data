The code snippet provided prints the elements of the `positions` list, separated by spaces, to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `n`, `k`, `positions`, or `i`. The length of `positions` is returned as output.

Output State: **`n` is the original value, `k` is the original value, `positions` is a list containing a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1`, with the last number not exceeding `n`, `i` is the first number in the sequence that exceeds `n`, the sequence of numbers in `positions` is printed, and the length of `positions` is returned.**
