The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The parameter `n` is constrained between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and the parameter `k` is constrained between 0 and 1000 (inclusive). 

Since the specific return values of the function are not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, where n and k are integers and 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.**
