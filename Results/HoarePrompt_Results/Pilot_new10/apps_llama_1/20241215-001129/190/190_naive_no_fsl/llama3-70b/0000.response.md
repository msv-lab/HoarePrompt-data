Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires finding the minimum cost to change the lengths of sticks such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer `t`. The provided program attempts to solve this by starting with the middle stick length as the initial `t` and then exploring other possible values of `t` by iterating over the range of possible stick lengths.

However, the issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for each possible value of `t`. The line `cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))` calculates the minimum cost for a given `t` as the sum of the minimum distances between each stick length and either `t` or `t + 1`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the minimum cost is always achieved by changing the stick length to either `t` or `t + 1`, which is not necessarily true.

A counterexample to the program is when the input is `5` and the stick lengths are `1 1 100`. In this case, the program will incorrectly calculate the minimum cost as `sum((min(abs(1 - 50), abs(1 - 51))) + (min(abs(1 - 50), abs(1 - 51))) + (min(abs(100 - 50), abs(100 - 51)))) = 2 + 2 + 50 = 54`, whereas the correct minimum cost is `0` when `t` is `1` or `100`.

To correctly solve this problem, a more exhaustive approach is needed, such as iterating over all possible values of `t` and calculating the minimum cost for each one. The minimum cost for a given `t` can be calculated as the sum of the minimum distances between each stick length and either `t - 1`, `t`, or `t + 1`. 

Here is an example of how the correct program could look like:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_t = None
    for t in range(1, 101):
        cost = 0
        for x in sticks:
            cost += min(abs(x - (t - 1)), abs(x - t), abs(x - (t + 1)))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = t
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```
