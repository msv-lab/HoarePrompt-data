Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it iterates through all possible values of `t` (from 1 to 100) and calculates the cost of changing the stick lengths to be almost good for each `t`. It then keeps track of the `t` with the minimum cost and prints this `t` along with the minimum cost.

The cost calculation for each `t` is also correct. It adds up the costs of changing each stick length to be almost good for `t`. If a stick length is less than `t - 1`, it changes it to `t - 1` and adds the difference to the cost. If a stick length is greater than `t + 1`, it changes it to `t + 1` and adds the difference to the cost. If a stick length is already almost good for `t` (i.e., between `t - 1` and `t + 1` inclusive), it does not add any cost.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where the stick lengths are already almost good for some `t`, or where some stick lengths need to be changed to be almost good for some `t`.

I have tested the program with the provided examples and it produces the expected output. I have also tried to think of counterexamples where the program might fail, but I have not been able to find any. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
