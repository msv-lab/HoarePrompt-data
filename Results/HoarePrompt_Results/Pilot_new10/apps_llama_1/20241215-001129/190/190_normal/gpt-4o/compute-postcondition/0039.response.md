To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element.
- `t` is 2.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- The conditions regarding `length` (the first element in the list `a`), `current_cost`, and the list `a` itself need to be considered for state adjustments.

The loop statement is `for length in a:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the first element of `a` has been processed (since we're considering the state after the previous iteration). For the loop to execute again, the list `a` must have at least one more element besides the one that was just processed.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `a` must have at least 2 elements, because one element has already been processed.
- The new `length` will be the second element in the list `a`, since the loop iterates over each element in `a` in sequence.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` do not change based on the loop itself but might change based on the operations within the loop body, which are not specified here.
- The condition regarding `length` and `current_cost` would apply to the new `length` (the second element in `a`) in the next iteration. However, since we do not know the exact value of the new `length`, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_cost` without the loop body details.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`**
