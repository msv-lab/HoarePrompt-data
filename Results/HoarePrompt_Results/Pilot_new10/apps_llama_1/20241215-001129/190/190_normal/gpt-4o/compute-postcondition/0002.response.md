The code `min_cost = float('inf')` assigns the variable `min_cost` a value of positive infinity. The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged as the code does not affect these variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity**
