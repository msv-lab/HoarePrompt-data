Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 2, initially `min_cost` was positive infinity, initially `best_t` was -1, `length` is the last element in `a`, and initially `current_cost` was the sum of all `max(1 - length, 0, length - 3)` for each `length` in `a`. The current value of `current_cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.**
