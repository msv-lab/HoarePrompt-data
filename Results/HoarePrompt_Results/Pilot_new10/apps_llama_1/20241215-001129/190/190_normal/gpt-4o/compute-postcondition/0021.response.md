To solve this problem, we need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.


The initial state is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements
- `min_cost` is positive infinity
- `best_t` is -1
- `t` is 2
- `current_cost` is not defined in the initial state but it is used in the code


However, `length` and `current_cost` are not defined in the initial state, so let's assume that they are already defined and initialized with some values before executing the given code. This means that:
- `length` is a predefined variable with some value
- `current_cost` is a predefined variable with some value


The given Python code snippet is:
```python
current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

Given `t` is 2, we can substitute `t` in the code:
```python
current_cost += length - (2 + 1)
```
Which simplifies to:
```python
current_cost += length - 3
```


Now, let's analyze the impact of this code on the variables:


- `n` is not affected by the code.
- `a` is not affected by the code.
- `min_cost` is not affected by the code.
- `best_t` is not affected by the code.
- `t` is not affected by the code, it remains 2.
- `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 3` to its previous value.


Therefore, the output state is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements
- `min_cost` is positive infinity
- `best_t` is -1
- `t` is 2
- `current_cost` is its previous value plus `length - 3`
- `length` is a predefined variable with some value

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is its previous value plus `length - 3`, `length` is a predefined variable with some value**
