The code sets the value of `current_cost` to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` was the sum of all `max(1 - length, 0, length - 3)` for each `length` in `a`. After executing the code, `current_cost` becomes 0, but the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is 0**
