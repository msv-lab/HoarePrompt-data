According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `t` is 1, and we don't have any information that any element has been removed from `a`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and since one iteration has passed, the next element in `a` should be considered.

Since we don't know the exact elements of `a` and their current state other than it having at least 2 elements and `t` is 1, and we are only considering the condition for the loop to execute again, `t` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2**
