The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a list of integers to the variable `a`. The integers in this list are obtained by splitting the input string into substrings separated by whitespace and then converting each substring to an integer. 

Given the initial state, we know that `n` is an input integer, but the code provided does not directly affect `n`. Instead, it creates a new list `a` containing integers. These integers are input values, so their specific values depend on the input provided. 

The initial condition mentions a list of positive integers representing stick lengths, with each stick length being between 1 and 100 (inclusive), but it does not directly relate to the code snippet given. However, if we assume that the input for the list `a` is this list of stick lengths, then `a` would contain a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), representing the stick lengths.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of input integers representing stick lengths, each being between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
