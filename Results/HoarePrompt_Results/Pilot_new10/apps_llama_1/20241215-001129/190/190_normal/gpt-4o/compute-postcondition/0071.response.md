To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, 
- `t` is 3, 
- `length` is the next element in the list, 
- `current_cost` is the updated value after the previous iteration.

The code to execute is: 
```python
current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

Since `t` is 3, `t + 1` equals 4. Therefore, the code can be simplified to:
```python
current_cost += length - 4
```

The impact of this code on the program is that it updates the `current_cost` variable by adding the difference between the `length` (which is the next element in the list `a`) and 4.

The output state after executing this code will be:
- `n` remains an input integer, 
- `a` remains a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 3 elements, 
- `t` remains 3, 
- `length` remains the next element in the list `a`, 
- `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 4`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the next element in the list `a`, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`.**
