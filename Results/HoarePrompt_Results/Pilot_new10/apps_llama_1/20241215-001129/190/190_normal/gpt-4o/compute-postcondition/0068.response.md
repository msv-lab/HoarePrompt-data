Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 3. If `length` is less than 2, then `current_cost` is `current_cost + 2 - length`. If `length` is between 2 and 4 (inclusive), there are no changes to `current_cost` or other variables. If `length` is greater than 4, then `current_cost` is increased by `length - 4`.**
