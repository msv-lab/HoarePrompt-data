Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is `current_cost` + `1 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and less than or equal to `t + 1`, then `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `current_cost` retain their previous values. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is its previous value plus `length - 3`. Regardless of the `length` value, `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` retain their initial values, except for the `current_cost` updates based on the `length` conditions.**
