To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider what the loop code does and how it updates the variables `min_cost` and `best_t`.

The loop iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100. For each `t`, it calculates a `current_cost` based on the list `a`. The `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments needed for each length in `a` to be within the range `[t-1, t+1]`. If the `current_cost` is less than the current `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost` and `best_t` is set to the current `t`.

After all iterations, `min_cost` will hold the minimum cost found among all possible values of `t`, and `best_t` will hold the value of `t` that corresponds to this minimum cost.

If the list `a` is empty, the loop will still execute 100 times, but `current_cost` will always be 0, so `min_cost` will be updated to 0 and `best_t` will be set to 1 (or any other value of `t` if there are multiple minima).

If the list `a` is not empty, the final value of `min_cost` will be the minimum cost found, and `best_t` will be the value of `t` that achieves this minimum cost.

The original value of `n` is not changed by the loop, and the original list `a` is also not changed.

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `a` is the original list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is the minimum cost to adjust all lengths in `a` to be within a range of the form `[t-1, t+1]` for some `t` between 1 and 100, and `best_t` is the value of `t` that achieves this minimum cost.**
