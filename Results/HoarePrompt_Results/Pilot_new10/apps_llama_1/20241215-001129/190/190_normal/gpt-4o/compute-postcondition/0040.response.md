The code updates the value of `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. The value of `t` is 2 and the value of `length` is the second element in the list `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`, `current_cost` is `current_cost` + 2 - 1 - `length` = `current_cost` + 1 - `length` = `current_cost` + 1 - `a[1]`.**
