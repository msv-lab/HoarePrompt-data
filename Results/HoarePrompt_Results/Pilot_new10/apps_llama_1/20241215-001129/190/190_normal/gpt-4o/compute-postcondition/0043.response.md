Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`. If `length` is less than 1, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost` + 1 - `length` = `current_cost` + 1 - `a[1]`. If `length` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, no update is done to `current_cost`. If `length` is greater than 3, `current_cost` is updated to its previous value plus `length - 3`.***
