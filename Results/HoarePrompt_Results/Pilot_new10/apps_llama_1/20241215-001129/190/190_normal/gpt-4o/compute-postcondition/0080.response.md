The code simply prints the values of `best_t` and `min_cost`. It does not modify any variables. 

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `a` is the original list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is the minimum cost to adjust all lengths in `a` to be within a range of the form `[t-1, t+1]` for some `t` between 1 and 100, `best_t` is the value of `t` that achieves this minimum cost, and the values of `best_t` and `min_cost` have been printed**
