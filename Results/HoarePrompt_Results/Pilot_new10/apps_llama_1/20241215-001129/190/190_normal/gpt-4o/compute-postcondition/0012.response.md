Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, if the length (which is the first element in the list `a` and is greater than or equal to `t - 1`) is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is `a[0] - 2`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `current_cost` being 0.***
