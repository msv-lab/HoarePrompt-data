To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity.

The given code is:
```python
best_t = -1
```
This code introduces a new variable `best_t` and assigns it the value `-1`. 

The impact of the code on the program is the introduction of `best_t` with a value of `-1`, while the values of `n`, `a`, and `min_cost` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1**
