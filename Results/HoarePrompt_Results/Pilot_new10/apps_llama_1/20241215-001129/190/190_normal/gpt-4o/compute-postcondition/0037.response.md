Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 1 element, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1. If `length` (the first element in the list `a`) is more than 3, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`. Regardless of the condition, `length` is more than or equal to 1 and `t` remains 2.***
