To calculate the result, we need to know the value of `current_cost` and `length`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `current_cost` and `length`. 

Assuming `current_cost` and `length` have some initial values, the value of `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`, which is `2 - 1 - length`, so `1 - length`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is `current_cost` + `1 - length`**
