According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is less than 101, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be increased by 1, so `t` is 2. The other variables `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `current_cost` do not affect the loop condition.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1**
