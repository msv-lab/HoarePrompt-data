The code introduces a new variable `current_cost` and assigns it the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is 0**
