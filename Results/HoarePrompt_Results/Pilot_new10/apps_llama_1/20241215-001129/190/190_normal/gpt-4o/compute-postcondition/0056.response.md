According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is 0. For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least 1 element and `length` will be the first element in `a` at the start of the loop. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `length` is the first element in `a`, `current_cost` is 0**
