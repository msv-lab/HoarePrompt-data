Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 3. If `length` is greater than 4, then `current_cost` is increased by `length - 4`, otherwise, there are no changes to `current_cost` or other variables.***
