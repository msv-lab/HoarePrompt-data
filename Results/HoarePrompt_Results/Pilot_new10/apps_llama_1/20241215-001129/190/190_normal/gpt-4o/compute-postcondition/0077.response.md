The code assigns the value of `t` to `best_t`. The value of `t` is 3. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments based on elements in `a` that are outside the range [2, 4], `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is 3.
