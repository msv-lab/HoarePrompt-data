The function func accepts a list of stick lengths as input from the user. The list is expected to contain positive integers in the range of 1 to 100, with the count of stick lengths also in the range of 1 to 1000. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:
1. It first reads the number of stick lengths, denoted by `n`, from the user.
2. Then, it reads the actual stick lengths, which are stored in the `sticks` list.
3. The stick lengths are sorted in ascending order.
4. The function calculates the median of the stick lengths, denoted by `mid`.
5. It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each stick length and the median, denoted by `cost`.
6. The function initializes two variables, `min_cost` and `min_t`, to store the minimum cost and the corresponding stick length, respectively.
7. It then iterates over the range of possible stick lengths, from `mid - 1` down to 1, and calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and either the current length or the next length.
8. If the calculated cost is less than the current minimum cost, the function updates `min_cost` and `min_t`.
9. The function then iterates over the range of possible stick lengths, from `mid + 1` up to 100, and performs the same calculation as in step 7.
10. Finally, the function prints the stick length that achieves the minimum cost, denoted by `min_t`, and the minimum cost itself, denoted by `min_cost`.

The functionality of the function is to find the stick length that minimizes the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and either the current length or the adjacent length, and then print this stick length and the corresponding minimum cost.
