Correctness: **False**

The provided code attempts to find the optimal value of `t` by checking all possible values around the median of the stick lengths. However, it only considers values of `t` that are either one more or one less than the current `t` being considered. This approach is incorrect because the optimal `t` could be any integer value, not just the ones adjacent to the current values being checked.

For example, if the stick lengths are [1, 2, 3, 100], the median is 2.5, which is rounded down to 2. The code then checks values of `t` around 2, but it does not consider the possibility that `t` could be a larger value, such as 101, which would result in a lower total cost because all sticks could be changed to be almost good for `t=101` at a lower cost than being almost good for `t=2` or `t=3`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check all possible values of `t`, not just the ones around the median. We can do this by iterating over all possible values of `t` from 1 to some maximum value (e.g., the maximum stick length plus one), and for each `t`, calculate the total cost of changing all sticks to be almost good for `t`. The value of `t` with the minimum total cost is the optimal solution. 

The correct code would involve a more exhaustive search of possible values of `t`, rather than just checking values around the median. 

Here is an example of how the correct code might look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_t = None
    for t in range(1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - t), abs(x - (t-1)), abs(x - (t+1))) for x in sticks)
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = t
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```
This code checks all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 and keeps track of the value of `t` with the minimum total cost. This approach ensures that we find the optimal solution, regardless of the specific values of the stick lengths.
