The code `min_t = i` assigns the value of `i` to `min_t`. 
Given that `i` is `mid - 3`, the value of `min_t` becomes `mid - 3`.
The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `i` is `mid - 3`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, which is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 3` or `mid - 2`; `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 3` or `mid - 2`; `min_t` is `mid - 3`**
