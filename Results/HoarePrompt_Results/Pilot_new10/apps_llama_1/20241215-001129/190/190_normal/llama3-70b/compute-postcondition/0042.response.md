The provided code snippet is a print statement that outputs the values of `min_t` and `min_cost`. This operation does not modify any variables but rather displays their current values.

Output State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, `n` is an integer, `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`, `t` equals `mid`, `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i - 1` for any `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum, and `min_t` and `min_cost` have been printed.**
