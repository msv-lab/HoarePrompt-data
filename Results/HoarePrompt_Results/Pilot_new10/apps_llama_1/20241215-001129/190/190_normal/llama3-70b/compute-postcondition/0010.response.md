Postcondition: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; initially, `min_cost` was equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)` and `min_t` was equal to `mid`; `i` is `mid - 1`; initially, `cost` was equal to `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, and the current value of `cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.**
