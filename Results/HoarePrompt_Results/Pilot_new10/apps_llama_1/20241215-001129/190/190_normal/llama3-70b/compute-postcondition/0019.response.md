To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's break down the given loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):`, which means `i` will decrement by 1 at the end of each iteration until it reaches 1 (since the range is exclusive of 0).

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000.
- `n` is an input integer that is at least 2.
- `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2.
- `t` is equal to `mid`.
- `i` is `mid - 2`.
- If the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 2` or `mid - 1` is less than the current minimum cost, then `min_cost` is equal to this sum and `min_t` is equal to `mid - 2`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `sticks`, `n`, `mid`, and `t` remain unchanged because the loop does not modify these variables directly; the modifications depend on the operations within the loop body, which are not provided.
- `i` needs to decrement by 1 from its current value to continue the loop. Since `i` is currently `mid - 2`, at the next iteration, `i` will be `mid - 3`.
- The conditions and relations involving `min_cost` and `min_t` are dependent on the operations within the loop body and cannot be directly updated without that context. However, as per the problem statement, we are focusing on the state that allows the loop to execute again, which primarily concerns the loop variable `i` and its relation to the defined range.

State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `i` is `mid - 3`; if the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 2` or `mid - 1` is less than the current minimum cost, then `min_cost` is equal to this sum and `min_t` is equal to `mid - 2`.**
