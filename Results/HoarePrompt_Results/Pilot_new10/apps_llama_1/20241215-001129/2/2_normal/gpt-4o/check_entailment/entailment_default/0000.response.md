Correctness: **False**

The code attempts to find the integer that doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. However, it has a flaw in its logic. When the first digit of x is '1', it generates a candidate string consisting of '9' repeated n-1 times. This candidate string is then compared to x, and if it has a larger sum of digits, it is printed; otherwise, x is printed.

However, this approach fails to consider the case where x itself has the maximum sum of digits among all integers that don't exceed it. In such cases, the code should print x, but it may not do so if the generated candidate has a smaller sum of digits.

For example, consider the input x = 199. The code generates a candidate string '99', which has a smaller sum of digits than x (1+9+9 = 19, while 9+9 = 18). In this case, the code should print x (199), but it will print the candidate (99) instead.

To fix this issue, the code should generate all possible integers that don't exceed x, calculate their sum of digits, and keep track of the integer with the maximum sum of digits. However, the current implementation does not do this, and therefore, it is incorrect. 

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all integers less than or equal to x, calculating their sum of digits, and keeping track of the integer with the maximum sum of digits. This would ensure that the code correctly finds the integer that doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. 

The provided output hints agree with the code, but they don't help prove that the code is correct. The output hints only describe the functionality of the helper function `func_1`, which calculates the sum of digits of a given integer. They don't provide any information about the correctness of the main logic of the code. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect, and its correctness is **False**.
