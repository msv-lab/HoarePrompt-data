The code updates the value of `max_num` to be equal to `i`. The previous value of `i` is 3. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 3**
