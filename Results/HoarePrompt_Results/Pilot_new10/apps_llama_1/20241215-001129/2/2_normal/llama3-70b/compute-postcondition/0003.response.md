According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is introduced in the loop and will take values from 1 to `x` (inclusive). 

So, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to include `i` and the condition that `x` must be at least 1 is already satisfied by the given state. 

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1**
