The code calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and assigns it to `digit_sum`. Since `i` is 2, the sum of its digits is 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 1**
