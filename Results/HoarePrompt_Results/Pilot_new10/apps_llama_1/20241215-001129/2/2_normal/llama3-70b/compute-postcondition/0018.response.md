Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 3, and nothing changes whether `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum` or not, since there is no else part to handle the alternative condition and no changes are specified in the if part***
