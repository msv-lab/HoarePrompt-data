Correctness: **False**.

The given program is not efficient for large inputs because it iterates over all numbers from 1 to x, which can be up to 10^18. This will cause a timeout for large inputs.

A more efficient approach would be to start from x and decrease the number while calculating the sum of its digits. This way, we can stop as soon as we find the first number with the maximum sum of digits, which will be the largest such number.

For example, if x = 10000000000000000, the program will take a very long time to run because it will iterate over all numbers from 1 to x. However, we can start from x and decrease the number, and as soon as we find a number with a sum of digits greater than the current maximum sum, we can update the maximum sum and the corresponding number.

Here is an example of a more efficient solution:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for num in range(x, 0, -1):
        digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(num)))
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = num
        elif digit_sum == max_sum:
            max_num = max(max_num, num)
    print(max_num)
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(x), but it is still more efficient than the original solution because it starts from x and decreases the number. 

But there is still a more efficient way to solve this problem, by constructing the number from left to right, starting with the maximum possible digit (9) and then filling in the rest of the digits to make the largest possible number with the maximum sum of digits. 

This can be done in O(log x) time, where log x is the number of digits in x. 

Here is an example of a more efficient solution:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for num in range(x, x // 10 - 1, -1):
        digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(num)))
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = num
        elif digit_sum == max_sum:
            max_num = max(max_num, num)
    print(max_num)
```
This solution is more efficient, but still it is not the best one. 

We can solve this problem in O(log x) time, by starting with the maximum possible number with the same number of digits as x, and then decreasing the number while calculating the sum of its digits. 

Here is an example of the most efficient solution:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x_str = str(x)
    n = len(x_str)
    max_num = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            max_num += str(min(int(x_str[0]), 9))
        else:
            max_num += '9'
    if int(max_num) > x:
        max_num = '9' * (n - 1) + str(min(int(x_str[-1]), 9))
    print(max_num)
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(log x), which is the most efficient one. 

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it has a high time complexity and does not work efficiently for large inputs.
