Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description and achieves the desired outcome. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two inputs: an integer `n` representing the length of the genome and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

2. **Initial Counting**: It creates a dictionary `count` to store the counts of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the string `s`. This is done by iterating through `s` and incrementing the count for each nucleotide encountered.

3. **Calculating Target Counts**: The program calculates the average count `avg` that each nucleotide should have in the decoded genome by performing integer division of `n` by 4 (`n // 4`). It then updates the `count` dictionary to represent how many more of each nucleotide are needed to reach this average count.

4. **Replacing Unknown Nucleotides**: The program iterates through `s` again. When it encounters an unknown nucleotide ('?'), it replaces it with the first nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count greater than 0 in the `count` dictionary and then decrements that count. If it encounters a known nucleotide, it simply appends it to the result string.

5. **Output Handling**: After processing the entire string, if any values in the `count` dictionary are greater than 0, it means there were not enough '?' to fill all the required counts for the nucleotides, so the program prints '===' to indicate that it's impossible to decode the genome. Otherwise, it prints the decoded genome string.

The program always does what the problem description says because:

- It correctly handles the input and calculates the required counts for each nucleotide.
- It replaces the unknown nucleotides in a way that maximizes the chance of achieving equal counts for all nucleotides.
- It checks for the feasibility of decoding the genome based on the counts of nucleotides needed and the availability of unknown nucleotides to replace.

This approach ensures that the program either decodes the genome correctly by balancing the counts of all nucleotides or determines that it's impossible to do so, exactly as specified in the problem description.
