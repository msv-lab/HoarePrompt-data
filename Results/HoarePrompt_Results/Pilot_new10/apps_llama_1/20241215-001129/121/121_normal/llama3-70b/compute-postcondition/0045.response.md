According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` must have at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters and `c` is the second character in the string `s`. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `res` depends on the value of `c`**
