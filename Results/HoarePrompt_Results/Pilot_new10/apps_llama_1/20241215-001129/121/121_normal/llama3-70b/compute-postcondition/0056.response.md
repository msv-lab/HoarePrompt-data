Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'C'. If `count['C']` is greater than 0, then `res` is the old state of `res` plus 'C', `count['C']` is the old state of `count['C']` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count['C']` is 0 or less, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
