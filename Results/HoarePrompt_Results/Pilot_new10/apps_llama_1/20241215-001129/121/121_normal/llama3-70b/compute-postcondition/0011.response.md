The value of `count[c]` is incremented by 1. The variable `c` is still the third character in string `s`, and `n` remains an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive). The string `s` is still a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character in `s`, `count[c]` is incremented by 1**
