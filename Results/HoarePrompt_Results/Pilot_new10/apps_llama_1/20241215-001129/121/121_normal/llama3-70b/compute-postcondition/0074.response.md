To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive),
- `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters,
- `avg` is `n // 4`,
- `c` is the third character in the string `s`,
- `nc` is 'C',
- `res` is not defined in the initial state but it's being used in the code, so we assume its initial state is not specified but for the purpose of the calculation, we'll consider it as if it existed before this line and we are just adding `nc` to it.

Given Code: 
```python
res += nc
```

Since `nc` is 'C', the code is essentially appending 'C' to `res`. 

However, the initial state of `res` is not provided, so we can only express the result in terms of its previous state. If `res` was not initialized before this line, it would result in an error because you cannot add to a non-existent variable. Assuming it was initialized with some value (let's denote this initial value as `initial_res`), then after executing the given line, `res` would be `initial_res + 'C'`.

The values of `n`, `s`, `avg`, `c`, and `nc` do not change because of this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'C', `res` is `initial_res + 'C'`**
