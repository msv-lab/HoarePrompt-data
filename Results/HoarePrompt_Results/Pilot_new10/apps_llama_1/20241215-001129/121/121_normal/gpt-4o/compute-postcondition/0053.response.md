Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`. If `counts['G']` is less than `target_count`, then `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value for 'G' is incremented by 1, and `result[i]` is 'G' for some index `i`. Otherwise, `counts` and `result` remain unchanged.***
