The function processes two lines of input, the first containing an integer `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255) and the second a string `s` of length `n` with characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 4, counts nucleotides in `s`, and checks if any count exceeds `n // 4`. If `n` is not a multiple of 4 or any count exceeds `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces '?' in `s` with nucleotides that have counts less than `n // 4` and prints the modified string. The function does not handle unexpected input formats and assumes replacement of '?' is always possible without exceeding target counts.
