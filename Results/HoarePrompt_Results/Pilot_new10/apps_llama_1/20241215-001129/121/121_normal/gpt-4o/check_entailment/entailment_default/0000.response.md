Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says for every potential case. It first checks if the length of the genome `n` is a multiple of 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns. Then it counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in the genome string `s`. If any count exceeds `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns. Otherwise, it replaces the unrecognized nucleotides '?' with the nucleotides that have counts less than `n // 4`. 

The code correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description. For instance, in the example where the input is "8" and "AG?C??CT", the code correctly replaces the '?' with 'A', 'G', and 'T' to get the decoded genome "AGACGTCT". 

The code also correctly handles cases where the genome is already decoded, such as the example where the input is "4" and "AGCT". In this case, the code prints the original string "AGCT".

Furthermore, the code correctly handles cases where it is impossible to decode the genome, such as the examples where the input is "6" and "????G?" or "4" and "AA??". In these cases, the code prints '==='.

The output hints agree with the code and help confirm that the code is correct. The hints state that the function processes two lines of input, checks if `n` is a multiple of 4, counts nucleotides in `s`, and checks if any count exceeds `n // 4`. If `n` is not a multiple of 4 or any count exceeds `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces '?' in `s` with nucleotides that have counts less than `n // 4` and prints the modified string.

Overall, the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
