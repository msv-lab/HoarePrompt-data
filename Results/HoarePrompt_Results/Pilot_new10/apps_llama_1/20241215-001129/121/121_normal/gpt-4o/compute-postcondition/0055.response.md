Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, if `result[i]` is '?', then `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s` plus the number of times each character was used to update `result`, and `result` is a list of characters where '?' has been replaced with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' that have counts less than `target_count`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
