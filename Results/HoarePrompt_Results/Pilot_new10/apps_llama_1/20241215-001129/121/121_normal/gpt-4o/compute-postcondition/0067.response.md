Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result` is a list of characters where the value at index `i` is 'C' and '?' has been replaced with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' that have counts less than `target_count`, `i` is an integer such that `i + 1` is a valid index for `result`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the count of 'C' is incremented by 2 and the values of other keys are the total count of the respective character in `s` plus the number of times each character was used to update `result`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `char` is 'C'.***
