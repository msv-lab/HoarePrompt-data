To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255.
- `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
- `target_count` is `n // 4`.
- `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`.
- `char` is 'G'.
- `counts` and `result` remain unchanged unless `counts['G']` is less than `target_count`.

The given code is:
```python
result[i] = char
```
This line of code assigns the value of `char` to the `i`-th index of `result`. However, the code snippet does not specify the value of `i`, nor does it explicitly state how `result` is initialized or its previous state. 

Given the conditions, we know `char` is 'G', but without knowing the value of `i` or the previous state of `result`, we can only conclude that the `i`-th element of `result` is now 'G'. All other variables (`n`, `data`, `s`, `target_count`, `counts`) remain unchanged based on the provided code snippet unless `counts['G']` is less than `target_count`, which could imply a condition under which `result` might be modified. However, the modification of `result` depends on the condition and the specific implementation not provided.

Therefore, the Output State, considering the provided information and adhering strictly to the format, is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`, `char` is 'G', and `result[i]` is 'G' for some index `i`.**
