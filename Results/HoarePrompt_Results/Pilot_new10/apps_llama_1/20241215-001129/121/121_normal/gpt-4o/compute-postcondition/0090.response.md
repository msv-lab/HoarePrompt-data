The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is the current index plus 2, `result` is a list where the `i-th` index is `char`, `counts` is a dictionary where the count of `char` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
