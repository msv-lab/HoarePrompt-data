Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' and must have at least 2 characters, `target_count` is `n // 4`, if the second character of `s` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', then `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values where the count of the second character in `s` is incremented by 1; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged**
