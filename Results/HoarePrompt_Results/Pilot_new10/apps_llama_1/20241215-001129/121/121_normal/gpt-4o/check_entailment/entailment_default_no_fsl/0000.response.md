Correctness: **True**

The code provided meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly checks if the length of the string is a multiple of 4 and if any of the nucleotide counts exceed the target count. If either condition is not met, it prints '===' and returns.

It then iterates through the string, replacing each '?' with a nucleotide that has a count less than the target count. This approach ensures that the number of each nucleotide becomes equal.

The code handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For instance, in the first example, it replaces the '?' with 'A', 'G', and 'T' to achieve equal counts of each nucleotide. In the third and fourth examples, it correctly prints '===' because it is impossible to decode the genome.

The output hints also suggest that the code works as expected. The hints provide examples of cases where the code replaces '?' with nucleotides that have counts less than the target count, resulting in a valid decoded genome. In cases where the genome cannot be decoded, it correctly prints '==='.

Overall, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including edge cases where the length of the string is not a multiple of 4 or where the counts of nucleotides exceed the target count.
