You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It first checks if the length of the genome is divisible by 4, as it is a necessary condition for the number of nucleotides of each type to be equal. If the length is not divisible by 4, it immediately prints "===" and returns.

Next, it counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the given string `s`. It then checks if any nucleotide type has a count greater than the target count (`n // 4`). If so, it prints "===" and returns, as it is impossible to balance the counts.

Finally, it iterates over the string `s` and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide ('?') with the first nucleotide type that has a count less than the target count. This approach ensures that the counts of all nucleotide types are balanced.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Genomes with lengths that are not divisible by 4
* Genomes with more occurrences of a nucleotide type than the target count
* Genomes with unrecognized nucleotides that can be replaced to balance the counts
* Genomes that are already decoded correctly

The program's logic and implementation are sound, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is an available input where the first line contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer and 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `n` is a multiple of 4, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255.
    #   - `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
    #   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
    #   - `target_count` is `n // 4`.
    #   - `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for char in s:
    #       if char in counts:
    #           counts[char] += 1
    #   ```
    #   This loop iterates over each character in string `s`. If the character is one of the keys in the `counts` dictionary ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'), it increments the count for that character by 1.
    #
    #3. **Output State after Some Iterations**:
    #   - The output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations give us hints about how the variables change. 
    #   - `n`, `data`, and `target_count` do not change because the loop does not modify them.
    #   - `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations for the loop to execute that many times.
    #   - `counts` is updated based on the characters in `s` that match the keys in `counts`.
    #
    #4. **Final Output State**:
    #   - Since the loop iterates over all characters in `s` (which has a length of `n`), after all iterations, `counts` will contain the total count of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' characters in `s`.
    #   - The loop does not modify `n`, `data`, or `target_count`, so their values remain as in the initial state.
    #   - `s` is not modified by the loop, so its value remains the same.
    #
    #Given this analysis, if the loop executes (meaning `s` is not empty), the final state of `counts` will reflect the total counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in `s`. If the loop does not execute (because `s` is empty), then `counts` remains unchanged with all values being 0. However, since `s` is defined as a string of length `n` and `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` cannot be empty, ensuring the loop will always execute.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`.**
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255.
    #   - `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
    #   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
    #   - `target_count` is `n // 4`.
    #   - `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for char in counts:
    #       if counts[char] > target_count:
    #           print('===')
    #           return
    #   ```
    #   This loop iterates over each character in the `counts` dictionary ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'). If the count of any character exceeds `target_count` (`n // 4`), it prints '===' and returns from the function.
    #
    #3. **Output State after Some Iterations**:
    #   - The output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations give us hints about how the variables change. 
    #   - `n`, `data`, and `target_count` do not change because the loop does not modify them.
    #   - `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations for the loop to execute that many times, but since the loop iterates over `counts`, not `s`, this condition is always met since `s`'s length is used to populate `counts` before this loop.
    #   - `counts` is updated based on the characters in `s` that match the keys in `counts`, but this happens in the previous loop (not shown in this snippet).
    #
    #4. **Final Output State**:
    #   - Since the loop checks each character in `counts`, after all iterations, if none of the counts exceed `target_count`, the function will not return and will continue execution beyond this loop.
    #   - If any count exceeds `target_count`, the function will return after printing '===', indicating that at least one of the character counts in `s` exceeds the target count.
    #   - `n`, `data`, `s`, and `target_count` retain their initial values because they are not modified within this loop.
    #   - `counts` retains its value as calculated from `s` before this loop, showing the total count of each character in `s`.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop will depend on whether any character count exceeds `target_count`. However, since the loop's primary action is to check and potentially return, the variables' states are mostly determined by the previous loop that populated `counts`.
    #
    #- If the function does not return (meaning no count exceeds `target_count`), `n`, `data`, `s`, `target_count`, and `counts` will have the same values as after the previous loop that populated `counts`.
    #- If the function returns (meaning at least one count exceeds `target_count`), the state of the variables is frozen at the point of return, with `n`, `data`, `s`, and `target_count` unchanged, and `counts` reflecting the distribution of characters in `s`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations will reflect whether the function continued beyond this loop or returned due to exceeding `target_count`. Since `counts` is the critical variable here, and its calculation happens before this snippet, we consider its state as determined by the previous loop.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`. If any value in `counts` exceeds `target_count`, the function returns after printing '===', otherwise, it continues execution.**
