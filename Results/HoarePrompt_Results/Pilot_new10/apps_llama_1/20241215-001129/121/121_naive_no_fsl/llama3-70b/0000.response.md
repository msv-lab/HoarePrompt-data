Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`. It ignores the unrecognized nucleotides '?'.

2. Then, it calculates the average frequency of each nucleotide, which should be equal in the decoded genome. It does this by dividing the length of the genome `n` by 4.

3. The program then adjusts the count of each nucleotide to the desired frequency by subtracting the current count from the average frequency. This gives the number of unrecognized nucleotides that need to be replaced with each type of nucleotide.

4. It then iterates over the input string `s` and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide '?' with a nucleotide that still needs to be added to reach the desired frequency.

5. Finally, it checks if all counts of nucleotides to be added are zero. If any count is not zero, it means that it's impossible to decode the genome with equal frequencies of nucleotides, so it prints "==="; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:

* When the input string is already decoded and has equal frequencies of nucleotides.
* When it's impossible to decode the genome with equal frequencies of nucleotides.
* When there are multiple ways to decode the genome.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, so I conclude that the program is correct.
