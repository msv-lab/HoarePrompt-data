Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `v` is the third element in the list `a`, `nx` equals `px` and is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` equals `py` and is `(v - 1) % y`. If `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
