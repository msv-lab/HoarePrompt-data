Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `v` is the first element in the list `a`, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` equals 1**
