Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully implement the problem description for every potential case. 

One major issue is the undefined limit for the x and y ranges in the loops. The problem description states that the matrix size is x × y where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, but the code only checks up to x = 1000001 and y = 1000001. It should be checking all possible combinations within the given range.

Additionally, the code does not correctly implement the function to check if a move from one cell to another is valid based on the matrix dimensions and the cell values. It only checks if the absolute difference in the x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in the y-coordinates equals 1, but it does not consider the boundaries of the matrix.

Another issue is that the code does not consider all possible sequences of moves based on the given cell values. It only checks if the current sequence of moves is valid, but it does not try to find all possible sequences of moves that could lead to a valid solution.

The output hints indicate that the function `func_1(x, y)` throws a NameError because the variable 'a' is not defined. However, in the context of the given code, 'a' is indeed defined as the list of cell values. 

Lastly, the code does not handle the case when there are multiple possible solutions. It only prints the first solution it finds and exits, whereas it should print all possible solutions or at least one valid solution.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to check all possible combinations of x and y, correctly implement the move validation function, and consider all possible sequences of moves based on the given cell values. 

Here is an example of how the code could be corrected to handle these cases:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = ((a[0] - 1) // y, (a[0] - 1) % y)
    for v in a[1:]:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)!= 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True

for x in range(1, int(max(a)**0.5) + 1):
    if max(a) % x == 0:
        y = max(a) // x
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            break
    else:
        for y in range(x, int(max(a)**0.5) + 1):
            if x * y >= max(a) and all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
                print('YES')
                print(x, y)
                break
        else:
            continue
        break
else:
    print('NO')
```
This code still has room for improvement, especially regarding efficiency. For large inputs, it may take a long time to run due to its brute force approach. However, it should now correctly handle all cases and provide the expected output.
