The values of `px` and `py` are updated to be equal to `nx` and `ny` respectively. 
`nx` is `(v - 1) // y` and `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, where `v` is the first element in the list `a`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The absolute difference between `nx` and the new value of `px` is 0, and the absolute difference between `ny` and the new value of `py` is 0.
Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `v` is the first element in the list `a`, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `v` is the first element in the list `a`, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`.**
