Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is recalculated based on the new `v` and `y`, `py` is recalculated based on the new `v` and `y`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second element in the list `a`, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`. If `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, no explicit action is taken, implying that the program continues with the existing values of `x`, `y`, `px`, `py`, `a`, `v`, `nx`, and `ny`.***
