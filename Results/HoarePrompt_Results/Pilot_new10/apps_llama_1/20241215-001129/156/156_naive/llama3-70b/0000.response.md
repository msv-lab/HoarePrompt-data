Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program correctly handles the initial move from top to bottom by checking if `k < n - 1`. If true, it prints the current row number (`k + 1`) and column number (`1`).

2. After reaching the bottom, Lara moves in a snake-like fashion. The program correctly calculates the current row and column numbers using the formulas: 
   - `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` for the row number
   - `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1` for the column number

   These formulas take into account the snake-like movement pattern and the fact that Lara moves up and down by one row.

3. The program also correctly handles cases where `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2` by printing `(1, 2)`, which is the final destination according to the problem description.

4. The use of `k %= n * 2 - 2` ensures that `k` is within the range of valid moves, which helps to simplify the calculations.

Since the program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct. The program handles the problem's constraints, such as the range of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and does not contain any apparent logical errors or edge cases that are not handled.
