The function accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as input from the user, where `n` and `m` are positive integers and `k` is a non-negative integer, then prints specific values based on the reduced range of `k` modulo `n * 2 - 2`, without handling cases where `n` is odd or `k` is out of range, and without returning any messages.
