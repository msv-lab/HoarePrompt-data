Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m - 1`, because it reduces `k` modulo `n * 2 - 2` before calculating Lara's position. This reduction is incorrect, as it does not take into account the actual path that Lara takes, which is a snake-like pattern that repeats every `n - 1` rows.

For example, when `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 11`, the program correctly outputs `(1, 2)`. However, when `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m - 1`, the program will start to repeat the calculated positions incorrectly.

Additionally, the program does not check if `k` is within the valid range. The problem statement specifies that `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 ≤ k < n·m`, but the program does not enforce this constraint.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly calculate the row and column of Lara's position after `k` moves, taking into account the actual path that she takes. We should also add checks to ensure that `k` is within the valid range. 

Here's a basic idea of how it can be done (not necessarily the complete solution, but at least an idea of the necessary changes):
- Calculate how many complete rows Lara has traversed.
- Calculate the remaining moves after the complete rows.
- Based on the remaining moves, find Lara's position in the current row.

We also need to remember that Lara always ends up in cell `(1, 2)`, so if `k` is equal to `n * m - 1`, the output should be `(1, 2)`.
