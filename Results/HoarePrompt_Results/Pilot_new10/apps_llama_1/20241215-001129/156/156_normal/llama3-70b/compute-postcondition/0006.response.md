To solve this, we first analyze the given conditions and the code snippet.

Given:
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `k` is in the range 0 to 2n - 3.
- `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
- The current value of `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`.

The code snippet:
```python
print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
```

This code calculates and prints two values based on `n` and `k`. Let's break it down:

1. `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`:
   - `(k - n + 1)` calculates the difference between `k` and `n - 1`.
   - `% (n - 1)` calculates the remainder of this difference when divided by `n - 1`.
   - `n -... - 1` subtracts this remainder from `n` and then subtracts 1.

2. `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`:
   - This expression calculates the quotient of `(k - n + 1)` divided by `(n - 1)` and then adds 1.

Given the conditions:
- Since `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, the expression `(k - n + 1)` will range from 0 to `n - 2`.
- The `% (n - 1)` operation will thus give a value from 0 to `n - 2`.
- The first printed value, `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, will therefore range from `n - (n - 2) - 1 = 0` to `n - 0 - 1 = n - 1`.
- The second printed value, `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, since `(k - n + 1)` ranges from 0 to `n - 2`, the quotient will be 0 for all valid `k` because `(k - n + 1)` is always less than `n - 1`. Therefore, this expression will always evaluate to 1.

Thus, the first value printed depends on `k` and can range from 0 to `n - 1`, and the second value printed is always 1.

The output state remains that `n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is in the range 0 to 2n - 3, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. The specific values printed are based on the calculations above, but the state of `n`, `m`, and `k` themselves does not change; they simply influence the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is in the range `n - 1` to `2n - 3`, two values are printed: the first is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` which ranges from 0 to `n - 1`, and the second is always 1.**
