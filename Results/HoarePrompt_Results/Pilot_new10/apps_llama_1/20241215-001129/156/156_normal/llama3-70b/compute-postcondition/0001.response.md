The given code modifies the value of `k` by taking the modulus of `k` with the expression `n * 2 - 2`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` and `m`. 

Given that `k %= n * 2 - 2`, we can infer that the new value of `k` will be the remainder when the original value of `k` is divided by `n * 2 - 2`. This means `k` will be in the range `0` to `(n * 2 - 2) - 1`, or more simply, `0` to `2n - 3`.

The states of `n` and `m` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, `n` and `m` remain input integers.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is in the range 0 to 2n - 3**
