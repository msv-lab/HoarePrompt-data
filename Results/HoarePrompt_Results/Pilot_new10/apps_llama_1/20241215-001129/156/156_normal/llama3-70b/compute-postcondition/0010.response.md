Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is in the range 0 to 2n - 3. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the values of `k + 1` and 1 have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, the values of `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and 1 have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the values of 1 and 2 have been printed.**
