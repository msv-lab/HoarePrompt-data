Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is in the range 0 to 2n - 3, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, two values are printed: the first is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` which ranges from 0 to `n - 1`, and the second is always 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the program prints 1 and 2.**
