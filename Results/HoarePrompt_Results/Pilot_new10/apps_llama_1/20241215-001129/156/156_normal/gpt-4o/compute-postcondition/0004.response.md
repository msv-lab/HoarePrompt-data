The code `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` assigns the value of the integer division of `k` by `m - 1` to the variable `full_rows`. Given that `n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, and `k` is a non-negative integer that has been decreased by `n - 1` and is still less than `n * m`, we need to consider how these conditions affect the value of `full_rows`.

Since `k` has been decreased by `n - 1`, we can express `k` as `k = k' - (n - 1)`, where `k'` is the original value of `k`. However, the key information is that after this decrease, `k` is still less than `n * m`. The exact value of `k` isn't provided, but we know its relationship to `n` and `m`.

Given `k` and `m`, `full_rows` is calculated as `k // (m - 1)`. This means `full_rows` will be the largest whole number of times `m - 1` fits into `k`. Since `m` is at least 2, `m - 1` is at least 1, ensuring the division is valid.

The original conditions state that `n` is an even positive integer, `2 <= n <= 10^9`, and `m` is a positive integer, `2 <= m <= 10^9`. Additionally, after the decrease, `k` is less than `n * m`. These conditions remain unchanged as the code only introduces a new variable `full_rows` based on `k` and `m` without altering `n`, `m`, or the conditions they are subject to.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer that is less than `n * m` after being decreased by `n - 1`, and `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `m - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, and `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)`**
