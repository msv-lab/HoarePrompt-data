Postcondition: **`n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)`, and `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`. The current value of `full_rows` is an even number.**
