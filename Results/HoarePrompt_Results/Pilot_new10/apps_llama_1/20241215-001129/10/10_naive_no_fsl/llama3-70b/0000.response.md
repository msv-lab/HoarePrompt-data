Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not accurately implement the logic described in the problem. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which only checks the positions of the sofas based on their first coordinates. However, according to the problem description, a sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two cells `a` and `b` such that `x_{a} < x_{b}`, `a` is covered by A, and `b` is covered by B. The same conditions apply to the top, right, and bottom comparisons.

In the current implementation, the program only considers the first coordinate of each sofa, which is not sufficient. It should also consider the second coordinate of each sofa.

For example, consider the case where there are two sofas: one with coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2), and another with coordinates (2, 1) and (2, 2). The current implementation would not correctly determine the positions of these sofas relative to each other.

To fix this issue, the program should modify the `func_1` function to consider both coordinates of each sofa when determining their relative positions. 

Here's the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            for point in sofa:
                for point_s in s:
                    if point[0] < point_s[0]:
                        left += 1
                    if point[0] > point_s[0]:
                        right += 1
                    if point[1] < point_s[1]:
                        top += 1
                    if point[1] > point_s[1]:
                        bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```
However, even with this correction, there is still a problem. The current implementation increments the counters multiple times for each sofa, which is incorrect. The counters should only be incremented once for each sofa that meets the condition.

To fix this, the program should modify the `func_1` function to only increment the counters once for each sofa that meets the condition. 

Here's the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            left_sofa = any(point[0] < point_s[0] for point in sofa for point_s in s)
            right_sofa = any(point[0] > point_s[0] for point in sofa for point_s in s)
            top_sofa = any(point[1] < point_s[1] for point in sofa for point_s in s)
            bottom_sofa = any(point[1] > point_s[1] for point in sofa for point_s in s)
            if left_sofa:
                left += 1
            if right_sofa:
                right += 1
            if top_sofa:
                top += 1
            if bottom_sofa:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```
With these corrections, the program should accurately determine the positions of the sofas relative to each other and output the correct result.
