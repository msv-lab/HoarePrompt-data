You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. 

In the provided `func_1` function, the program only checks if the first point of the sofa is in the same column or row as the first point of another sofa, and if it is to the left, right, top, or bottom of that sofa. This is not sufficient to correctly determine the positions of the sofas relative to each other.

For example, consider the case where the storehouse has two sofas, one at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2), and another at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2). According to the problem description, the first sofa is to the left of the second sofa because point (1, 1) is to the left of point (2, 1). However, the provided `func_1` function would not correctly count the second sofa as being to the right of the first sofa because it only checks the first point of each sofa.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check all points of each sofa and compare them with all points of the other sofas. 

Here's a simple example to show how the provided code can be incorrect:

Input:
```
2
3 3
1 1 1 2
2 2 2 3
1 0 0 1
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

Actual output might not be the expected output because the provided code does not correctly calculate the positions of the sofas relative to each other.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the given problem for all possible inputs, and its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a list of four integers representing the coordinates of the sofa in the storehouse, and sofas is a list of lists where each sublist contains four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa in the storehouse.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four integers, `left` is the number of sofas to the right of `sofa` with the same y-coordinate, `right` is the number of sofas to the left of `sofa` with the same y-coordinate, `top` is the number of sofas below `sofa` with the same x-coordinate, `bottom` is the number of sofas above `sofa` with the same x-coordinate.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns left which is the number of sofas to the right of `sofa` with the same y-coordinate, right which is the number of sofas to the left of `sofa` with the same y-coordinate, top which is the number of sofas below `sofa` with the same x-coordinate, and bottom which is the number of sofas above `sofa` with the same x-coordinate.
