Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for several reasons:

1. In the function `func_1`, the conditions for checking if a sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the given sofa are incorrect. The current conditions only check if the sofas have the same y-coordinate or x-coordinate, but they do not consider the actual positions of the sofas.

2. The variables `left` and `right` are incremented when a sofa is found to the right and left of the given sofa, respectively, but with the same y-coordinate. However, the problem description states that a sofa A is to the left of sofa B if there exist two cells a and b such that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A, and b is covered by B. This means that the program should be checking the x-coordinates of the cells, not just the y-coordinates.

3. The function `func_1` only checks the first cell of each sofa, but it does not consider the second cell. This is incorrect because a sofa can be to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa based on either of its cells.

4. The problem description states that a sofa A can be both to the top and to the bottom of another sofa B, and similarly for left and right. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

5. The problem description also mentions that there can be empty cells in the storehouse, but the program does not take this into account.

Here is an example where the program does not follow the problem description:

Suppose we have two sofas: sofa A with cells (1, 1) and (1, 2), and sofa B with cells (2, 1) and (2, 2). According to the problem description, sofa A is to the left of sofa B. However, the program would not correctly identify this relationship because it only checks the first cell of each sofa and does not consider the actual positions of the cells.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly check the positions of the sofas based on both cells, and to handle the cases where a sofa can be both to the top and to the bottom of another sofa, or both to the left and to the right.
