The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only checks the first point of each sofa and does not correctly calculate the positions of the sofas relative to each other. However, the annotated version of the code suggests that the program is only checking the x and y coordinates of the first point of each sofa, but it does not take into account the second point of each sofa.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the positions of the sofas relative to each other. The function `func_1` only checks if the x-coordinates of the first points of two sofas are equal, or if the y-coordinates of the first points of two sofas are equal. This is not sufficient to determine if one sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa.

For example, consider the case where the storehouse has two sofas, one at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2), and another at positions (2, 1) and (3, 1). According to the problem description, the first sofa is to the left of the second sofa because point (1, 1) is to the left of point (2, 1). However, the provided `func_1` function would not correctly count the second sofa as being to the right of the first sofa because it only checks the first point of each sofa.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**
