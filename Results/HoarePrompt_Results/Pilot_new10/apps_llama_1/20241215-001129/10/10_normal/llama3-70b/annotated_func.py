#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a list of four integers representing the coordinates of the sofa in the storehouse, and sofas is a list of lists where each sublist contains four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa in the storehouse.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four integers, `left` is the number of sofas to the right of `sofa` with the same y-coordinate, `right` is the number of sofas to the left of `sofa` with the same y-coordinate, `top` is the number of sofas below `sofa` with the same x-coordinate, `bottom` is the number of sofas above `sofa` with the same x-coordinate.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns left which is the number of sofas to the right of `sofa` with the same y-coordinate, right which is the number of sofas to the left of `sofa` with the same y-coordinate, top which is the number of sofas below `sofa` with the same x-coordinate, and bottom which is the number of sofas above `sofa` with the same x-coordinate.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sofa and a list of sofas, and returns the number of sofas that are to the right, left, top, and bottom of the given sofa, with the same y-coordinate or x-coordinate, respectively, but with the correct interpretation of the counters being that `left` counts sofas to the right and `right` counts sofas to the left, due to the discrepancy between the annotations and the actual code.
