Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists with at least 3 sofas, `s` is the third sofa in `sofas`. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then the values of `right`, `left`, `top`, and `bottom` are updated based on the comparisons between the first and second elements of the first sub-lists in `sofa` and `s`: if the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second elements are equal, `right` is increased by 1; if the first element of `sofa` is less than the first element of `s` and the second elements are equal, `left` is increased by 1; if the second element of `sofa` is less than the second element of `s` and the first elements are equal, `top` is increased by 1; if the second element of `sofa` is greater than the second element of `s` and the first elements are equal, `bottom` is increased by 1; otherwise, `right`, `left`, and `top` remain unchanged, but the conditions are still evaluated.***
