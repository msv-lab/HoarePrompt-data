To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `sofa` is a list of four integers.
- `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least two sofas.
- `s` is the second sofa in `sofas`.
- The code is `left += 1`, which increments the value of `left` by 1.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about `left`. The code only affects `left`, and since `left`'s initial value or existence is not mentioned, we can only conclude that `left` is incremented by 1 from its previous state, whatever that might have been.

Given this, the output state, considering the information provided, is:
- `sofa` remains a list of four integers, as the code does not affect `sofa`.
- `sofas` remains a list of lists with at least two sofas, as the code does not modify `sofas`.
- `s` remains the second sofa in `sofas`, as the code does not alter the composition or indexing of `sofas`.
- `left` is increased by 1 from its previous, unspecified state.

Therefore, the Output State: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists with at least two sofas, `s` is the second sofa in `sofas`, and `left` is increased by 1**
