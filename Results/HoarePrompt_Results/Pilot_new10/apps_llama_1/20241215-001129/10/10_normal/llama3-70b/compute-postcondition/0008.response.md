Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least one sofa, `s` is the first sofa in `sofas`, `s` is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first pair in `s`, then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. If the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first pair in `s`, then `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `top` and `bottom` are integers where their current values depend on the conditions given in the precondition. In all cases, `top` and `bottom` remain 0 if the initial conditions for `left` and `right` are not met, `left` and `right` are updated according to the conditions, and `sofa`, `sofas`, and `s` maintain their initial properties.**
