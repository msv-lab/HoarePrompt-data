The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is 0, so the new value of `left` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The first element of the first pair in `sofa` is still less than the first element of the first pair in `s`, and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is still equal to the second element of the first pair in `s`. `s` is still the first sofa in `sofas` and `s` is not equal to `sofa`.
Output State: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least one sofa, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `s` is the first sofa in `sofas`, `s` is not equal to `sofa`, the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first pair in `s`, and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first pair in `s`.**
