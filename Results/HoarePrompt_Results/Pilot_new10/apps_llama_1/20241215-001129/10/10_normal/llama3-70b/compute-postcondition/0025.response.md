Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists with at least two sofas, `s` is the second sofa in `sofas`. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then the state of `left`, `right`, and `top` remains unchanged unless the following conditions are met: if the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is less than the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `top` is increased by 1; if the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then both `left` and `right` are increased by 1; if the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the second element of the first tuple in `s` and the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the first element of the first tuple in `s`, then `bottom` is increased by 1. If `s` equals `sofa`, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.**
