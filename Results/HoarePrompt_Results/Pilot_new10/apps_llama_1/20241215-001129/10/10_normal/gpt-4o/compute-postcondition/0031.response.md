Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `i` and `j` are integers, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the `j-th` sofa in `sofas`, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the current value of `right_count` is a list containing `d` values where the value at index `i` is 1 and the rest are zeros, otherwise the current value of `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `left_count` is a list containing `d` values where the value at index `i` is 1 and the rest are zeros if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, otherwise it is a list containing `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, and the current value of `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`.**
