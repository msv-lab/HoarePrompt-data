The given code snippet affects the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`. These variables are updated to the values of `sofas[j][0]`, `sofas[j][1]`, `sofas[j][2]`, `sofas[j][3]`, respectively.

Given that `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values of `sofas[2][0]`, `sofas[2][1]`, `sofas[2][2]`, `sofas[2][3]`, which are the same as their initial values. 

The other variables `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are not changed by the given code snippet. The condition "if `i` equals `j`, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise no action is taken" is not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is at least 3, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 2, `x1_j = sofas[2][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[2][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[2][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[2][3]`, and if `i` equals `j`, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise no action is taken.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 2, `x1_j = sofas[2][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[2][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[2][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[2][3]`, and if `i` equals `j`, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise no action is taken**
