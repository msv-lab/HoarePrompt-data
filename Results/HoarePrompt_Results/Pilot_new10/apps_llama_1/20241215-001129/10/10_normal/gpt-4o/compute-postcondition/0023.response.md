Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `i` and `j` are integers, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`. If `i` equals `j`, the loop iteration is skipped, otherwise the execution continues.***
