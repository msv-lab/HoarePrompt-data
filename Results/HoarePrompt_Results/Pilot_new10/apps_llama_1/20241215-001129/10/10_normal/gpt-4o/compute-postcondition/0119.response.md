Postcondition: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count` is a list where `left_count[i]` has been incremented by 1. Regardless of the condition, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa. The current value of `y1` is less than `y1_j` and the current value of `y2` is less than `y1_j`.**
