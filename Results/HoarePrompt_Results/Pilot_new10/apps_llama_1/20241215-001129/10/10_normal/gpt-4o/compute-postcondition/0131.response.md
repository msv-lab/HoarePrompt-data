To calculate the output state after the given Python code snippet is executed, we'll consider the impact of the code on the program and check the previous values of the affected variables.

Given the initial state:
- `d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1
- `j` is 1
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse
- `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers
- `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`
- `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`
- `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`
- `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`
- `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`
- `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`
- `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`
- `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`
- `top_count` is a list where the value at index `i` may be incremented by 1 if `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`
- `left_count` is a list where the value at index `i` may be incremented by 1 if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa where `right_count[i]` equals `right_count[i] + 1`, otherwise `right_count` remains unchanged
- `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa

The given code snippet:
```python
left_count[i] += 1
```
This code increments the value at index `i` of `left_count` by 1.

Output State: 
**`d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, 
`j` is 1, 
`n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, 
`m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, 
`sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, 
`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, 
`x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, 
`y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, 
`x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, 
`y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, 
`x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, 
`y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, 
`x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, 
`y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, 
`top_count` remains unchanged, 
`left_count` is a list where the value at index `i` is incremented by 1, 
`right_count` remains unchanged, 
`bottom_count` remains unchanged**
