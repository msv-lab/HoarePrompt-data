The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The input is expected to contain four integers separated by spaces. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each of these input values, converting them to integers. 

The initial state contains information about `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas`, but the code does not modify these variables. It introduces new variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` with values from the input.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples of sofa coordinates, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers**
