The code line `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]` updates the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` to the corresponding values in the `sofas` list at index `j`. 

Since `j` is 0, it assigns the first sofa's coordinates to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`.**
