The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are updated to input integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple of sofa coordinates `[(x1, y1, x2, y2)]`, where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the input integers.
