The code snippet assigns the coordinates of the second sofa in `sofas` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`. 

Given that `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the value of the second tuple in the `sofas` list (since list indices in Python start at 0).

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists containing at least `d+1` values, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the second sofa in `sofas`, i.e., `x1_j = sofas[1][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[1][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[1][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[1][3]**
