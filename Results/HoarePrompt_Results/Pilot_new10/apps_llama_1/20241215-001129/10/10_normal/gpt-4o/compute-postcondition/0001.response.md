The code `n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())` assigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input provided, where `n` and `m` represent the size of the storehouse. 

Given that `d` is the number of sofas, the input for the size of the storehouse, and the coordinates of each sofa, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa are pending, this code does not affect `d` or any Sofa positions. 

However, `n` and `m` are assigned the input values, which represent the number of rows and columns in the storehouse.

Output State: **`d` is the number of sofas, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, the coordinates of each sofa, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa are pending**
