The code initializes a list `left_count` with `d` zeros, where `d` is a non-negative integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros**
