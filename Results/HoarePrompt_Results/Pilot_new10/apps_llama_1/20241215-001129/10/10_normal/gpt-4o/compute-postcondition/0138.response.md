The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the impact of the `continue` statement cannot be directly determined. However, considering the initial state and the `continue` statement, we can infer that the values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the current loop iteration is skipped.


Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
