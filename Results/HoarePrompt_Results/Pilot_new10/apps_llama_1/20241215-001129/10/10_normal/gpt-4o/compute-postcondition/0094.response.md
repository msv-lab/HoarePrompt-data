To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.


The code snippet is `continue`. This statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the given initial state, there is no loop mentioned, but assuming it's part of a larger loop, the `continue` statement would move the execution to the next iteration of the loop.


Given the initial state:
- `d` is at least 3
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse
- `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers
- `j` is 2
- `x1_j = sofas[2][0]`
- `y1_j = sofas[2][1]`
- `x2_j = sofas[2][2]`
- `y2_j = sofas[2][3]`


The `continue` statement does not alter any variables' values directly; it only affects the flow of the program by moving to the next iteration of the loop (if it's within a loop). Since there are no assignments or modifications of variables in the given code snippet, all variable values remain the same.


Therefore, the output state, considering all information provided, is that all variables retain their initial values and the execution moves to the next iteration of the loop (if applicable), without changing any variable's value.


Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 2, `x1_j = sofas[2][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[2][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[2][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[2][3]`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
