The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we assume it is part of a loop. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `i` is equal to `j` which is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
