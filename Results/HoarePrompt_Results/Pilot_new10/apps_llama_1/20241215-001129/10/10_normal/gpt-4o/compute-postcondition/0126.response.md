The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there are no loops provided in the given code snippet, the effect of `continue` cannot be directly determined. However, based on the initial state and the given code, we can infer that the `continue` statement will not alter any variable values but will skip to the next iteration of the enclosing loop, if any.

Given the initial state and the fact that `continue` does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the understanding that the execution moves to the next iteration of the loop it is part of, if applicable.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `top_count` is a list where the value at index `i` may be incremented by 1 if `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `left_count` is a list where the value at index `i` may be incremented by 1 if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa, and we move to the next iteration of the enclosing loop, if any.**
