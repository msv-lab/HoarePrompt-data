Postcondition: **`d` is greater than 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index `i`, `right_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i`, `top_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas below the sofa at index `i`, `bottom_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas above the sofa at index `i`, `target_sofa` is -1, `i` is 0. The current value of `left_count` at index `i` equals `cnt_l`, the current value of `right_count` at index `i` equals `cnt_r`, the current value of `top_count` at index `i` equals `cnt_t`, and the current value of `bottom_count` at index `i` equals `cnt_b`.**
