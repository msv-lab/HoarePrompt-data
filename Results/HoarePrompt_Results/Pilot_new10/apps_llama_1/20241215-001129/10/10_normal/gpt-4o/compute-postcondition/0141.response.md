To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code snippet based on the initial state provided.

The code snippet is:
```python
right_count[i] += 1
```
Given the initial state:
- `d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1,
- `j` is 2,
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse,
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse,
- `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates,
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers,
- `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`,
- `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`,
- `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`,
- `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`,
- `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`,
- `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`,
- `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`,
- `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`.

The code increases the value of `right_count[i]` by 1. This means the variable `right_count[i]` is incremented, but its initial value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only conclude that `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 from its previous value.

All other variables (`d`, `j`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`) remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 from its previous value.**
