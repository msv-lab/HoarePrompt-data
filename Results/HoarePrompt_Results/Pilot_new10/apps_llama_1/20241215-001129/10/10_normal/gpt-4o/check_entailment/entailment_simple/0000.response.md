Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately implement the conditions for counting the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa as specified in the problem description. 

The problem description states that a sofa A is to the left of sofa B if there exist two cells a and b such that x_a < x_b, a is covered by A, and b is covered by B. However, the program checks if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j to determine if sofa i is to the right of sofa j. This condition is incorrect because it does not consider the actual cells covered by the sofas.

A correct implementation would compare the x-coordinates of the cells covered by the sofas. If the x-coordinate of any cell covered by sofa i is less than the x-coordinate of any cell covered by sofa j, then sofa i is to the left of sofa j.

Similarly, the conditions for checking if a sofa is to the right, top, or bottom of another sofa are also incorrect. 

To fix this, the program should be modified to correctly implement the conditions for counting the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
        
    cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]
            cells_i = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2)]
            cells_j = [(x1_j, y1_j), (x2_j, y2_j)]
            if any(x < min(x1_j, x2_j) for x, y in cells_i) and any(x < max(x1_j, x2_j) for x, y in cells_i):
                left_count[i] += 1
            if any(x > min(x1_j, x2_j) for x, y in cells_i) and any(x > max(x1_j, x2_j) for x, y in cells_i):
                right_count[i] += 1
            if any(y < min(y1_j, y2_j) for x, y in cells_i) and any(y < max(y1_j, y2_j) for x, y in cells_i):
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if any(y > min(y1_j, y2_j) for x, y in cells_i) and any(y > max(y1_j, y2_j) for x, y in cells_i):
                top_count[i] += 1
        
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and top_count[i] == cnt_t and bottom_count[i] == cnt_b:
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
        
    print(target_sofa)

func()
```

This corrected version of the program checks if any cell covered by sofa i is to the left, right, top, or bottom of any cell covered by sofa j, which accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description.
