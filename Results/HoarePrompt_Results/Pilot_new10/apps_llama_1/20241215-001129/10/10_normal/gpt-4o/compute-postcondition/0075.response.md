Postcondition: **`d` is at least 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, and `j` is 0. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then the current value of `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa where `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, and `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are less than `y1_j`.**
