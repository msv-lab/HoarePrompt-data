Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 3, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 2, `x1_j = sofas[2][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[2][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[2][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[2][3]`, and if `i` equals `j`, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise no action is taken***
