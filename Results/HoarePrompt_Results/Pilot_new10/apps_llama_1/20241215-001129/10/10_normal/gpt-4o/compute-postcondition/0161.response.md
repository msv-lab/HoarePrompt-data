According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d` and `i`. If `i` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 1, and now it must be greater than 2 for the next iteration to start.
State: **`d` is greater than 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index `i`, `right_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i`, `top_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas below the sofa at index `i`, `bottom_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas above the sofa at index `i`, `i` is 2**
