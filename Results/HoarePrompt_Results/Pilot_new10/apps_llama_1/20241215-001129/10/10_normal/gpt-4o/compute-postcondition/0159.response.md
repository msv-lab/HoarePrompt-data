The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index `i`, `right_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i`, `top_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas below the sofa at index `i`, `bottom_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas above the sofa at index `i`, `i` is 1, `target_sofa` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
