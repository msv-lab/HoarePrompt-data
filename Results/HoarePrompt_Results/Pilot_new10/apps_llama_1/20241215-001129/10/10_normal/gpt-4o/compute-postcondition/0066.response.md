The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not given any information about the loop, we will assume that we are inside a loop. 

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the `i-th` sofa, the current value of `j` is 0 and the current value of `i` is equal to `j`, which means `i` is also 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
