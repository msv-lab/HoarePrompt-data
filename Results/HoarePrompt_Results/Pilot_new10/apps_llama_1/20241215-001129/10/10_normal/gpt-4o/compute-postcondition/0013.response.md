The code `cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b = map(int, input().strip().split())` reads four integers from the input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into four parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`, respectively.

The initial state is: `d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates.

After the code is executed, the values of `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas` remain unchanged, but four new variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are introduced with values equal to the four input integers.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer**
