Correctness: **False**.

The given Python program is attempting to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number n. However, it doesn't actually implement the necessary logic to achieve this.

The program is currently calculating the number of divisors of the input number n, which is not the same as finding the different weights of its splits.

A correct implementation would involve generating all possible splits of the number n and then calculating the weight of each split. The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. The program should then return the number of distinct weights it finds.

For example, given the input 7, the program should find the following splits and their corresponding weights:
- [7] with weight 1
- [3, 3, 1] with weight 2
- [2, 2, 2, 1] with weight 3
- [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with weight 7

The program should then return 4, which is the number of distinct weights.

However, the given program does not implement this logic and instead calculates the number of divisors of the input number, which is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False. 

Here is a correct Python implementation for the problem:

```python
def func_1(num):
    weights = set()
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        split = []
        remaining = num
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            if remaining >= j:
                split.append(j)
                remaining -= j
        if remaining == 0:
            weight = split.count(split[0])
            weights.add(weight)
    return len(weights)

n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```
