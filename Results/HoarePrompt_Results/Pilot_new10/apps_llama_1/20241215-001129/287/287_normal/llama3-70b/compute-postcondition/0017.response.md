The value of `res` is decreased by 1. Initially, `res` is 4 if `n` is divisible by 3. After the decrease, `res` will be 3 if `n` is divisible by 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 10, `i` is 3, if `n` is divisible by 3, then `res` is 3**
