You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The key insight is that the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element, and this weight is always a divisor of `n`. 

The program iterates through all divisors `i` of `n`, and for each divisor, it increments the result `res` by 2 (except when `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it only increments `res` by 1). This is because each divisor `i` of `n` corresponds to two different weights of splits: one where the first element is `i` and one where the first element is `n/i`. 

However, when `i` is the square root of `n`, there is only one corresponding weight of split, so the program decrements `res` by 1 in this case to avoid double-counting. 

The program has been tested with several examples, and it produces the correct output in each case. Therefore, it appears to be correct. 

It's worth noting that this problem can be solved by observing that the number of different weights of splits of `n` is equal to the number of divisors of `n`. The given program takes advantage of this observation to calculate the result efficiently. 

In conclusion, the program seems to work correctly for all potential cases, and its logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is one input variable, n, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `i` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, `res` is the number of divisors of `n`, considering that if `n` is a perfect square, its square root is counted only once.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, counting the square root of `n` only once if `n` is a perfect square, and prints this count.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
