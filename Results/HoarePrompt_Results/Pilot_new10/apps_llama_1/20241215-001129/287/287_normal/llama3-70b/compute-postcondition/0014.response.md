According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the square root of `n` must be greater than 3, which means `n` must be greater than 9.

Since `n` is at least 4 and `i` is 2, we have the following conditions for `res`: if `n` is equal to `i` squared (i.e., `i * i == n`), then `res` is 1. If `n` is divisible by `i` but not equal to `i` squared, then `res` is 2. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then `res` is -1. For `i` = 3, these conditions still apply.

State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 10, `i` is 3, `res` depends on the value of `n` and can be 1 if `n` equals 9, 2 if `n` is divisible by 3 but not equal to 9, or -1 if `n` is not divisible by 3**
