Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The code actually calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, not the number of different weights of splits.

For example, for `n = 7`, the code outputs `4`, which is correct, but it does so because it happens to calculate the number of divisors of `7` as `4` (1, 7 are the divisors, and since `7` is not a perfect square, it counts each divisor twice, then subtracts one for the square root), not because it actually calculates the number of different weights of splits of `7`.

However, for other inputs, the code may not happen to give the correct answer. For instance, for `n = 12`, the code will calculate the number of divisors of `12` as `6` (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 are the divisors), but the actual number of different weights of splits of `12` is `13` (each number from 1 to 12 can be the first element of a split).

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**. 

The provided Python code does not produce the right results for all possible inputs. The given code actually counts the total number of divisors for the given number `n`. However, this is not what the problem is asking for. It is asking for the total number of different weights of splits of the given number `n`. These two problems are distinct and require different approaches. The code provided counts divisors, not weights of splits.
