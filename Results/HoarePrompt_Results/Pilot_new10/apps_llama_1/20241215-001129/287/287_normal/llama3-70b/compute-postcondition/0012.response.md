The code `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is either 0 or 2, depending on whether `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `res` is 2, so `res` becomes 1. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then `res` is 0, so `res` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 4, `i` is 2, if `n` is divisible by `i`, then `res` is 1, otherwise, `res` is -1**
