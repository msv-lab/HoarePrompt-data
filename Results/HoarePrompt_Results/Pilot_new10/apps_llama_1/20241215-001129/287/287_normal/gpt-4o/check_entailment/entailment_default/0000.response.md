Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not solve the problem as described. The problem asks to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. 

However, the provided code calculates the number of factors of `n` by iterating through integers up to its square root. This does not relate to the concept of splits and their weights.

For example, given the input `7`, the code will return `4` because `7` has `4` factors: `1`, `7`. However, this is a coincidence, as the correct calculation for the number of different weights of splits of `7` should consider all possible splits of `7`, such as `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which indeed results in `4` different weights. But for other inputs, this code will not work correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to generate all possible splits of `n` and calculate their weights, then count the number of distinct weights. The provided code does not do this. It simply calculates the number of factors of `n`, which is a different problem.
