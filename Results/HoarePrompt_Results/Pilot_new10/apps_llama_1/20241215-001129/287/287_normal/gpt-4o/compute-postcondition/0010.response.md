To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `i * i <= num`. This condition implies that as long as the square of `i` is less than or equal to `num`, the loop will continue to execute.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is a positive integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`.
- `i` is 2.
- If `num` is 1, then `count` remains 0, otherwise, `count` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * i <= num` must still be true after the previous iteration. Given that `i` is 2, `i * i = 4`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be greater than or equal to 4 because if `num` were less than 4, the condition `i * i <= num` would not be met after incrementing `i` (assuming `i` is incremented in the loop body, which is not shown).

However, we must consider the condition given for `count` and how it relates to `num`. If `num` is 1, then `count` remains 0, but this does not directly affect the loop condition. The critical factor is the relationship between `i` and `num`.

Since `i` is currently 2, and we want the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the next value of `i` (which would be 3, assuming `i` is incremented by 1 in the loop body) squared is still less than or equal to `num`. Therefore, `num` must be at least 9 (since `3 * 3 = 9`) for the loop to potentially execute one more time after the current state.

State: **`num` must be at least 9, `i` is 2, if `num` is 1, then `count` remains 0, otherwise, `count` is 2**
