The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `i` is 2, if `num` is 1, then `count` remains 0, otherwise, `count` is 2.
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `i` is 2, if `num` is 1, then `count` remains 0, otherwise, `count` is 2**
