The code increments the `count` variable by 1. The initial state of `count` is 1, so after the increment, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is not equal to the integer division of `num` by `i`.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is not equal to the integer division of `num` by `i`**
