Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It does not correctly calculate the number of different weights of splits of a given integer `n`.

The problem description asks for the number of different weights of splits of `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements equal to the first element. However, the provided program calculates the total number of factors of `n`, which is a different problem.

For example, for `n = 7`, the program will output `4` (because `7` has `4` factors: `1`, `7`), but it does not correctly identify the different weights of splits of `7`, which are `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with weights `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`, respectively.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate all possible splits of `n`, calculate the weight of each split, and count the number of distinct weights. The provided program does not do this and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Here is a counterexample of n = 8:
For `n = 8`, the different weights of splits are `[8]`, `[4, 4]`, `[3, 3, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, and `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with weights `1`, `2`, `2`, `4`, `4` and `8` respectively. But the weights that actually appear are `1`, `2`, `4`, `8` for a total of `4` weights. The program outputs `4` factors of `8` which are `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`. However, the factors and the weights are coincidentally the same in this specific instance. In other instances, they will likely be different. 

The program will not give the correct answer for other inputs. For example, for `n = 9`, the different weights of splits are `[9]`, `[4, 4, 1]`, `[3, 3, 3]`, `[3, 2, 2, 2]`, and `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with weights `1`, `2`, `3`, `3`, `3` and `9` respectively. But the weights that actually appear are `1`, `2`, `3`, `9` for a total of `4` weights. The program outputs `3` factors of `9` which are `1`, `3`, `9`. However, the factors and the weights are different. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
