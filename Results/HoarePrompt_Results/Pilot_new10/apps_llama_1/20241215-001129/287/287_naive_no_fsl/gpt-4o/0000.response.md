Correctness: **False**

The given program does not solve the problem as described. It appears to be counting the number of divisors of the input number `n`, rather than finding the number of different weights of its splits.

For example, when `n = 7`, the program outputs `4`, which is correct. However, when `n = 8`, the program outputs `4`, whereas the correct output should be `5`.

The issue lies in the fact that the program is not considering all possible splits of `n`. The function `func_1(n)` is only checking for divisors of `n`, which does not cover all possible splits. For instance, the split `[3, 3, 2]` for `n = 8` is not accounted for by the program.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to generate all possible splits of `n` and then count the number of different weights among these splits. The given program does not accomplish this task.

Here's a counterexample: 

Input: `n = 8`
Expected output: `5`
Actual output: `4`

This demonstrates that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore its correctness is `False`.
