Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The program appears to be counting the number of divisors of `n`, which is not the same as the number of different weights of splits.

For example, when `n = 7`, the program outputs `4`, which is correct. However, the program's logic is based on counting divisors, not weights of splits. 

A counterexample can be found when `n = 11`. The possible weights of splits of `11` are:

Weight 1: `[11]`

Weight 2: `[5, 5, 1]`

Weight 3: `[4, 4, 3]`

Weight 4: `[3, 3, 3, 2]`

Weight 5: `[3, 3, 2, 2, 1]`

Weight 11: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

However, the program would output a different number, because it is counting divisors, not weights of splits.

The correct approach would be to find all possible splits of `n` and then count the number of different weights. The given program does not do this, so it is incorrect.
