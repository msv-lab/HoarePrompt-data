Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum length of a substring in the input string that is not a palindrome. Here's why the program works correctly:

1. The program generates all possible substrings of the input string using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the starting index of the substring, and the inner loop iterates over the ending index of the substring.

2. For each substring, the program checks whether it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`substr!= substr[::-1]`).

3. If a substring is not a palindrome, the program updates the `max_len` variable to store the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found so far.

4. After checking all substrings, the program prints the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings if any are found (`max_len > 0`). Otherwise, it prints 0.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the input string itself is a palindrome, the program will print 0 because all substrings of a palindrome are also palindromes.
* When the input string contains a non-palindromic substring, the program will print the maximum length of such substrings.
* When the input string is empty, the program is not expected to handle this case according to the problem description, which states that the input string is non-empty.

The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program:

* For the input "mew", the program prints 3 because "mew" is a non-palindromic substring of itself.
* For the input "wuffuw", the program prints 5 because "uffuw" is a non-palindromic substring of "wuffuw".
* For the input "qqqqqqqq", the program prints 0 because all substrings of "qqqqqqqq" are palindromes.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
