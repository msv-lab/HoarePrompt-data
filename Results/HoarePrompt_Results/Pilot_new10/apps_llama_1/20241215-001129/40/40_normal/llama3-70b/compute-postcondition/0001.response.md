The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, the value of `n` will be between 1 and 50 (inclusive). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, which is the user's input, `n` is the length of `s`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, which is the user's input, `n` is the length of `s`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50**
