According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1` and `j` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.

Given that `j` is now 3, `substr` must be `s[0:3]` since `substr` is defined as `s[i:j]` and we are now considering the next iteration where `j` has been incremented.

If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` must be at least 3 in the next iteration.

Since `j` has changed to 3, but `i` remains the same at 0, the conditions for `s`, `n`, and the relation of `substr` to its reverse have to be adjusted to reflect the new value of `j`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is `s[0:3]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 3**
