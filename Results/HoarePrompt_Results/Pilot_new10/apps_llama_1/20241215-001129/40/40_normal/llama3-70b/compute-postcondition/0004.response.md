According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. If `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute. Given that `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already greater than 0, the condition is already met. The variable `j` will take values from `i + 1` to `n`, so `j` will be at least 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
