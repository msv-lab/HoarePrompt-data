To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state:

- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 3.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `substr` is `s[0:3]`.
- If `s[0:3]` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 3.

Given the line of code:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

Since `substr` is `s[0:3]`, `len(substr)` is 3. The code updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and 3.

Therefore, regardless of whether `s[0:3]` is equal to its reverse or not, `max_len` will be updated to at least 3 if its current value is less than 3. If `max_len` is already 3 or greater, its value remains unchanged.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `substr`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is `s[0:3]`, `max_len` is at least 3**
