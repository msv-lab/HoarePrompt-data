To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`.
- `i` is less than `n - 1`.
- `j` is `i + 2`.
- `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:
1. `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`, which means it's a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+1` (because Python uses zero-based indexing and the end index in slicing is exclusive).
2. The length of `substr` is `len(substr)`, which equals 2 since `substr` is defined as `s[i:i+2]`.
3. The code compares `max_len` with the length of `substr` (which is 2) and assigns the maximum of these two values back to `max_len`.

However, the initial state does not specify the value of `max_len`. Given that `substr` always has a length of 2 (as per its definition), `max_len` will be updated to 2 if it was less than 2. If `max_len` was already greater than or equal to 2, it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`, and `max_len` is at least 2, specifically `max_len` equals `max(previous max_len, 2)`, and this value has been returned at the output state.**
