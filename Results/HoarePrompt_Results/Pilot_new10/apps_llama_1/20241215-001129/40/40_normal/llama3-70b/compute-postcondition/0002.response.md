The code initializes a variable `max_len` to 0. The initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, and `n` is the length of `s`. 

Since `n` is the length of `s` and `s` has a length of at most 50 characters, `n` will be between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The introduction of `max_len` with a value of 0 does not alter the properties or values of `s` and `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `max_len` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `max_len` is 0**
