The given code snippet creates a new variable `substr` and assigns it the value of a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. Since `j` is `i + 1`, the length of `substr` will be 1 (a single character) because `j` is exclusive in Python's string slicing.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes, the code does not alter `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, or `max_len`. It simply creates a new variable `substr` with a value that is a single character from `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes, `substr` is the character at index `i` in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes, `substr` is the character at index `i` in `s`.**
