Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads a non-empty string `s` of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, which matches the input specification in the problem description.

2. The program iterates over all possible substrings of `s` using two nested loops. For each substring, it checks if the substring is not equal to its reverse (`substr!= substr[::-1]`). If it's not a palindrome, it updates the `max_len` variable with the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings found so far.

3. After checking all substrings, the program prints the length of the longest non-palindrome substring (`max_len`) if it's greater than 0. If all substrings are palindromes, it prints 0, which matches the output specification in the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases:

* If the input string is not a palindrome, the program will find the longest non-palindrome substring and print its length.
* If the input string is a palindrome but has non-palindrome substrings, the program will find the longest non-palindrome substring and print its length.
* If all substrings of the input string are palindromes, the program will print 0.

The program's logic is correct, and it does not have any apparent bugs or edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
