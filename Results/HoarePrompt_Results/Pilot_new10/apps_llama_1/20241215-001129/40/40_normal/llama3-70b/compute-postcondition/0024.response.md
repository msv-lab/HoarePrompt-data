According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`, and `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. 

So, `j` becomes `i + 2`. Since `j` is in the range from `i + 1` to `n`, for the loop to execute again, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `substr` is `s[i]`**
