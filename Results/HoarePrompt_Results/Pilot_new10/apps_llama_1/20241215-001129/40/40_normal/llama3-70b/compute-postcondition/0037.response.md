The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is the same as the length of the string `s` from index `i` to the end, but since we don't have this information, we just know `substr` is a substring of `s` and its length cannot be greater than `n - i`. Since `substr` is not a palindrome, the length of `substr` is at least 2 (if it was 1, it would be a palindrome). 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and the length of `substr`, `substr` is the character at index `i` in `s` and is not equal to its reverse.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and the length of `substr`, `substr` is the character at index `i` in `s` and is not equal to its reverse.**
