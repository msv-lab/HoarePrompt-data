Correctness: **True**

The code provided appears to be a correct solution to the problem. It iterates through all possible substrings of the input string, checks if each one is a palindrome, and keeps track of the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The code iterates through all possible substrings of the input string using two nested loops. The outer loop starts at each character in the string, and the inner loop generates all possible substrings starting from that character.
2. For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse (`substr!= substr[::-1]`). If it is not, then the substring is not a palindrome.
3. If the substring is not a palindrome, it updates the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings (`max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))`).
4. Finally, it prints the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings if it is greater than 0, otherwise, it prints 0.

The code handles all possible cases:

* If the input string is a palindrome, then all its substrings are also palindromes, and the code will correctly print 0.
* If the input string contains at least one non-palindrome substring, then the code will correctly find the maximum length of such substrings and print it.
* The code works correctly for strings of length 1, where the only substring is the string itself.

The provided examples also agree with the code's output:

* For the input "mew", the code correctly prints 3, because "mew" is not a palindrome.
* For the input "wuffuw", the code correctly prints 5, because "wuffuw" contains non-palindrome substrings of length 5.
* For the input "qqqqqqqq", the code correctly prints 0, because all substrings of this string are palindromes.
