Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is equal to `s[0]`. If `substr` (which is `s[0]`) is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is 1. Since `s[0]` is a single character and is always equal to its reverse, `max_len` will be 1 only when this condition is met, but given `substr` is a single character, this condition will never be true for any character, thus `max_len` remains 0 in the case of `substr` being equal to its reverse, but since there is no explicit else part handling the case where `substr` equals its reverse, we consider the case where `substr` is not equal to its reverse as specified, yet acknowledge `max_len` would typically remain unchanged if `substr` were indeed a single character and thus always equal to its reverse.**
