Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the changes:

- The variable `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- The variable `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`.
- The variable `i` is less than `n - 2`.
- The variable `j` is `i + 3`.
- The variable `substr` initially is `s[i+1:i+3]`, but this changes with the new assignment.

The code snippet is:
```python
substr = s[i:j]
```
Given that `j` is `i + 3`, this line of code assigns `substr` the value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` up to but not including index `j` (which is `i + 3`). Thus, `substr` now equals `s[i:i+3]`, which is a substring of length 3.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this line of code. The condition regarding `max_len` is dependent on whether `substr` is equal to its reverse, but since `substr` has just been redefined and we do not know its new value, we cannot directly update `max_len` without further information.

However, considering the initial condition for `max_len` and the fact that `substr` is now a substring of length 3 (which could potentially be a palindrome or not), if `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` would indeed be at least 3, because the current `substr` has a length of 3.

The output state is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, and if `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 3.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, and if `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 3**
