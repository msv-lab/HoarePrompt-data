Correctness: **False**.

The code is trying to find the longest non-palindrome substring of a given string. However, it only checks if the string itself is a palindrome, and if not, it returns the length of the string. It also checks if the string without the first or last character is a palindrome, and if not, it returns the length of the string minus one. This approach is not sufficient to find the longest non-palindrome substring.

For example, consider the string "ababa". This string itself is not a palindrome, but none of the substrings "abab", "baba" are palindromes either. However, the code will return 5, while the correct answer should be 4, because "abab" is the longest non-palindrome substring.

The code does not check all possible substrings of the string to find the longest non-palindrome one. It only checks a few special cases, and if none of them work, it returns 0. This is not a correct approach to solve the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check all possible substrings of the string and find the longest one that is not a palindrome. We can do this by iterating over all possible substrings and using a helper function to check if a string is a palindrome. If we find a non-palindrome substring, we update the maximum length found so far. If we don't find any non-palindrome substrings, we return 0. 

Here's an example of a correct solution:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            substring = s[i:j+1]
            if not is_palindrome(substring):
                max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
print(longest_non_palindrome(s))
```
This code correctly finds the longest non-palindrome substring of a given string and returns its length. If all substrings are palindromes, it returns 0.
