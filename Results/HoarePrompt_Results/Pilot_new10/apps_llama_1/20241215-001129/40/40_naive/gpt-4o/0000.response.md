Correctness: **False**.

The given program is trying to find the length of the longest substring that is not a palindrome in a given string. However, it only checks for the entire string and its prefix/suffix substrings (excluding the first or last character) to determine if they are palindromes. 

This approach is not correct because it does not consider all possible substrings of the string. The program will fail for cases where the longest non-palindrome substring is not the entire string or the string excluding the first or last character. 

For example, the string "abba" has a non-palindrome substring "ab" of length 2, but the program will return 0 because it only checks the entire string "abba" (which is a palindrome) and the strings "abba" excluding the first or last character (both of which are still palindromes).

To fix this issue, the program needs to check all possible substrings of the string to find the longest one that is not a palindrome. 

The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome, but the main program logic is incorrect. It should be modified to generate all substrings of `s` and check each of them using `func_1(s)`. If a non-palindrome substring is found, its length should be compared to the maximum length found so far. 

If the program is modified to correctly check all substrings, it will pass all test cases. Otherwise, it will fail for cases like the one mentioned above.
