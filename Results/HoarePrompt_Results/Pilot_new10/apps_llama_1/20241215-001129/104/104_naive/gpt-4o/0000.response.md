Correctness: **False**.

The given program calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the array, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem. 

The correct approach would be to check for each possible subarray of the given array, whether it can be erased and the remaining array can still be restored uniquely. 

For example, consider the array [1, 10, 11, 12]. The program will print 8, which is incorrect because the maximum number of elements that can be erased is 2 (i.e., the subarray [10, 11]).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible subarrays and check whether the remaining array can still be restored uniquely after erasing the subarray. 

Here is an example of how to correctly solve this problem:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            subarray = a[i:j+1]
            remaining_array = a[:i] + a[j+1:]
            if remaining_array and is_restoreable(remaining_array, subarray):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, len(subarray))
    print(max_erase)

def is_restoreable(remaining_array, subarray):
    if not remaining_array:
        return 1 <= subarray[0] - 1 <= 1000 and 1 <= subarray[-1] <= 1000
    else:
        return 1 <= subarray[0] - remaining_array[-1] - 1 <= 1000 and 1 <= subarray[-1] - remaining_array[-1] - 1 <= 1000 and 1 <= remaining_array[-1] <= 1000

func()
