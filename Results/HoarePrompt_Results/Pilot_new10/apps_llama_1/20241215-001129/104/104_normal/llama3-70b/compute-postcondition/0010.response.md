Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`. If the difference between all consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` is equal to their respective index differences, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `n`.***
