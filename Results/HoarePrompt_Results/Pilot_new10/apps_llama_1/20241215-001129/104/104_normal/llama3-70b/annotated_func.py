#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit parameters, but it implicitly takes a list of integers which is strictly increasing, contains between 1 and 100 elements, and each element is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is the maximum length of any arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 in the original list `a` minus 1, or 0 if no such sequence exists or if `n` is 0.
    print(max_erase)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer n and a list of integers a, calculates the maximum length of any arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 in the list a minus 1, and prints this value; if no such sequence exists or if n is 0, it prints 0; however, it does not validate the input to ensure that the list a is strictly increasing or that its elements are within the specified range, and it may produce incorrect results or throw exceptions for invalid input.
