According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 2`. The state of `max_erase` does not need to be adjusted because there is no information provided about how it changes. The state of `a` also does not need to be adjusted because it is not modified by the loop counter.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and the state of `max_erase` remains the same**
