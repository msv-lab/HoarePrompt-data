The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but implicitly takes a list of integers. This list has the following properties: it is strictly increasing, contains between 1 and 100 elements, and each element is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). 

Since the explicit output of this function is not provided, I will assume a general return based on typical operations that could be performed on such a list, considering common patterns in programming tasks.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers with specified constraints and return a value based on the list's properties.

Functionality: **The function accepts a strictly increasing list of integers with 1 to 100 elements, each between 1 and 10^3, and returns a value based on the list's properties.**
