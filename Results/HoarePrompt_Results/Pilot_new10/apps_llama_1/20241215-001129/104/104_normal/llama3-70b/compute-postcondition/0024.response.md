To solve this task, we must analyze the given code and its impact on the variables in the initial state.

`max_erase` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given that `j` is `i + 3`, we can substitute `j` in the equation to get `max_erase = max(max_erase, (i + 3) - i - 1)`. Simplifying this, we get `max_erase = max(max_erase, 2)`.

Since `max_erase` is set to be the maximum of its current value and `2`, and there's no initial value provided for `max_erase`, we consider its initial state as undefined or less than 2 in this context. After the execution, `max_erase` will be at least `2` if its initial value was less than `2`. If its initial value was already greater than or equal to `2`, then its value remains unchanged.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this line of code. 

Given that `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `j` is `i + 3`, these conditions remain true after the execution of the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `max_erase` is at least `2`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0 and greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `max_erase` is at least `2`**
