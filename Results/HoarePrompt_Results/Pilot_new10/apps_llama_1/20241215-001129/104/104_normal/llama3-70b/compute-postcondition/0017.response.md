Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of any arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 in `a` minus 1, or 0 if no such sequence exists, `j` is `i + 1`. The current value of the sequence from index `i` to `j` in `a` forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, meaning that for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the difference between `a[k]` and `a[i]` is equal to the difference between `k` and `i`.**
