To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

Given state: 
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `max_erase` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

Loop statement: `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1)`.

For this loop to execute, we need to consider the range of `j`. The loop will iterate from `i + 1` to `n` (inclusive), since the upper limit in `range()` is exclusive. This implies two conditions for the loop to execute at least once:
1. `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n`, because if `i + 1` is greater than `n`, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
2. Since `n` must be greater than 0 (as given), and `i` is 0, the condition `i + 1 <= n` is inherently satisfied if `n` is at least 1.

Considering `i` is 0, `j` will start from 1 (`i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`) and go up to `n`. 

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be at least 1 (which is already given as a condition that `n` must be greater than 0, so this condition is naturally satisfied).
- `i` is 0, which means `j` will start from 1.
- `a` being a list of input integers does not directly affect the conditions for the loop to execute, but its presence is acknowledged.
- `max_erase` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

So, the state before the loop starts, adjusted for the loop to execute, is:

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` will range from 1 to `n`**
