Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` will range from 1 to `n`. The current value of the list `a` from index `i` to `j` forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, meaning that for all indices `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the difference between `a[k]` and `a[i]` is equal to the difference between `k` and `i`.**
