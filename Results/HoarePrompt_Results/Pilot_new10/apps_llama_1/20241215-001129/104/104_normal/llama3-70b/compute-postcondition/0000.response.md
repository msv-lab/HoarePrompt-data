The given code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. 

The initial state specifies that there is a list of integers which is strictly increasing, contains between 1 and 100 elements, and each element is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). However, this list is not directly affected by the given code, as the code only deals with the input and the variable `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: There is a list of integers which is strictly increasing, contains between 1 and 100 elements, and each element is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive); `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **There is a list of integers which is strictly increasing, contains between 1 and 100 elements, and each element is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive); `n` is an input integer**
