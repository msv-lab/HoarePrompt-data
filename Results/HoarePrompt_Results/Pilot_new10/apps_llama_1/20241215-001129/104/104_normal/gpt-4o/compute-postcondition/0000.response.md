The input to the function is a sequence of integers. `n` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is the number of elements in the array. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is now an input integer representing the number of elements in the array. The array itself is still waiting to be defined or inputted, and its properties (having `n` elements, and the elements being in increasing order from 1 to 10^3) are still valid preconditions.

Output State: **The input to the function is a sequence of integers, `n` is an input integer representing the number of elements in the array (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the next n integers are the elements of the array a (1 ≤ a1 < a2 <... < an ≤ 10^3).**
