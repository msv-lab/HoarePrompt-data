Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from the array such that the remaining elements can still be used to restore the original array. 

However, the program calculates the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the array minus 1. This is not equivalent to finding the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased.

For example, consider the array [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]. The program will calculate the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements as 4 (9 - 5), and subtract 1, resulting in an answer of 3. However, the correct answer is 2, because JATC can erase the third and fourth elements (4 and 5), leaving the array [1, 3, _, _, 6, 9], which can still be restored to the original array.

The program does not consider the fact that the erased elements must be consecutive, and it does not check if the remaining elements can still be used to restore the original array. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a corrected version of the function in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            b = a[:i] + a[j:]
            if b == sorted(b) and all(b[k] + 1 <= b[k + 1] for k in range(len(b) - 1)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i)
    print(max_erase)
```
This function iterates over all possible subarrays of the input array, and for each subarray, it checks if the remaining elements can still be used to restore the original array. If they can, it updates the maximum number of elements that can be erased. This function meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False** for the original program. The correct function is provided above.
