According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute because the range starts from 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `max_erase` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is now 1 (the starting point of the range). 

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a1 < a2 <... < an ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 1**
