The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it seems that the function should be related to the parameters n, pos, l, and r, which are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, 1 <= l <= r <= n.


Let's redefine the function with the correct parameters:
```python
def func(n, pos, l, r):
```
Since the output is not provided, we cannot determine the return value of the function.


If we were to provide a generic output based on the parameters, we could say that the function returns a value based on the given constraints and parameters n, pos, l, and r.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, which are integers, and returns a value based on the given constraints and parameters.**
