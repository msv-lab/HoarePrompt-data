To calculate the output state, let's first understand the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer equal to input integer 1.
- `pos` is an integer equal to input integer 2.
- `l` is an integer equal to input integer 3, and `l` is not equal to 1.
- `r` is an integer equal to input integer 4, and `r` equals `n`.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
```

This code calculates and prints the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`, then adds 1 to this result. The `abs` function returns the absolute value of the number, which is the number without its sign.

Given that `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` equals `n`, and considering the nature of the print statement, the variables' values themselves do not change as a result of this operation; the operation simply outputs a calculated value based on the current values of `pos` and `l`.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, with the additional information that a value equal to `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed (or returned, in a broader sense, as output).

Output State: **`n` equals input integer 1, `pos` equals input integer 2, `l` equals input integer 3 and is not equal to 1, `r` equals `n` and equals input integer 4, and a value equal to `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed.**
