The variable `move_to_l` is assigned the absolute value of the difference between `pos` and `l`. The previous values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are not changed. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer 1, `pos` is an input integer 2, `l` is an input integer 3, `r` is an input integer 4, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, it is not the case that `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`, and `move_to_l` is the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`, i.e., `move_to_l` = `|pos - l|`**
