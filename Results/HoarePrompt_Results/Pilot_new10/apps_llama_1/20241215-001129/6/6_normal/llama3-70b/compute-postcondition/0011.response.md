The function `func` accepts four integer parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` as input from the user, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`. It calculates a value `ans` based on the relationship between these parameters. 

The function first checks if `pos` is less than `l` and if so, increments `ans` by `l - pos`. Then, it checks if `pos` is greater than `r` and if so, increments `ans` by `pos - r`. 

After these checks, the function increments `ans` by the minimum of `pos - 1` and `n - r`, and by the maximum of `0` and `l - 1`. 

Finally, the function prints the calculated value of `ans`. 

The code does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the input process, such as non-integer inputs or inputs outside the specified ranges. 

The code also does not check for any other edge cases, such as when `l` or `r` is equal to `1` or `n`, which could potentially affect the calculated value of `ans`. 

However, based on the provided code, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` as input from the user, calculates a value `ans` based on their relationship, and prints the calculated value, where `ans` is incremented by the distance from `pos` to `l` if `pos` is less than `l`, by the distance from `pos` to `r` if `pos` is greater than `r`, and by the minimum of `pos - 1` and `n - r` plus the maximum of `0` and `l - 1`. **
