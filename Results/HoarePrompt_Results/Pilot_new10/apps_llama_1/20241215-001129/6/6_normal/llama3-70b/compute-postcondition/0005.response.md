Postcondition: **`n` equals the first input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer. Initially, if `pos` is less than `l`, then the initial value of `ans` equals `l - pos` and the initial value of `pos` is less than `l`. If `pos` is not less than `l`, then the initial state of `ans` and `pos` remains unchanged. The current value of `pos` is greater than `r`.**
