The value of `ans` is incremented by `l - pos`. The previous value of `ans` is 0, and the value of `l - pos` is positive because `pos` is less than `l`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `l - pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, `ans` equals `l - pos`, and `pos` is less than `l`**
