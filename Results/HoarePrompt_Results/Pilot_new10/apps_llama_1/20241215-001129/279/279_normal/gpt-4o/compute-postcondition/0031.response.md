The code `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the `cycle` list. Given the initial state, `x` is 1, so 1 is appended to the `cycle` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle and index 1 are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, and `cycle` is a list containing one element which is 1, i.e., `[1]`**
