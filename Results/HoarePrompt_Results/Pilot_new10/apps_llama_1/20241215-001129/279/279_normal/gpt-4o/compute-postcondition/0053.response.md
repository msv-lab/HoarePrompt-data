The value of `x` is appended to the list `cycle`. The value of `x` is `p[2] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` still contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are still lists of integers, `visited` is still a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True` and at least one other value must be `False`, `cycles` is still a list containing at least two elements, `i` is still 2, and `x` is still `p[2] - 1`. However, `cycle` now contains `[2, p[2] - 1]`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True` and at least one other value must be `False`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is 2, `x` is `p[2] - 1`, and `cycle` is `[2, p[2] - 1]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True` and at least one other value must be `False`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is 2, `x` is `p[2] - 1`, and `cycle` is `[2, p[2] - 1]`.**
