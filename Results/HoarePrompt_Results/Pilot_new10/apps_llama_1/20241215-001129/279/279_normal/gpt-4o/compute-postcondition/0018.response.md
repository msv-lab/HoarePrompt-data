To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

The code `x = p[x] - 1` updates the value of `x` based on the value of `p` at the index `x`. 

Given that `x` is initially `p[0] - 1`, we substitute this value into the equation to get the new value of `x`. 

So, `x` becomes `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`. 

All other variables (`n`, `data`, `p`, `b`, `visited`, `cycles`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

The value of `cycle` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` where `p[0]` is not equal to 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and `visited[p[0]-1]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `p[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` where `p[0]` is not equal to 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and `visited[p[0]-1]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `p[0] - 1`**
