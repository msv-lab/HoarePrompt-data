The given Python code `data = input().split()` reads the input string, splits it into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`.

Given the initial state that `input` contains the string representation of the input, which includes the integer `n` on the first line, the sequence of integers `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` on the second line, and the sequence of integers `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` on the third line, we need to consider how the `input().split()` function will process this input.

However, the description implies that the input is multi-line, but the `input().split()` function in Python only reads input up to the first newline character. Therefore, it will only read the first line of the input, which contains the integer `n`.

So, `data` will be a list containing one element, which is the string representation of the integer `n`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`) are not affected because they are not defined in this code snippet, and the input function only reads the first line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` are integers between 1 and `n`, `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` are either 0 or 1, but they are not yet read into the program**
