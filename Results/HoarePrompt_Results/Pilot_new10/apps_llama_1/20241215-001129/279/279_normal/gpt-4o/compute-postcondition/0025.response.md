Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, if `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 0, `x` is the index of the element in the cycle that caused the loop to terminate, and `cycle` is a list containing the indices of the cycle detected starting from `0`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
