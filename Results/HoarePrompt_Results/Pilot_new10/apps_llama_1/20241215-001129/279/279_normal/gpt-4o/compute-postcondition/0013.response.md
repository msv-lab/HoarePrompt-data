The value of `x` (which is 0) is appended to the `cycle` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The `cycle` list now contains one element, which is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, and `cycle` is a list containing one element, which is 0.**
