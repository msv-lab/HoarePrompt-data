The value of `x` is updated to be equal to `i`. The previous value of `x` is the index of the element in the cycle that caused the loop to terminate, but now it becomes equal to `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, if `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, and `cycle` is an empty list `[]`.
