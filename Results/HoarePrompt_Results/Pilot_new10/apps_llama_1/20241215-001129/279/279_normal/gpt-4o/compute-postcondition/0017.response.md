The value of `x` is `p[0] - 1`, and this value is appended to the list `cycle`. The `cycle` list initially contains one element, which is 0. After appending `x`, the `cycle` list contains two elements: 0 and `p[0] - 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` where `p[0]` is not equal to 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and `visited[p[0]-1]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `p[0] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `p[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` where `p[0]` is not equal to 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and `visited[p[0]-1]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `p[0] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `p[0] - 1`**
