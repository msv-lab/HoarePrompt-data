The provided code `input = sys.stdin.read` reads the entire standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`.

Initial State: Input is provided in a specific format: the first line contains an integer `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2*10^5, representing the number of skewers. The second line contains a sequence of integers `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, representing the permutation according to which the skewers are moved. The third line contains a sequence of integers `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, consisting of zeros and ones, representing when to reverse the skewers.

Output State: **`input` contains the string representation of the input, which includes the integer `n` on the first line, the sequence of integers `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` on the second line, and the sequence of integers `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` on the third line, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` are integers between 1 and `n`, `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` are either 0 or 1**
