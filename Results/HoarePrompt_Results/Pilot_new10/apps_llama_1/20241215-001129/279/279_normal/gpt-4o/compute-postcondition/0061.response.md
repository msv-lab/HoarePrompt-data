Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` contains the original detected cycle and the sequence of indices representing the detected cycle and the newly appended `cycle`, `i` is 2, and `cycle` is the list of indices representing the cycle in the sequence defined by `p` starting from index 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
