The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`. Initially, `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`. So, the new `x` is `p[p[p[2] - 1] - 1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True` and `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is 2, `x` is `p[p[p[2] - 1] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is `[2, p[2] - 1, p[p[2] - 1] - 1]`.**
