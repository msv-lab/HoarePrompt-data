The value of `visited[x]` becomes `True`, where `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The state of `n` is still an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` still contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are still lists of integers, `visited` is still a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True` and now `visited[x]` (or `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]`) is also `True`, `cycles` is still a list containing at least two elements, `i` is still 2, `x` is still `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is still `[2, p[2] - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True` and `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is 2, `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is `[2, p[2] - 1]`.**
