The given Python code `p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))` maps the string representation of integers in `data[1:n + 1]` to integers and assigns them to the list `p`. Since `data` contains the string representation of `n`, `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `data[1:n + 1]` corresponds to the string representations of `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`. 

The values of `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` are integers between 1 and `n`, but they are now read into the program as a list of integers `p`. The values of `n`, `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, and `data` are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` are either 0 or 1.**
