Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values, `cycles` is a list containing a single list of indices of a detected cycle, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles where all elements have a corresponding value of 0 in `b`, with the current value of `cycles` being a list with exactly one element.**
