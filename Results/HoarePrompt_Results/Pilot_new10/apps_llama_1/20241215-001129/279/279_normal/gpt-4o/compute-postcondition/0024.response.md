To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is: 
```python
cycles.append(cycle)
```
The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5
- `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`
- `p` and `b` are lists of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` and `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` respectively
- `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle are `True`
- `cycles` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `x` is the index of the element in the cycle that caused the loop to terminate
- `cycle` is a list containing the indices of the cycle detected starting from `0`

Given the code `cycles.append(cycle)`, we can see that it appends the `cycle` list to the `cycles` list. 

Since `cycles` was initially an empty list and `cycle` contains the indices of the detected cycle, after executing the code, `cycles` will contain one element which is the list of indices of the cycle.

The other variables (`n`, `data`, `p`, `b`, `visited`, `i`, `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5
- `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`
- `p` and `b` are lists of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` and `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` respectively
- `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle are `True`
- `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle
- `i` is 0
- `x` is the index of the element in the cycle that caused the loop to terminate
- `cycle` is a list containing the indices of the cycle detected starting from `0`

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 0, `x` is the index of the element in the cycle that caused the loop to terminate, `cycle` is a list containing the indices of the cycle detected starting from `0`**
