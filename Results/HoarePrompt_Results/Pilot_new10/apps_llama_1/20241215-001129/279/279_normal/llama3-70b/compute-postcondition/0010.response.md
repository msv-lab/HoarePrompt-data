Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 0. If `b` at index `i` is 0 and `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is 2; if `b` at index `i` is 0 and `p` at index `i` is equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` remains unchanged. If `b` at index `i` is 1, then `ans` is 1 if `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
