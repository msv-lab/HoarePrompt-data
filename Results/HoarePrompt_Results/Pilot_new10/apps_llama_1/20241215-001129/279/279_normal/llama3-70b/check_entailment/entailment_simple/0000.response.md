Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Misunderstanding of the problem**: The program seems to increment `ans` whenever `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`. However, the problem statement asks for the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the `2n` placements. The current implementation does not consider the actual requirements of the problem.

2. **Incorrect condition for incrementing `ans`**: The program increments `ans` whenever `b[i]` is 0. However, according to the problem description, Pavel needs at least one `b[i]` to be 1 to reverse the skewer. Therefore, simply counting the number of zeros in `b` is not enough to determine the minimum number of changes required.

3. **No consideration for cycles in permutation `p`**: The problem statement implies that the permutation `p` should be a cycle of length `n`, so that every skewer can visit every position. The current implementation does not check for this condition.

4. **No consideration for the minimum number of changes**: The program simply counts the number of indices where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and the number of indices where `b[i]` is 0. However, this does not necessarily give the minimum number of changes required to satisfy the problem conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Check if the permutation `p` is a cycle of length `n`.
2. Count the number of 1s in the sequence `b`. If there are no 1s, Pavel needs to change at least one `b[i]` to 1.
3. Determine the minimum number of changes required to make the permutation `p` a cycle of length `n` if it is not already.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if permutation p is a cycle of length n
    visited = [False] * n
    for i in range(n):
        j = i
        while not visited[j]:
            visited[j] = True
            j = p[j] - 1
        if not all(visited):
            break
    else:
        cycle = True
    cycle = not any(visited[i] and p[i] - 1 == i for i in range(n))

    # Count the number of 1s in sequence b
    ones_in_b = sum(b)

    # Determine the minimum number of changes required
    ans = 0
    if not cycle:
        ans += 1  # Change permutation p to a cycle of length n
    if ones_in_b == 0:
        ans += 1  # Change at least one b[i] to 1

    print(ans)
```
Note that the corrected program still has room for improvement, as it does not consider all possible cases and edge conditions.
