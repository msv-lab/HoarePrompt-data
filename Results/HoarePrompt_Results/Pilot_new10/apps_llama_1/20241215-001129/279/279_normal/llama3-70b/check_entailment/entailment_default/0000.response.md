Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description. The code simply counts the number of indices where the permutation `p[i]` does not match `i + 1` and where `b[i]` is 0, but this does not accurately represent the minimum total number of elements in the permutation `p` and the sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4`, `p = [4, 3, 2, 1]`, and `b = [0, 1, 1, 1]`. The code will output `7`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is `2`, because Pavel can change the permutation to `[4, 3, 1, 2]`, and the sequence `b` remains the same.

Another issue with the code is that it does not check if the permutation `p` is actually a permutation, i.e., it does not check if all numbers from `1` to `n` appear exactly once in `p`. It also does not handle the case where `b` contains all zeros, in which case the minimum total number of elements to change would be `1`, because Pavel can change any element of `b` to `1`.

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to be modified to check the cycle structure of the permutation `p` and the distribution of zeros and ones in `b`, and then calculate the minimum total number of elements to change based on this information.
