The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was 1 if `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`, otherwise it was unchanged. Now, `ans` is 1 more than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than 0. 
The value of `p` remains a list of input integers. 
The value of `b` remains a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits and the current value of `b` at index `i` remains 0. 
The value of `i` remains 0. 
The value of `p` at index `i` may or may not be equal to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 0, `b` at index `i` is 0, `p` at index `i` may or may not be equal to `i + 1`, `ans` is 1 more than its previous value which was 1 if `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1` otherwise it was unchanged**
