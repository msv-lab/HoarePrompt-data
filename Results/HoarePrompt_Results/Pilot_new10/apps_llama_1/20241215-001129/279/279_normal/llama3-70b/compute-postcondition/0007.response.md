Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 0. If the value of `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is 1; otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify it.**
