The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a new value to `b`. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings separated by whitespace, and `map(int,...)` converts these strings to integers. The length of the list is not explicitly constrained, but since `b` was initially a sequence of zeros and ones of length equal to the original value of `n`, we can infer that the input is expected to be a sequence of `n` binary digits (0s and 1s).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, where `b` is expected to be of length `n` containing binary digits (0s and 1s)**
