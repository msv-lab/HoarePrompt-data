The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 from its initial unspecified value. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition "If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is incremented by 1" is already satisfied since `ans` is incremented. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 from its initial unspecified value and `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 1, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` + 1, and `p[1]` is not equal to 2**
