The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `p`, and `b`. `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length `n`. However, the output description for this function is missing.


To provide a complete answer, the output description is necessary. Please provide the output description to accurately determine the functionality of the function.


If we were to describe the functionality based on the given parameters, it would be:


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, p, and b, where n is a positive integer, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and b is a sequence of zeros and ones of length n, but the return value is not specified.**
