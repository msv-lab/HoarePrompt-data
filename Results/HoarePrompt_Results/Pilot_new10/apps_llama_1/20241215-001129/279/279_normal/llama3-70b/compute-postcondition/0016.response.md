According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 2**
