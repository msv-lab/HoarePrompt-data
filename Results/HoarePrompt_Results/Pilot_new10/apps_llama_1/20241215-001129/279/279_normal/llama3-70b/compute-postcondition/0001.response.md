The code takes the input for `p` as a sequence of integers separated by spaces, which are then converted to a list of integers. The previous value of `p` as a permutation of integers from 1 to the original value of `n` is overwritten.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length equal to the original value of `n`**
