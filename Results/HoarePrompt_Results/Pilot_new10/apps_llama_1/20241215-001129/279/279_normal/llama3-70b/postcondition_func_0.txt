The function accepts user input for a positive integer `n`, a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a binary sequence `b` of length `n`, calculates the sum of indices where `p[i]` does not match `i + 1` and where `b[i]` is 0, and prints this sum, without explicit error handling for invalid inputs.
