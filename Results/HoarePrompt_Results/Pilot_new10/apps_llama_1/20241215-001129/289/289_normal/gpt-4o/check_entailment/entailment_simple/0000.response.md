Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in. 

The problem states that the tournament follows knockout rules and that two players can only play against each other if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.

The given program uses the `bit_length()` function, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary. This can be used to find the maximum number of games in the tournament.

The maximum number of games that can be played is achieved when each game results in the maximum possible number of subsequent games for the winner. This is achieved when the number of players in each game is a power of 2.

By subtracting 1 from the result of `n.bit_length()`, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of games the winner can participate in. This is because the `bit_length()` function returns the number of bits necessary to represent the number of players, and this is equal to the exponent of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the number of players. However, since the players in each game are divided by 2 in each round, the maximum number of games is the exponent of the largest power of 2 minus 1.

For example, if there are 2 players, the maximum number of games is 1 (the initial game). If there are 4 players, the maximum number of games is 2 (the initial game and the final game). If there are 8 players, the maximum number of games is 3 (the initial game, the semifinal, and the final game). And so on.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
