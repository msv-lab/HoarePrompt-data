To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code defines a variable `max_games` and assigns it the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. 

The `bit_length()` method in Python returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. 

Given that `n` is an input integer, after executing the code, `n` still holds its input integer value. The new variable `max_games` is introduced, which is calculated based on `n`.

Therefore, the value of `max_games` is directly dependent on the bit length of `n`. Since `n` is an integer, `max_games` will be an integer as well, specifically `max_games` equals `n.bit_length() - 1`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `n` remains an input integer, and `max_games` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `max_games` equals `n.bit_length() - 1`**
