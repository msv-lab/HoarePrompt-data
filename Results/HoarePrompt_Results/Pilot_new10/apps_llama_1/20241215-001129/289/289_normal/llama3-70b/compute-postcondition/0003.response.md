The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it reads an integer `n` from the input. The code calculates and prints the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, minus 1, using the `bit_length()` method. This operation is performed without checking if the input `n` satisfies the condition stated in the annotation (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). 

The functionality of the function is to read an integer `n` from the input, calculate the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, subtract 1 from this value, and print the result. This operation may raise a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid integer. 

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer from the input, calculates the number of bits required to represent the integer in binary, subtracts 1 from this value, and prints the result. If the input is not a valid integer, it may raise a ValueError. **
