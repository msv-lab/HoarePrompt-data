You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately determines whether Kolya's initial game-coin score can be spent buying houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input**: The program starts by reading Kolya's initial game-coin score `n` from the input.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to find a combination of houses, cars, and computers that sums up to `n`. The function iterates through all possible numbers of houses (`a`) that can be bought with `n` coins, calculates the remaining coins after buying houses, and then iterates through all possible numbers of cars (`b`) that can be bought with the remaining coins. 

3. **Checking Combinations**: If the remaining coins after buying houses and cars can be exactly spent on computers (i.e., `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`), it means a valid combination is found, and the function returns 'YES'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function also handles edge cases where `n` is less than the cost of any item. In such cases, it simply returns 'NO' after the loops finish without finding a valid combination.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1`, which is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether a valid combination is found or not.

The program's approach ensures that it checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers, thus accurately determining whether Kolya's initial game-coin score can be spent buying these items. 

Since all potential cases are handled, and the program's logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, representing the initial game-coin score, such that there are non-negative integers a, b, and c satisfying the equation a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, and either a valid combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` exists such that `a * house_cost + b * car_cost + c * computer_cost = n` (in which case the function returns `'YES'`), or no such combination exists (in which case the function does not return `'YES'`).
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and attempts to find a combination of houses, cars, and computers that sums up to `n` using their respective costs. It returns `'YES'` if such a combination exists and `'NO'` otherwise, covering all possible cases where `n` can or cannot be represented as a linear combination of the given costs with non-negative integer coefficients.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
