The code introduces a new variable `computer_cost` and assigns it the value `1234`. The values of `n`, `house_cost`, and `car_cost` are unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, such that there are non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfying the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, and `computer_cost` is `1234`**
