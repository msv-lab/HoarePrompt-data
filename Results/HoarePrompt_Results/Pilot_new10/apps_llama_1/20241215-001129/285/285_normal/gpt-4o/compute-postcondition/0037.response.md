To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the program state before the loop starts.

The loop statement is:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
```
From this statement, we can see that the loop will execute if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than 0. Since the `range` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the specified end value, the loop will execute if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is at least 0.

Given that `remaining_after_houses = n - 2469134` and `car_cost = 123456`, for `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` to be at least 0, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `house_cost` is a fixed value, for `remaining_after_houses` to be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2469134.

The states given before the loop starts are:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 2.
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134`.
- `b` is `(n - 2469134) // 123456`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be satisfied:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2469134 so that `remaining_after_houses` is not negative.
- `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` should be an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- `b` should be an integer starting from 0, iterating over the range defined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

Thus, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2469134.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 2.
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `b` starts from 0 and iterates over the range defined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2469134, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `b` starts from 0**
