According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `n`. If `a` is less than `n // house_cost + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567`, `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be increased by 1, so `a` is 2. The new `remaining_after_houses` would be `n - 2 * house_cost`. The new `b` would be `(n - 2 * house_cost) // car_cost`. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2 * house_cost`, `b` is `(n - 2 * house_cost) // car_cost`**
