The value of `remaining_after_houses` is calculated as `n - a * house_cost`. The value of `house_cost` is `1234567`, so `remaining_after_houses` is `n - a * 1234567`. 

Given that there exist non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfying `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`, the value of `n` can be expressed as this linear combination. 

Substituting `n` in the expression for `remaining_after_houses`, we get `remaining_after_houses = (a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234) - a * 1234567`, which simplifies to `remaining_after_houses = b * 123456 + c * 1234`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is `b * 123456 + c * 1234`, and there exist non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfying `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`**
