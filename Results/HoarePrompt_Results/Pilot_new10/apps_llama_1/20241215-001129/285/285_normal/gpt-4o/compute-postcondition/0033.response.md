Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to 2 * `car_cost`, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, no return value is specified.**
