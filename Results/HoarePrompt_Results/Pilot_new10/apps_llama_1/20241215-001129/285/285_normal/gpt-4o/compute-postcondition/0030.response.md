To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is:
```
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1234567
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `a` is 1
- `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to 0
- `b` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider how `b` changes in the loop and how that affects other variables, particularly `remaining_after_cars`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 1. The loop increments `b` by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `b` would be 2.

Given that `remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, with `b` now being 2, `remaining_after_cars` would be recalculated as `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`.

The condition for the loop to continue is that `b` is within the range defined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. Since `b` is now 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_after_houses` must be sufficient to allow `b` to reach at least 2 without exceeding the range limit.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to 2 * car_cost, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`**
