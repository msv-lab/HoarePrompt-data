To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `house_cost` is `1234567`
- `car_cost` is `123456`
- `computer_cost` is `1234`
- `a` is 0
- `b` is 1
- `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 123456`

At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 1. The loop iterates over a range that depends on `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. For the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `b` is used in the loop to represent the number of cars that can be bought, and considering the loop statement, `b` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration if the loop condition allows it. The loop condition checks if `b` is within the range `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, which means that for `b` to be 2, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be at least 2.

Since `b` has increased by 1 (now `b` is 2), `remaining_after_cars` would also change because it is calculated based on the number of cars bought, which is represented by `b`. Thus, `remaining_after_cars` would be `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is at least `2 * car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`**
