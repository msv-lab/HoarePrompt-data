Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2469134, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and is greater than or equal to 0, `b` starts from 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2469134 - b * 123456`, and the current value of `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, meaning `remaining_after_cars` is perfectly divisible by `computer_cost` with no remainder.**
