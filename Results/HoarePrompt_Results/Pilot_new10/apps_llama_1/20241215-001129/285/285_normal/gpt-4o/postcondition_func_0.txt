The function accepts an integer `n` and attempts to find a combination of houses, cars, and computers that sums up to `n` using their respective costs. It returns `'YES'` if such a combination exists and `'NO'` otherwise, covering all possible cases where `n` can or cannot be represented as a linear combination of the given costs with non-negative integer coefficients.
