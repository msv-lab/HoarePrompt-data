Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the logic to determine whether Kolya's initial game-coin score `n` can be spent entirely on houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's why the code works for every potential case:

- It iterates through all possible numbers of houses that can be bought (`a` ranges from 0 to `n // house_cost`), which covers all possible combinations where houses are bought.
- For each number of houses bought, it then iterates through all possible numbers of cars that can be bought with the remaining coins (`b` ranges from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`), covering all possible combinations where cars are bought after potentially buying houses.
- Finally, it checks if the remaining coins after buying houses and cars can be spent entirely on computers (`remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`). If this condition is met, it means a combination of houses, cars, and computers has been found that sums up to `n`, so it returns `'YES'`.

If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, it returns `'NO'`.

The given examples also validate the correctness of the code. For instance, when `n = 1359257`, the code correctly identifies that one house, one car, and one computer can be bought to spend all the coins, returning `'YES'`. Similarly, for `n = 17851817`, it correctly determines that there is no combination of houses, cars, and computers that sums up to this amount, returning `'NO'`.

The code efficiently covers all cases by systematically exploring all possible combinations of purchasing houses, cars, and computers, ensuring that it does not miss any potential solution. Therefore, it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.
