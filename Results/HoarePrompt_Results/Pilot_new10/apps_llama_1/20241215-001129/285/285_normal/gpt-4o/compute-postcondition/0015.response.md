To calculate the result, we first consider the given Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `house_cost` is `1234567`.
- `car_cost` is `123456`.
- `computer_cost` is `1234`.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is 2.
- `remaining_after_houses` is at least `2 * car_cost`.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```
Since `b` is 2, the equation becomes:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost
```
This means that the value of `remaining_after_cars` is updated to be the result of subtracting twice the `car_cost` from `remaining_after_houses`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, `a`, `b`, and `remaining_after_houses`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `house_cost` is `1234567`.
- `car_cost` is `123456`.
- `computer_cost` is `1234`.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is 2.
- `remaining_after_houses` is at least `2 * car_cost`.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`, which is the same as its initial state because the update rule matches its initial definition, so it's consistent with the equation `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is at least `2 * car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`.**
