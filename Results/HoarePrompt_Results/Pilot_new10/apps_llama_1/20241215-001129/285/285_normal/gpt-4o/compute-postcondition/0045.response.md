Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2469134, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134`, `b` is incremented by 1, and `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2469134 - b * 123456`. If `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no specific return value.***
