Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0, `remaining_after_cars` equals `remaining_after_houses` and is at least 0. The current value of `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, meaning `remaining_after_cars` is exactly divisible by `computer_cost` with no remainder.**
