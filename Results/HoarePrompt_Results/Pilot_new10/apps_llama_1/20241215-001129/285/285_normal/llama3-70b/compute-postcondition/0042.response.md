The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program. When `exit()` is called, the program stops execution immediately. The states of the variables do not change, but the program ends. 

The conditions `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 1234` and `n - 2 * 1234567 >= 0` and `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 >= 1` are still valid, and `c` is still `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 1234`. The string 'YES' has been printed before the program terminated. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the original input integer, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, the program has terminated, `n - 2 * 1234567 >= 0`, `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 >= 1`, `c` is `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 1234`, and the string 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, the program has terminated, `n - 2 * 1234567 >= 0`, `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 >= 1`, `c` is `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 1234`, and the string 'YES' has been printed**
