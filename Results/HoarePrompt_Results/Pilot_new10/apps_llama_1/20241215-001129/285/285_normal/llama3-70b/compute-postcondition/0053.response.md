Postcondition: ***`n` is the original input integer, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `n - 2 * 1234567 >= 0`, `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 >= 3`, `c` is `(n - 2 * 1234567 - 2 * 123456) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n`, then 'YES' has been printed to the console and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged, with `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retaining their original values.***
