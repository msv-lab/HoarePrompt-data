Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is designed to determine if it's possible for Kolya to spend all his initial game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The function `func_1(n)` iterates through all possible combinations of buying houses and cars, and checks if the remaining coins can be spent on computers. If it finds a combination where the remaining coins can be exactly spent on computers, it returns 'YES', indicating that it's possible to spend all coins. If it checks all combinations and doesn't find a valid one, it returns 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all potential cases by:

1. **Iterating through all possible house purchases**: It checks for all numbers of houses that can be bought with the initial coins, ensuring it doesn't miss any potential combinations.
2. **Iterating through all possible car purchases after buying houses**: For each number of houses bought, it checks all possible numbers of cars that can be bought with the remaining coins, again ensuring that all potential combinations are considered.
3. **Checking if the remaining coins can be spent on computers**: If the remaining coins after buying houses and cars can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer, it means there's a valid combination where all coins can be spent, and it returns 'YES'.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the provided program seems to exhaustively search through all possible combinations of purchases that could lead to spending all of Kolya's initial coins. It correctly returns 'YES' if such combinations exist and 'NO' otherwise, aligning with the problem's requirements. Therefore, without being able to find a case where the program fails to work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
