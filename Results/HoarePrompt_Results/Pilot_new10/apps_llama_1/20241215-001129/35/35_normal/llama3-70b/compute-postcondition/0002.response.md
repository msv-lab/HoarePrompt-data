Since the given `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as the program is running, regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `x`. 

The loop condition `while True` always evaluates to true, so the loop body will execute at least once, and it will keep executing until the program is interrupted or it encounters a break statement.

Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the number of people at the celebration, `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`**
