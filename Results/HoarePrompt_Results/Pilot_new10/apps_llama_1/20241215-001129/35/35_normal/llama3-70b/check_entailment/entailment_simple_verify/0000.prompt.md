You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work as expected for all potential cases. For example, if we input `3 4 4`, the program should output `2` because we can distribute the cakes in such a way that each plate has at least 2 pieces of cake (e.g., one plate has 2 pieces of the first cake, one plate has 2 pieces of the second cake, and the last plate has 2 pieces of the first cake and 2 pieces of the second cake is not possible, but 2 plates with 2 pieces of each cake and the last plate with 2 pieces of either cake is possible but this will leave 2 pieces to distribute and the program description allows to have one cake per plate). However, the program outputs `1` because it only checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes so that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake without considering the optimal way to distribute the cakes.

The problem description asks to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate, but the given program does not guarantee to find this maximum value. A correct solution would need to consider all possible ways to distribute the cakes while ensuring that each plate has at least the minimum number of pieces required.

A possible correct solution could involve iterating over all possible values of `x` from the maximum possible down to 1, and checking if it's possible to distribute the cakes so that each plate has at least `x` pieces. The first `x` value for which this is possible would be the maximum possible number of pieces that can be guaranteed on each plate.

Here is a corrected Python program:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    for x in range((a + b) // n, 0, -1):
        if n - (a // x) - (b // x) <= (a % x) + (b % x):
            print(x)
            return

func()
```
This corrected program iterates over all possible values of `x` from the maximum possible down to 1 and checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes so that each plate has at least `x` pieces. The first `x` value for which this is possible is the maximum possible number of pieces that can be guaranteed on each plate.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that n is the number of people (including Ivan) at the celebration, a is the number of pieces of the first cake, and b is the number of pieces of the second cake, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
            break
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the number of people at the celebration, `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake, and `x` is the largest value such that `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x` are all true, which represents the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed under the given conditions.
    print(x)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
