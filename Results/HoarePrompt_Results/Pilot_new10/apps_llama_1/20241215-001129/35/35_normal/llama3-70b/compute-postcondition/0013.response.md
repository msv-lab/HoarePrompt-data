Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of people at the celebration, `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 2. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x` and `b` is greater than or equal to `x` and the total number of remaining pieces of both cakes after distributing `x` pieces is greater than or equal to `x`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
