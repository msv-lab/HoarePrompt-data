Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The while loop condition `a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x` is incorrect. 

This condition checks if both cakes can have at least `x` pieces distributed from each of them, and if the remaining pieces from both cakes combined are at least `x`. However, it does not consider the condition that the total number of plates (`n`) should be utilized.

A correct approach would be to iterate over possible values of `x` from the maximum possible value (the minimum of `a` and `b`) down to 1, and for each `x`, calculate the number of plates that can be filled with `x` or more pieces of the first cake and the number of plates that can be filled with `x` or more pieces of the second cake. The program should then check if the sum of these two numbers is less than or equal to `n` and if each plate can be filled with at least `x` pieces.

Here's an example where the program fails:

Input: `4 7 10`

In this case, `x` should be 3 because 2 plates can have 3 pieces of the first cake (6 pieces) and 2 plates can have 5 pieces of the second cake (10 pieces). However, the program calculates `x` as 2 because it incorrectly checks the conditions.

Here is the correct Python function for the problem:
```python
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    for x in range(min(a, b), 0, -1):
        plates_with_first_cake = min(a // x, n)
        plates_with_second_cake = min(b // x, n - plates_with_first_cake)
        if plates_with_first_cake + plates_with_second_cake >= n and a >= x * plates_with_first_cake and b >= x * plates_with_second_cake:
            print(x)
            return
    print(1)
```
This function correctly calculates the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed under the given conditions.
