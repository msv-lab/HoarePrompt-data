The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` with the input integers. The `map(int, input().split())` expression splits the input string into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object. The `n, a, b` assignment then unpacks the integers from the map object into the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`.

The initial conditions that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b` may not hold after the code execution because new values are assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the fact that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers is still valid.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, where `n` is the number of people at the celebration, `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake.**
