Correctness: **False**

The program does not always correctly calculate the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cakes according to the given conditions. 

The problem with the program lies in the while loop condition `a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x`. This condition does not accurately represent the constraints of the problem.

The correct condition should ensure that each plate contains at least x pieces of cake, and that no plate contains pieces of both cakes. The condition `a >= x and b >= x` is not sufficient, as it only checks if each cake has at least x pieces, but does not consider the distribution of pieces among the plates.

Additionally, the condition `a - x + (b - x) >= x` is not clear and does not seem to be related to the problem constraints.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible distributions of the cake pieces among the plates, such that each plate contains at least x pieces of cake, and that no plate contains pieces of both cakes. We need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies these conditions.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input: `4 7 10`

The program's output is `2`, but the correct output should be `3`, as explained in the problem description.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to rewrite the program to consider all possible distributions of the cake pieces among the plates, such that each plate contains at least x pieces of cake, and that no plate contains pieces of both cakes. We would need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies these conditions. 

Here's a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    max_x = 0
    for x in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):
        plates_with_a = min(a // x, n)
        remaining_a = a - plates_with_a * x
        plates_with_b = min(b // x, n - plates_with_a)
        remaining_b = b - plates_with_b * x
        if plates_with_a + plates_with_b == n and remaining_a == 0 and remaining_b == 0:
            max_x = max(max_x, x)
    for x in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):
        plates_with_a = min((a + x - 1) // x, n)
        remaining_a = a - (plates_with_a - 1) * x
        plates_with_b = min((b + x - 1) // x, n - plates_with_a + 1)
        remaining_b = b - plates_with_b * x
        if plates_with_a + plates_with_b - 1 == n and remaining_a == x and remaining_b == 0:
            max_x = max(max_x, x)
        plates_with_b = min((b + x - 1) // x, n)
        remaining_b = b - (plates_with_b - 1) * x
        plates_with_a = min((a + x - 1) // x, n - plates_with_b + 1)
        remaining_a = a - plates_with_a * x
        if plates_with_b + plates_with_a - 1 == n and remaining_b == x and remaining_a == 0:
            max_x = max(max_x, x)
    print(max_x)
```
This implementation correctly calculates the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cakes according to the given conditions.
