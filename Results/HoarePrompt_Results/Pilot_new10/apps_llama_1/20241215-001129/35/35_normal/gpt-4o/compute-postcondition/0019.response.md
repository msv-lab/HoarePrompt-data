Given that `low` is equal to `high`, and both represent the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, we understand that `low` (and thus `high`) holds a specific value that is considered the maximum under the given conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `n`.

When the code `return low - 1` is executed, it directly subtracts 1 from the value of `low`. Since `low` is the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed, subtracting 1 from this maximum value gives us a value that is one less than the maximum.

Therefore, the program returns a value that is one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the conditions defined by `a`, `b`, and `n`.

Output State: **The program returns a value that is one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.**
