The function accepts a positive integer x, uses global variables a and b representing the number of pieces of the first and second cakes, and n representing the number of plates, and returns True if the total number of plates that can be filled with cake pieces is greater than or equal to the number of plates n, where the total number of plates is calculated as the integer division of a by x plus the integer division of b by x, and False otherwise, assuming 2 <= n <= a + b and x <= min(a, b)
