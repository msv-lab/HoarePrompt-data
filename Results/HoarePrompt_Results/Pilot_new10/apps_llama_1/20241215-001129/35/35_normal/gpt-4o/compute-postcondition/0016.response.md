The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`. Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `high` is now `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is also less than `high`. So when `high` is updated to be `mid`, `high` becomes less than its original value. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the cakes, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the cakes, `low` is less than `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is equal to `mid`**
