The function `can_distribute` accepts parameters `x`, but based on the provided constraints, it seems that `x` is not the only parameter, as the constraints also mention `a`, `b`, and `n`. Therefore, it is likely that the function actually accepts parameters `a`, `b`, `x`, and `n`. 

Given that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cakes, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces on each plate, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, the function returns a boolean value. 

The function returns `True` if the total number of plates that can be filled with cake pieces is greater than or equal to the number of plates, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a, b, x, and n, returns `True` if the total number of plates that can be filled with cake pieces is greater than or equal to the number of plates n, and `False` otherwise.**
