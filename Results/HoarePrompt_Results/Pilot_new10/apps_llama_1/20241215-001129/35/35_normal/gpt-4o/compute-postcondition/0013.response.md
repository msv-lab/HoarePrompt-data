According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` and `high` have been updated based on the value of `can_distribute(mid)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `low` must still be less than `high`. 

Since `low` is updated to `mid` + 1 and `high` is updated to `mid` in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that after the update, `low` is still less than `high`. This means `mid` + 1 must be less than `mid`, which is not possible, or `low` must be less than `high` before the update, and the update must not make `low` greater than or equal to `high`. 

For `low` to be less than `high` after the update, we need `low` to be less than `high` - 1 before the update, because `high` can be updated to `mid` which is (`low` + `high`) // 2, and if `low` is equal to `high` - 1, `mid` will be (`high` - 1 + `high`) // 2, which can be equal to `high` - 1, making `low` equal to `high` after the update.

However, we cannot determine the exact values of `low` and `high` at the end of the previous iteration, but we can say that for the loop to execute again, `low` must be less than `high`. 

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the cakes, `low` must be less than `high`**
