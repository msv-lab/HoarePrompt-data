The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of plates and `a` and `b` are the number of pieces of two cakes. 

Looking at the code, the function uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates. The `can_distribute(mid)` function is not shown in the provided code, but based on the context, it seems to check if it's possible to distribute `mid` pieces into `n` plates given the original values of `a` and `b`.

The code then returns a value that is one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.

However, the code does not handle potential edge cases such as when `n` is less than 2 or when `a` or `b` is less than 1. Additionally, the code does not check if `a + b` is less than `n`, which could also be a potential edge case.

Assuming that the `can_distribute(mid)` function correctly checks if it's possible to distribute `mid` pieces into `n` plates, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of plates and `a` and `b` are the number of pieces of two cakes, and returns a value one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, assuming that `n` is between 2 and `a + b` (inclusive) and `a` and `b` are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the distribution is possible according to the `can_distribute(mid)` function **
