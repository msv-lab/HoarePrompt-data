Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

Here is a case when the program does not work correctly:

Input: 4 5 6

The program's output will be 1. However, the correct answer is 2. This can be achieved by putting 2 pieces of the first cake on two plates and 3 pieces of the second cake on the other two plates. 

The issue with the program is that it checks if `a - x + (b - x) >= x`, which is not the correct condition. It should check if the total number of remaining pieces after distributing `x` pieces to each plate is greater than or equal to the number of remaining plates. 

Here is the correct condition: `a >= x and b >= x and (a - x) + (b - x) >= 2*(n - 2)`. However, the program's logic is incorrect, and it does not correctly implement this condition.

Therefore, the program's correctness is **False**.
