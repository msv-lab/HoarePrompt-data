The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the user's input. The `map(int, input().split())` expression splits the input into two parts, converts them to integers, and returns them as a map object, which is then unpacked into `n` and `k`. 

The initial state describes `n` and `k` as positive integers representing the number of balloons and the number of friends, respectively. However, the code overwrites these values with new ones from the input. The variable `s` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length n containing only lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet, where each letter represents the color of a balloon, but the length of `s` is now unknow because `n` is now an input integer.**
