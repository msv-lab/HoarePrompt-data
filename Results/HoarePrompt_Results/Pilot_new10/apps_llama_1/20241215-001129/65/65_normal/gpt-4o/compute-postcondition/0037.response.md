Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing character frequencies in `s`. If `can_distribute` is `True`, the string 'YES' has been printed. If `can_distribute` is `False`, the string 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
