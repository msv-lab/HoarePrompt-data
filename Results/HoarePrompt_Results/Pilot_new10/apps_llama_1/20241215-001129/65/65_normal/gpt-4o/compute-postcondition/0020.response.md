Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one character, `color_count` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `can_distribute` is `True`, and `count` is the frequency of the first character in `s`. The current value of `count` is higher than `k`.**
