You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks if Kefa can distribute all the balloons to his friends without giving any friend two balloons of the same color. 

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of balloons (n) and the number of friends (k) from the input.
2. It then reads the colors of the balloons from the input string.
3. The program uses a dictionary (color_count) to count the occurrence of each color in the string.
4. It then checks if the count of any color is greater than the number of friends (k). If it is, it means that Kefa cannot distribute the balloons of that color to his friends without giving at least one friend two balloons of the same color. In this case, the program sets can_distribute to False and prints 'NO'.
5. If the count of all colors is less than or equal to the number of friends (k), the program prints 'YES', indicating that Kefa can distribute the balloons to his friends without giving any friend two balloons of the same color.

The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem. If the count of any color is greater than the number of friends, it prints 'NO', and if the count of all colors is less than or equal to the number of friends, it prints 'YES'. 

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For example, in the first example, the input is "4 2" and "aabb", and the program correctly prints 'YES' because Kefa can give the 1st and 3rd balloons to the first friend and the 2nd and 4th balloons to the second friend. In the second example, the input is "6 3" and "aacaab", and the program correctly prints 'NO' because Kefa needs to give balloons of color 'a' to all his friends, but one balloon will be left over. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= k <= 100, and s is a string consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet, where n is the length of s.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `k` <= 100.
    #   - `s` is an input string of length `n`.
    #   - `color_count` is an empty dictionary.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each character `color` in the string `s`.
    #   - If `color` is already a key in `color_count`, its count is incremented by 1.
    #   - If `color` is not a key in `color_count`, it is added as a key with a count of 1.
    #
    #3. **Output States after the loop executes some number of times**:
    #   - These output states indicate the conditions and variable values after executing the loop a certain number of times. They show how `color_count` is updated based on the characters encountered in `s`.
    #
    #Given the loop code and the output states after executing the loop a certain number of times, we can deduce the following:
    #
    #- The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`.
    #- For each character, it checks if the character is already a key in `color_count`. If it is, the count for that character is incremented. If not, the character is added to `color_count` with a count of 1.
    #- The loop does not modify `n` or `k`; it only updates `color_count` based on the characters in `s`.
    #
    #**Final Output State**:
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished, `color_count` will contain each unique character from `s` as keys, with their respective counts as values. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the loop. The string `s` also remains unchanged, as it is only iterated over and not modified.
    #
    #If the string `s` is empty (which contradicts the given condition that 1 <= `n` <= 100, implying `s` cannot be empty), the loop would not execute, and `color_count` would remain an empty dictionary.
    #
    #However, given that `n` and `k` are within specified ranges and `s` has a length of `n`, the loop will execute for each character in `s`, resulting in `color_count` containing the frequency of each character in `s`.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that character in `s`.**
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing character frequencies in `s`, and `can_distribute` is `True` if all frequencies in `color_count` are less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `can_distribute` is `False`.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing character frequencies in `s`. If `can_distribute` is `True`, the string 'YES' has been printed. If `can_distribute` is `False`, the string 'NO' has been printed to the console.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
