You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks if Kefa can distribute all the balloons to his friends without giving any friend two balloons of the same color. 

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of balloons (n) and the number of friends (k) from the input.
2. It then reads the colors of the balloons from the input string.
3. The program uses a dictionary (color_count) to count the occurrence of each color in the string.
4. It then checks if the count of any color is greater than the number of friends (k). If it is, it means that Kefa cannot distribute the balloons of that color to his friends without giving at least one friend two balloons of the same color. In this case, the program sets can_distribute to False and prints 'NO'.
5. If the count of all colors is less than or equal to the number of friends (k), the program prints 'YES', indicating that Kefa can distribute the balloons to his friends without giving any friend two balloons of the same color.

The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem. If the count of any color is greater than the number of friends, it prints 'NO', and if the count of all colors is less than or equal to the number of friends, it prints 'YES'. 

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For example, in the first example, the input is "4 2" and "aabb", and the program correctly prints 'YES' because Kefa can give the 1st and 3rd balloons to the first friend and the 2nd and 4th balloons to the second friend. In the second example, the input is "6 3" and "aacaab", and the program correctly prints 'NO' because Kefa needs to give balloons of color 'a' to all his friends, but one balloon will be left over. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` of length `n`, then checks if the frequency of each character in `s` is less than or equal to `k`. If all frequencies are within the limit, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO', covering all potential cases based on the actual code execution 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
