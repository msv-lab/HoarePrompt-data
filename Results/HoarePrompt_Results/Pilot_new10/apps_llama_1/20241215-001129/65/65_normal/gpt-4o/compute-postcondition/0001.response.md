The input function accepts a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The previous value of `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet with a length of `n`, but it is now overwritten by the input string. The length of the new string `s` should still be `n` to be consistent with the initial state. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= k <= 100, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters provided by the user.**
