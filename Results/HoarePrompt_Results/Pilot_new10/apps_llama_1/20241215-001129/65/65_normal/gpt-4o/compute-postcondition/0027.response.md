Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one character, `color_count` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs. If `count` is greater than `k`, then `can_distribute` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program proceeds without any changes to the variables.***
