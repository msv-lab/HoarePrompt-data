Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, there would be at least one lit garland.

The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garland intervals is divisible by each of the intervals. However, this is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland at each second after switching them on.

A counterexample can be found with the input: 3, 4, 5. In this case, the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60, which is divisible by each of the intervals. However, it is not possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that there is at least one lit garland at each second after switching them on. For instance, if we switch on the garlands at seconds 1, 2, and 3, respectively, there will be no lit garland at seconds 7, 11, 13, and so on.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
