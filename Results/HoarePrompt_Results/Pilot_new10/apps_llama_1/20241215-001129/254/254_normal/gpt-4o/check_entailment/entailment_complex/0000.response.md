Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks to determine if it's possible to switch on three garlands such that during each second after switching them on, at least one garland will be lit. The garlands are lit at intervals of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` seconds, respectively.

The program attempts to solve this by checking if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1. If the gcd is 1, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. However, this approach does not accurately solve the problem.

The issue lies in the fact that having a gcd of 1 among the three intervals does not guarantee that every second will have at least one lit garland. The problem statement provides an example where `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`, and the program should print 'YES' because you can choose `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 2`, and `x3 = 1` such that every second after the maximum of these starting times has at least one garland lit. However, the gcd of 2, 2, and 3 is not 1, which would incorrectly lead the program to print 'NO'.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of starting times (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`) to see if there exists a combination that satisfies the condition that every second after the maximum starting time has at least one garland lit. This would require a more complex algorithm than simply checking the gcd of the intervals.

In summary, the provided program does not meet the problem's requirements because it relies solely on the gcd of the intervals, which is not sufficient to determine if every second will have at least one lit garland. It fails to consider the actual timing and combinations of the garlands being switched on.
