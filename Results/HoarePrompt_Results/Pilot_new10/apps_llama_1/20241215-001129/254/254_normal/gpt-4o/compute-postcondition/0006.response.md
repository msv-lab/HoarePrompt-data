The given code prints 'NO' to the output, but it does not modify any variables. The values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `gcd_k1_k2`, and `gcd_all` remain the same. 

Output State: **`k1` is an input integer, `k2` is an input integer, `k3` is an input integer, 1 <= `k1` <= 1500, 1 <= `k2` <= 1500, 1 <= `k3` <= 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, `gcd_all` is greater than 1, and 'NO' has been printed to the output**
