Correctness: **False**

The given program checks if the three input integers are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1) and prints 'YES' if they are, and 'NO' otherwise. However, this approach does not accurately solve the problem described.

The problem statement requires that during each second after switching the garlands on, there should be at least one lit garland. The program's logic of checking for coprime numbers does not directly address this requirement. 

For instance, consider the input 2 2 3. The program correctly prints 'YES' for this case, as the numbers 2, 2, and 3 can be used to cover all seconds after switching the garlands on. However, the program's logic is based solely on the GCD of the numbers, which does not necessarily guarantee that all seconds will be covered.

A counterexample is the input 4 4 4. The program will print 'NO' for this case, but in fact, it is possible to switch on the garlands at times 1, 2, and 3, respectively, ensuring that at least one garland is lit during each second after switching them on.

To correctly solve the problem, a more complex approach is needed, such as simulating the switching of the garlands and checking if there is a valid combination that covers all seconds after switching them on. The current program does not account for all potential cases and scenarios, making it incorrect.
