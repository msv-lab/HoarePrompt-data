The original assessment states that the program is incorrect, and I agree with this assessment. 

The program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, and prints 'YES' if it is, and 'NO' otherwise. However, this is not the correct condition to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands such that each second after the switching on has at least one lit garland.

The problem requires a more complex solution that involves checking all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verifying if there are any seconds that do not have at least one lit garland. The provided program does not implement this correctly and therefore does not solve the problem as described.

The annotated version of the code describes the state of the program before and after the function call, but it does not change the fact that the program is only checking the GCD of the input numbers, which is not the correct condition to solve the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
