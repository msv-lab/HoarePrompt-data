Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem. It checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals is 1, and if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. However, this approach is not correct.

The problem requires that there be at least one lit garland at every second after the initial switching on. The GCD of the time intervals does not guarantee this condition. For example, consider the case where k1 = 2, k2 = 3, and k3 = 4. The GCD of these numbers is 1, but there will be seconds where no garland is lit.

A correct solution would involve checking if there is a combination of initial switching times that guarantees at least one lit garland at every second. This can be done by checking if the least common multiple (LCM) of any two time intervals is a multiple of the third time interval, or if the time intervals can be combined in such a way that they cover all the seconds after the initial switching on.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input: 4 2 3

The GCD of these numbers is 1, so the program prints 'YES', but there is no way to choose the initial switching times such that at least one garland is lit at every second. The correct output should be 'NO'. 

A correct implementation would involve a more complex algorithm, possibly using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or a similar approach, to check if there is a combination of initial switching times that satisfies the condition. 

Here's an example of a correct solution in Python:

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)

def func():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    
    if lcm(k1, k2) == lcm(lcm(k1, k3), lcm(k2, k3)):
        print('YES')
    else:
        # Check if any two garlands can cover all seconds
        if lcm(k1, k2) == lcm(k1, k3) == lcm(k2, k3):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```
However, this solution also has some issues and a more complex algorithm may be needed to correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. 

The key point is to understand that the GCD of the time intervals is not a sufficient condition to guarantee at least one lit garland at every second. A more complex analysis is required to correctly solve this problem.
