The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `k1` and `k2` and assigns it to `gcd_k1_k2`. The values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are not changed. 

The `math.gcd` function returns the greatest common divisor of two integers. The range of `k1` and `k2` is between 1 and 1500 (inclusive), which means the gcd will also be an integer between 1 and 1500 (inclusive).

Output State: **`k1` is an input integer, `k2` is an input integer, `k3` is an input integer, 1 <= `k1` <= 1500, 1 <= `k2` <= 1500, 1 <= `k3` <= 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`**
