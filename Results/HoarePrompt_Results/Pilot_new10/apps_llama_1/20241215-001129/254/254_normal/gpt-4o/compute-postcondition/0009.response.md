The function func does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it reads three integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` from the input within the range of 1 to 1500. The function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `k1` and `k2` and then the gcd of the result with `k3`. 

The function checks if the final gcd is 1, and if so, it prints 'YES', indicating that the three integers are coprime (i.e., their gcd is 1). Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating that the integers are not coprime. 

Despite the annotations suggesting the function accepts parameters, the actual code does not; instead, it reads input directly. Furthermore, the annotations and return postconditions do not mention what the function does if the input integers are outside the specified range or if the input is not provided in the expected format. 

However, since the function uses `map(int, input().split())` to read the integers, it will fail with a ValueError if the input cannot be converted to integers or if there are not exactly three integers provided. 

The functionality of the function is to determine whether three input integers are coprime and print 'YES' if they are, and 'NO' otherwise, provided the input is in the correct format and within the specified range.

Functionality: ** The function reads three integers from input, checks if they are coprime, and prints 'YES' if their greatest common divisor is 1, and 'NO' otherwise, but may fail with an error if the input is not as expected **
