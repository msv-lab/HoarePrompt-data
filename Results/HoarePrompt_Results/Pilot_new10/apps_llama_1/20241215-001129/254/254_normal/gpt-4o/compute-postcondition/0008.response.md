It appears there is a mistake in the provided problem description. The function `func()` is defined without any parameters, but the parameter constraints mention three integers, `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. 

Assuming the correct function definition should include these parameters, the corrected function definition would be:
```python
def func(k1, k2, k3):
```
With this correction, let's proceed to describe the functionality.

The function `func` accepts three parameters, `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, which are integers representing time intervals of garlands. Each of these integers is constrained such that 1 <= ki <= 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3.

However, the problem description does not specify the output of the function based on these inputs. To properly describe the functionality, we need information on what the function returns based on the values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.

Given the incomplete information, we can only partially describe the functionality as follows:

The function `func` accepts three integer parameters, `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, each within the range of 1 to 1500. 

Without the output details, we cannot accurately complete the description of the functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters, k1, k2, and k3, within the range of 1 to 1500, but the return values are not specified.**
