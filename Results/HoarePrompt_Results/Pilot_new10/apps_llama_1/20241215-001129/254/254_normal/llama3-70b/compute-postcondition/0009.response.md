The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters, a and b. According to the annotated code, it calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. The while loop continues until b becomes 0, at which point a holds the GCD of the original values of a and b. 

Looking at the code line by line, we can see that it indeed implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD. The annotations suggest that the function returns the GCD of the original values of a and b, which is consistent with the code. 

However, it is worth noting that the annotations do not explicitly mention what happens when b is initially 0. In this case, the while loop will not execute, and the function will return the value of a. This is a valid result, as the GCD of a and 0 is defined to be a. 

Additionally, the annotations mention that k1, k2, and k3 are integers such that 1 ≤ k1, k2, k3 ≤ 1500, but these variables are not used within the function. Therefore, they do not affect the functionality of the function.

In terms of potential edge cases, the function should handle cases where a and/or b are negative, as the GCD is defined for positive and negative integers. The Euclidean algorithm used in the function will work correctly for negative inputs, as the GCD of two numbers is the same as the GCD of their absolute values.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), which is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm; it handles cases where a and/or b are 0 or negative, and returns the absolute value of the GCD in these cases, although the code itself works with the actual values of a and b **
