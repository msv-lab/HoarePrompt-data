To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables `a` and `b`, while considering their initial values and the conditions provided.

Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 1 (which is considered True in a boolean context, but here it's used as an integer). The operation `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously assigns the value of `b` to `a` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` to `b`.

Given `a = 1` and `b = 1`, let's compute `a % b`:
- `a % b = 1 % 1 = 0`

So, after the operation:
- `a` becomes `b`, which is `1`.
- `b` becomes `a % b`, which is `0`.

Thus, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on this operation. The integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are not affected by this operation, so their properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `a` is 1; `b` is 0**
