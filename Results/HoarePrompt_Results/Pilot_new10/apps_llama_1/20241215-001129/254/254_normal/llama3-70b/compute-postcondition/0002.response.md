According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is True, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0 (False), which means the loop cannot execute again in its current state. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to True.

State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `a` is 1; `b` is 1 (True)**
