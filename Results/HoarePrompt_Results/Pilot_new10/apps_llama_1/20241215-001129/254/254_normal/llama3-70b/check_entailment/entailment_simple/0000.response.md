Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem asks to determine if it's possible to switch on three garlands in such a way that during each second after switching them on, at least one garland will be lit. The garlands are lit periodically based on their time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` and then checks if `lcm` is divisible by `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. However, this approach does not directly address the problem statement. The problem is not about finding the LCM or checking divisibility but about ensuring that at least one garland is lit every second after switching them on.

The calculation of the LCM and the subsequent checks do not guarantee that the conditions for having at least one garland lit every second are met. The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the actual periods at which the garlands will be lit or how their on/off patterns overlap over time.

For example, consider the input `2 3 4`. The program will calculate the LCM and perform the divisibility checks, but it does not analyze how the garlands' lighting patterns interact. Specifically, it does not verify that there will be at least one garland lit in every second after the maximum of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`. This oversight means the program can return incorrect results for certain inputs.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to simulate the lighting patterns of the garlands over time, considering all possible initial switch-on times (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`), and verify that there is always at least one garland lit in every second after the maximum switch-on time. The provided program does not implement this necessary logic, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
