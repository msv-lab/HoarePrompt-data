Correctness: **False**

The code is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three integers and checking if it is divisible by each of the integers. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem requires that there be at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on. The code's approach does not guarantee this condition. 

For example, consider the case where the input is 4 4 5. The LCM of 4, 4, and 5 is 20, which is divisible by 4 and 4, but the code will print 'NO' because 20 is divisible by 5. However, if we choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, and x3 = 1, the first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 5, 9, 13, 17,..., the second garland will be lit during seconds 2, 6, 10, 14, 18,..., and the third garland will be lit during seconds 1, 6, 11, 16, 21,.... There will be at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on.

This example demonstrates that the code does not handle all cases correctly. The code should check all possible combinations of x1, x2, and x3 to ensure that there is at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible combinations of x1, x2, and x3, and verifying that there is at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on. The code should also handle cases where the LCM is not divisible by one of the integers, as the example above shows. 

The given code only checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the integers, which is not sufficient to guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
