The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), which is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm; it handles cases where a and/or b are 0 or negative, and returns the absolute value of the GCD in these cases, although the code itself works with the actual values of a and b
