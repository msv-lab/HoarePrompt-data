You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue is that it simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, but it does not consider whether the positions of these letters form a "pretty set" according to the problem description.

A counterexample is the string "aAa". The program would return 2, but the correct answer is 1 because there is an uppercase letter 'A' between the first and last 'a', so the positions of all three 'a's cannot be included in a pretty set. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check all possible subsets of the positions of lowercase letters and verify whether each subset meets the conditions of a "pretty set". The current program does not do this, so it is incorrect. 

Here is a high-level idea of a correct solution:
- Find all positions of lowercase letters in the string.
- For each subset of these positions, check if all letters at these positions are distinct and if there are no uppercase letters between any two positions.
- Keep track of the maximum size of a subset that meets these conditions.

This can be implemented using bit masking or recursion to generate all subsets. The current program does not implement this logic and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func() takes no explicit parameters, but uses variables that are defined before it's called. These variables are n, an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, and s, a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, with a length of n characters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input from the user, counts the number of lowercase characters in the string `s`, and prints this count. The input `n` is not used within the function. The function does not handle any potential errors that might occur during input, such as non-integer input for `n` or a string `s` that does not match the expected length or character set.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
