Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements in a "pretty set" of positions in a given string, where a pretty set means that all characters at these positions are lowercase and distinct, and there are no uppercase letters between these positions. 

However, the code simply counts the total number of lowercase characters in the string and prints this count, without considering the conditions for a "pretty set". This means that the code does not handle cases where there are uppercase letters between lowercase characters, or where there are duplicate lowercase characters.

For example, given the input "11 aaaaBaabAbA", the code will print "7", which is the total number of lowercase characters in the string. However, according to the problem description, the maximum number of elements in a pretty set for this input is "2", because we can choose positions 6 and 8 (or 7 and 8), where the characters are 'a' and 'b', and there are no uppercase letters between them. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
