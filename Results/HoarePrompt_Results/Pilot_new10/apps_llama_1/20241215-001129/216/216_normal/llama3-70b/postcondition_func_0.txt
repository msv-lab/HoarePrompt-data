The function takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input from the user, counts the number of lowercase characters in the string `s`, and prints this count. The input `n` is not used within the function. The function does not handle any potential errors that might occur during input, such as non-integer input for `n` or a string `s` that does not match the expected length or character set.
