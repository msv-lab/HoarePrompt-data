Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least 1 character. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains the first character in the string `s`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is in `current_set`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and already in `current_set`, then `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set except for the case where char was already added, `current_count` is 0 or 1 if char was added, and `char` is the first character in the string `s`. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, and `char` is the first character in the string `s` which is not a lowercase letter.**
