The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the character `char` to the set `current_set`. 

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`. 

After executing the code, the state of `n` and `s` remains the same, but `current_set` now includes `char`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least one more character, `char` is the next character in the updated `s`, `current_set` includes `char`**
