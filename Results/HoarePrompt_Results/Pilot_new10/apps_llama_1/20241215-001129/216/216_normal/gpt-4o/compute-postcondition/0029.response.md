The code `current_set.clear()` removes all elements from the `current_set`. 

The values of `n`, `s`, `char`, and `max_count` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`, `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, and `current_set` is empty**
