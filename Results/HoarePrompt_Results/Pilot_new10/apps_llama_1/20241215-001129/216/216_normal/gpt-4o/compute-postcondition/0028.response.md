The given code `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)` updates the value of `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200 and `s` must have at least one more character, and `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`, these conditions are not affected by the given code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`, and `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`, and `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`**
