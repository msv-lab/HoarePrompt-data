The code resets `current_count` to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string and is not a lowercase letter.
