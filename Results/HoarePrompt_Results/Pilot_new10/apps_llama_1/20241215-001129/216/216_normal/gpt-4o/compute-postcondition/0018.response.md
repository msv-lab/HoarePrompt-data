The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is considered from the next character onwards and must have at least one more character, `char` will be the next character in the updated `s`, `current_set` includes the current `char`, `current_count` is incremented by 1, and `max_count` remains the same as before the code execution.
