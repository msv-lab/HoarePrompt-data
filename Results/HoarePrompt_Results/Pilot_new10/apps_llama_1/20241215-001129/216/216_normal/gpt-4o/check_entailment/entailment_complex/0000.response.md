Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It reads a string `s` and finds the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters that can be selected such that there are no uppercase letters between any two selected positions.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
2. If the character is a lowercase letter and it has not been encountered before in the current segment (i.e., it is not in `current_set`), it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`.
3. If the character is an uppercase letter, it updates `max_count` to be the maximum of `max_count` and `current_count`, and then resets `current_set` and `current_count` to start a new segment.
4. After iterating through all characters in `s`, it updates `max_count` one last time to account for the case where the last character in `s` is a lowercase letter.
5. Finally, it prints `max_count`, which represents the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters that can be selected according to the problem description.

The program correctly handles various edge cases, including:

* Strings with no lowercase letters (e.g., "ABC"): `max_count` will remain 0.
* Strings with a single segment of lowercase letters (e.g., "abc"): `max_count` will be the number of distinct lowercase letters in that segment.
* Strings where the last character is a lowercase letter (e.g., "abC"): `max_count` will be updated correctly after the loop to account for the last segment.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly finds the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters that can be selected according to the given conditions.
