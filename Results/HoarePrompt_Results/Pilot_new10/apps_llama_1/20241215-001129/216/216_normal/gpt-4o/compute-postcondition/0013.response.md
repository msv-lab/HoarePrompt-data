The code `current_set.clear()` clears the `current_set`, which means all elements are removed from the set. 

The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

So, `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is still a string of length `n`, `max_count` is still 0, `current_count` is still 0, and `char` is still the first character in the string and is not a lowercase letter.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string and is not a lowercase letter**
