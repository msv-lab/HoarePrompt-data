The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will be processing two inputs: 

1. A positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200)
2. A string `s` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Since the function does not explicitly accept these parameters, it is assumed that these values are either predefined or will be inputted within the function itself.

Given that there are no specified return values or output cases provided in the problem description, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be completely described in terms of its return value. 

However, a partial description of the functionality can be provided based on the input parameters:
Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer n and a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.**
