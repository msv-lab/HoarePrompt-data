Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue is that it simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, but it does not consider whether the positions of these letters form a "pretty set" according to the problem description.

A counterexample is the string "aAa". The program would return 2, but the correct answer is 1 because there is an uppercase letter 'A' between the first and last 'a', so the positions of all three 'a's cannot be included in a pretty set. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check all possible subsets of the positions of lowercase letters and verify whether each subset meets the conditions of a "pretty set". The current program does not do this, so it is incorrect. 

Here is a high-level idea of a correct solution:
- Find all positions of lowercase letters in the string.
- For each subset of these positions, check if all letters at these positions are distinct and if there are no uppercase letters between any two positions.
- Keep track of the maximum size of a subset that meets these conditions.

This can be implemented using bit masking or recursion to generate all subsets. The current program does not implement this logic and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.
