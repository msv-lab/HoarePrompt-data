The given Python code snippet declares a new empty list `potential_sales_increase`. This does not affect the existing variables `n`, `f`, `days`, or `regular_sales`. The initial state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is an empty list, and `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list**
