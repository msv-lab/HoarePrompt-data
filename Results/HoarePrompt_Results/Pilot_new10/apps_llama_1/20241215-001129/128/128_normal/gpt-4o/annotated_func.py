#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= f <= n, and days is a list of n pairs of non-negative integers, where each pair represents the number of products and the number of clients on a particular day.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of each pair of values from `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the corresponding potential sales increases for each pair, calculated as `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each pair `k` and `l` in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns the sum of the minimum sales from each day plus the sum of the f largest potential sales increases, where f is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, the number of days.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n, f, and days, and returns the sum of the minimum sales from each day plus the sum of the f largest potential sales increases, handling cases where n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, and days is a list of n pairs of non-negative integers, but may behave unexpectedly for invalid input values.
