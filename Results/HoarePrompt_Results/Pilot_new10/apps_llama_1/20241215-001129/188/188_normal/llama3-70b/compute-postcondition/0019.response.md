Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` equals `a[1]`, `d` is a dictionary containing at least `a[0]` and `i` as keys. If `i` is in `d`, then `d[i]` equals the previous value of `d[i]` plus one. Otherwise, `d` contains `i` as a key with a value of 1.**
