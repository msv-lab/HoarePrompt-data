Given the initial state, the code snippet `print(a1, a2)` will print the values of `a1` and `a2` to the console. The initial state specifies that `a1` and `a2` are the first and second elements in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`. Since the values of `a1` and `a2` are being printed, their values are now output to the console, but this does not change their values within the program state.

The values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `i`, `c`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged as the `print` statement does not modify these variables. The state of having printed 'YES' to the console also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the last key in `d`, `c` is 0 or 1, `a1` is the first element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`, `a2` is the second element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and `a1` and `a2` have been printed to the console**
