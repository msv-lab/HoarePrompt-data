The code assigns the value of `i` to `a1`. Since `i` is the third key in `d`, `a1` is now equal to the third key in `d`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), 
`a` is still a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, 
`d` is still a dictionary with at least 3 keys where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, 
`i` is still the third key in `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 keys where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the third key in `d`, `a1` is equal to `i`, which is the third key in `d`.**
