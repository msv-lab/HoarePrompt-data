The given code snippet is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or switch statement that it is directly inside. Since there are no changes made to the variables in the given code snippet, all the variables will retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 keys where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the third key in `d`, `a2` is equal to `i`, which is the third key in `d`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
