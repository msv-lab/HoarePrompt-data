Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly solve the problem as per the given description. It reads the number of cards `n` and then reads the integers written on each card. It counts the frequency of each integer using a dictionary `d`. Then, it iterates over the dictionary to find two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. If such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by these two integers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The code correctly handles the cases where the two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times are found, and it also handles the case where no such integers are found. 

Additionally, the code does not assume any specific properties of the input other than `n` being even, as stated in the problem description. 

The output hints agree with the code and do not provide any evidence that the code does not work as expected. The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the code.

Therefore, the code seems to be correct for every potential case.
