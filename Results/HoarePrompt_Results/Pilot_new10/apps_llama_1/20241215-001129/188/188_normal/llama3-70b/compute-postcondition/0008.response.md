Based on the provided output states after the loop executes a few times and focusing on the loop code, we can determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). In each iteration, it appends an input integer to the list `a`. 

After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be `n-1` because the `range` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value, and the loop iterates `n` times. 

The list `a` will contain `n` integer elements, where each element is an input integer.

If `n` is 0 or an odd number, or if `n` is less than 2 or greater than 100, the initial conditions are not met, and the loop's behavior may not match the provided output states. However, given the initial state that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), we can conclude that the loop will execute `n` times.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements where each element is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`.**
