Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case because it does not consider the scenario where there are more than two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. In such a case, the program will only print the first two integers it encounters, even though there may be other pairs of integers that also satisfy the condition.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where there are multiple pairs of integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times and have different values. The program will only print the first pair it encounters, even though there may be other pairs that also satisfy the condition.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1
2
1
2
```
The program will print:
```
YES
1 2
```
But if the input is:
```
4
1
2
3
4
```
The program will not be able to find two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, and it will print:
```
NO
```
However, if the input is:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
The program will print:
```
YES
1 2
```
But if we add another pair of integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, such as:
```
4
1
1
2
2
3
3
4
4
```
The program will only print the first pair it encounters, which is `(1, 2)`, even though `(3, 4)` is also a valid pair.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle these additional cases and to print all pairs of integers that satisfy the condition, not just the first pair it encounters. 

However, for the given problem statement and provided example inputs, the current implementation should produce the expected output. It assumes that there will always be at most two numbers with a frequency of `n/2`, as seen in the examples provided. But this assumption may not hold for all possible inputs, and hence the code has limited correctness.
