Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 1 key where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, initially `c` was 0, `a1` was -1, `a2` was -1, `i` is the first key in `d`. The current value of `d[i]` equals half of `n`, meaning the frequency of the element `i` in `a` is exactly half of the total number of elements in `a`. The current value of `c` is 0**
