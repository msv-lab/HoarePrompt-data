Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input as specified in the problem description. It first reads an even integer `n` representing the number of cards, followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Counting Card Frequencies**: The program then creates a dictionary `d` where each key is a unique number from the cards, and its corresponding value is the frequency of that number among the cards. This step is crucial for determining if there are two distinct numbers that each appear exactly `n/2` times, which is a requirement for a fair game.

3. **Finding Suitable Numbers**: The program iterates through the dictionary `d` to find numbers that appear exactly `n/2` times. It keeps track of the first and second such numbers it finds (in variables `a1` and `a2`, respectively) and breaks out of the loop once it has found two such numbers.

4. **Output**: If the program finds two distinct numbers that each appear `n/2` times, it prints "YES" followed by these two numbers, indicating a fair game is possible. If no such pair of numbers is found after checking all card numbers, it prints "NO", indicating a fair game is not possible.

The program's logic and implementation align with the problem's requirements. It checks all possible numbers on the cards, and its output is consistent with the definition of a fair game as provided in the problem description.

For every potential case:
- If there exist two distinct numbers that each appear `n/2` times, the program will find them and print "YES" along with these numbers, allowing for a fair game.
- If no such pair exists, the program will correctly print "NO", indicating that a fair game is impossible.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
