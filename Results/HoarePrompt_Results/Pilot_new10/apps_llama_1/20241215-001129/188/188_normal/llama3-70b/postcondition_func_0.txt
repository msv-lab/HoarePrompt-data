The function reads an even integer `n` and `n` integers, counts the frequency of each integer, and prints 'YES' followed by the first two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times if such integers exist, otherwise prints 'NO', assuming the input meets certain criteria, but does not perform error checking on the input.
