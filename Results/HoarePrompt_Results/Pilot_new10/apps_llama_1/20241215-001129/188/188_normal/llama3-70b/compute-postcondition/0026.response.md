The code introduces two new variables `a1` and `a2`, assigning them both the value `-1`. The existing variables `n`, `a`, `i`, `d`, and `c` are not modified by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the last element in `a`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, and `a2` is -1**
