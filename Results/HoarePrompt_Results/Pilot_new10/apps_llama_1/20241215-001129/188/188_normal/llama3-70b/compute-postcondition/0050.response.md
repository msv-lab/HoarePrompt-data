Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 keys where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the third key in `d`. If `d[i]` equals `n // 2`, then either `a1` is equal to `i` and `c` is increased by 1 if `c` is 0, or `a2` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `c` is not 0. If `d[i]` does not equal `n // 2`, then no changes are made.***
