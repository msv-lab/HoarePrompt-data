The code `a.append(int(input()))` appends an integer input by the user to the list `a`. The initial state of `a` is a list containing one integer element which is an input integer. 

After executing the code, the list `a` will contain two integer elements: the initial input integer and the new input integer. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing two integer elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is another input integer, `i` is 1**
