Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the rules specified in the problem description for determining whether Petya and Vasya can choose integers before the game so that the game is fair.

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:** The program starts by reading an even integer `n` followed by `n` integers. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Counting Frequencies:** It then counts the frequency of each integer using a dictionary `d`. This is a key step in determining if there are integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, which is crucial for a fair game.

3. **Finding Integers for a Fair Game:** The program then iterates over the dictionary `d` to find integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. It keeps track of the first two such integers found (`a1` and `a2`). If at least two such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by these integers, indicating that a fair game is possible.

4. **Handling Impossible Cases:** If less than two integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times are found, it prints 'NO', correctly indicating that a fair game is not possible under the given conditions.

The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description:

- It checks for the existence of at least two different integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, which is necessary for a fair game.
- It only prints 'YES' followed by the integers if such a pair exists, ensuring that the output matches the problem's requirements for a fair game.
- It handles the case where no such pair exists by printing 'NO', aligning with the problem's requirement for indicating when a fair game is impossible.

The only potential improvement could be adding input validation to ensure that `n` is indeed an even number and that all subsequent inputs are valid integers within the specified range. However, the problem description guarantees these conditions, so the program is correct under the assumption that the input will always meet these criteria.
