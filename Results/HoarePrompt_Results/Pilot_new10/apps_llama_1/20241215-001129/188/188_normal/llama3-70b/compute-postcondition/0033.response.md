The value of `a2` is updated to be equal to `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 1 key where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to the first key in `d`, which is `i`, `i` is the first key in `d`. The current value of `d[i]` equals half of `n`, meaning the frequency of the element `i` in `a` is exactly half of the total number of elements in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 1 key where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, `i` is the first key in `d` and `d[i]` equals `n/2`.**
