The code `a2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `a2`. The value of `i` is the second key in `d`. 

The states of `n`, `a`, `d`, and `i` are not affected by this code.

If `d[first key]` equals half of `n`, then if `c` was initially 0, `c` is 1 and `a1` is the first key in `d`. If `c` was not initially 0, then `c` is not equal to 0 and `a1` is -1. In both cases, `a2` was initially either -1 or the first key in `d`, but is now `i`.

If `d[first key]` does not equal half of `n`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, except for `a2`, which becomes `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the second key in `d`, if `d[first key]` equals half of `n`, then if `c` was initially 0, `c` is 1, `a1` is the first key in `d`, and `a2` is the second key in `d`, if `c` was not initially 0, then `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, and `a2` is the second key in `d`, if `d[first key]` does not equal half of `n`, then `a2` is the second key in `d`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the second key in `d`, if `d[first key]` equals half of `n`, then if `c` was initially 0, `c` is 1, `a1` is the first key in `d`, and `a2` is `i`, if `c` was not initially 0, then `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, and `a2` is `i`, if `d[first key]` does not equal half of `n`, then `a1` and `c` remain unchanged and `a2` is `i`.**
