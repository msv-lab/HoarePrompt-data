The new variable `unique_numbers` is assigned the value of a sorted list of keys from the `count` dictionary, with the sorting based on the values of these keys (i.e., their counts in the `cards` list). The states of the other variables (`n`, `cards`, `count`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` input integers, `count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique integers from `cards` and values are their respective counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their counts.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` input integers, `count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique integers from `cards` and values are their respective counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their counts**
