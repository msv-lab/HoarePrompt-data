Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` input integers, `count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique integers from `cards` and values are their respective counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their counts, the number of unique integers in `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, and it is not the case that the count of the most frequent integer (`unique_numbers[-1]`) equals `n // 2` and the count of the second most frequent integer (`unique_numbers[-2]`) equals `n // 2`.**
