Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It first reads the even number `n` and then reads `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. The program counts the occurrences of each number: It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each number in the list of cards.

3. The program sorts the unique numbers by their counts: It sorts the unique numbers in ascending order of their counts. This is necessary to find the numbers with the smallest and largest counts.

4. The program checks if there are at least two unique numbers: If there are less than two unique numbers, the program prints "NO" because Petya and Vasya need to choose distinct numbers.

5. The program checks if the counts of the two most frequent numbers are equal to `n // 2`: If the counts of the two most frequent numbers are equal to `n // 2`, it means that Petya and Vasya can take all `n` cards and the game will be fair. In this case, the program prints "YES" along with the two numbers.

6. The program handles all possible cases: The program correctly handles cases where there are less than two unique numbers, where the counts of the two most frequent numbers are not equal to `n // 2`, and where the counts of the two most frequent numbers are equal to `n // 2`.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
