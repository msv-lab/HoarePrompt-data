Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` input integers, `count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique integers from `cards` and values are their respective counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their counts. If `unique_numbers` has less than 2 unique integers, the string 'NO' has been printed. If `unique_numbers` has 2 or more unique integers, then if `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` equals `n // 2` and `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` equals `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed to the console along with `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`, otherwise 'NO' has been printed to the console.***
