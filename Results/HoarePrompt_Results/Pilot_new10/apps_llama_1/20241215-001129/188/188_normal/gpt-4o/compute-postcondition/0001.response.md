The code takes an input of `n` integers, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). This input is stored in the list `cards`. 

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The list `cards` now holds `n` integer values, each obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` input integers**
