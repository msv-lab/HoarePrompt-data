Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 

The program works as follows:

1. It first reads the number of cards `n` and then reads the numbers written on each card.
2. It creates a dictionary `d` where the keys are the unique numbers written on the cards and the values are the counts of each number.
3. It then iterates over the dictionary and checks if there are two numbers that appear exactly `n/2` times (since `n` is even).
4. If it finds such two numbers, it prints "YES" and the two numbers. If not, it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly checks for the existence of two numbers that appear exactly `n/2` times, which is the condition for a fair game. If such numbers are found, it prints them; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program also handles edge cases, such as when there are no two numbers that appear exactly `n/2` times, or when there is only one unique number on all cards. 

All the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program, and no counterexamples can be found. Therefore, the program is correct.
