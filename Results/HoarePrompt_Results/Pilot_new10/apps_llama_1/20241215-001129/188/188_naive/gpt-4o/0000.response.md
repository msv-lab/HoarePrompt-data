Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, consider a case where there are more than two unique numbers, and the sum of the counts of the two most frequent numbers is equal to `n`. However, the counts of these two numbers are not equal to `n // 2`. The program should still print 'YES' and the two numbers, but it does not.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
4
1
2
2
3
```
In this case, there are three unique numbers (1, 2, 3), and their counts are (1, 2, 1) respectively. Although there are no two numbers with counts equal to `n // 2`, the numbers 1 and 3 can be chosen to make the game fair. However, the given program will print 'NO' in this case, because it only checks if the two most frequent numbers have counts equal to `n // 2`.

The program should be modified to check all pairs of unique numbers, not just the two most frequent ones, to see if their counts sum up to `n`. 

Here is a modified version of the program:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = list(count.keys())
    for i in range(len(unique_numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_numbers)):
            if count[unique_numbers[i]] + count[unique_numbers[j]] == n and count[unique_numbers[i]] == n // 2:
                print('YES')
                print(unique_numbers[i], unique_numbers[j])
                return
    print('NO')
```
