Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, initially `rated` was `False`, initially `unrated` was `False` if there exists a `j` in range(1, n) such that `ratings_before[0] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[0] > ratings_after[j]`, `True` otherwise, and initially `maybe` was `True`. The current value of `unrated` is `False`, meaning there exists a `j` in range(1, n) such that `ratings_before[0] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[0] > ratings_after[j]`.**
