Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers. If the value at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the value at index `j` in `ratings_before` and the value at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the value at index `j` in `ratings_after`, then `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If this condition is not met, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `rated` being `False`, `unrated` being `True`, and `maybe` being `True`.***
