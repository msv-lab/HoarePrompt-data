To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions that must be met before the loop starts. The loop iterates over a range from `i + 1` to `n`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers
- `rated` is `False`
- `maybe` is `True`

For the loop to execute, `j` must have a value to start with, and the range `i + 1` to `n` must have at least one iteration. This means `i + 1` must be less than `n`. Given `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, this condition is initially satisfied because `1 + 1` (which equals 2) is indeed less than `n` when `n` is greater than 1.

So, before the loop starts, the state adjustments needed for the loop to potentially execute are:

- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure there is at least one iteration.
- `i` is given as 1, which is sufficient for the loop to start since `i + 1` will be 2, and as long as `n` is greater than 1, there will be iterations.
- `j` will take its first value from `i + 1`, which is 2, since `i` is 1.
- The states of `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `rated`, and `maybe` do not affect the execution condition of the loop directly. However, they are part of the program state.

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop starts, taking into account what's necessary for the loop to execute, is:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`**
