The code is a break statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
