According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again, since the loop iterates over the range `i + 1` to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`**
