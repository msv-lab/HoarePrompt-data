Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle other conditions.***
