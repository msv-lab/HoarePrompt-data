The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers where the element at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the element at index `j` in `ratings_before`, and the element at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the element at index `j` in `ratings_after`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, and `unrated` is `False`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers where the element at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the element at index `j` in `ratings_before`, and the element at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the element at index `j` in `ratings_after`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers where the element at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the element at index `j` in `ratings_before`, and the element at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the element at index `j` in `ratings_after`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
