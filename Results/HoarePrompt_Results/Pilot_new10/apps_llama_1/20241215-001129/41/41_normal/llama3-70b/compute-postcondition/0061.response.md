According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False` or remains unchanged, `maybe` is `True` or remains unchanged, `unrated` is `False` or remains unchanged**
