According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 5. Also, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 5 because the loop iterates over the range `i + 1` to `n`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers**
