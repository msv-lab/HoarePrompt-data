To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given Python code affects it. The initial state is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` is a list containing three instances of `a`, and `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of `b`.

Given the Python code snippet:
```python
ratings_after.append(b)
```
This code appends the value of `b` to the end of the `ratings_after` list.

Initially, `ratings_before` has three instances of `a`, so `ratings_before` = `[a, a, a]`. 
Initially, `ratings_after` has two instances of `b`, so `ratings_after` = `[b, b]`.

After executing the code, `ratings_after` will have three instances of `b`, so `ratings_after` = `[b, b, b]`.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not changed by this operation, and `ratings_before` remains unchanged as well.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` is a list containing three instances of `a`, and `ratings_after` is a list containing three instances of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` is `[a, a, a]`, `ratings_after` is `[b, b, b]`.**
