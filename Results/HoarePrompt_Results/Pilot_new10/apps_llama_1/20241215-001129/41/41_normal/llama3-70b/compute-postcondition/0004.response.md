The given code snippet assigns the input values to the variables `a` and `b`, which are a pair of integers. Since `n` must be greater than 0 and no operation is performed on it in the given code snippet, its value remains unchanged but is not directly affected by this code. The state of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` also remains unchanged as no operation is performed on them. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` and `b` are a pair of input integers**
