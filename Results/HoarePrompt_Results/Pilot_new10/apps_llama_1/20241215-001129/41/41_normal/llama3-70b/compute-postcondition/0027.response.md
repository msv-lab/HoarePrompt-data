The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the given code snippet, we can only consider the general effect of the `break` statement.

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The initial state remains the same for all variables, and the `break` statement only affects the control flow.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
