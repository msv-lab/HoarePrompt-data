Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, and `unrated` is `False` if there exists a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`. The current value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `ratings_after` at index `i`.**
