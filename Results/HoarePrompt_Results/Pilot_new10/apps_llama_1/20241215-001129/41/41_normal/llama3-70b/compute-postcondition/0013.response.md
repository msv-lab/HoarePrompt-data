The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the end of the list `ratings_before`. Initially, `ratings_before` is a list containing two instances of the original input integer `a`. 

So, after appending `a` to `ratings_before`, it will contain three instances of the original input integer `a`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` is a list containing three instances of the original input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the original input integer `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` is a list containing three instances of `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of `b`.**
