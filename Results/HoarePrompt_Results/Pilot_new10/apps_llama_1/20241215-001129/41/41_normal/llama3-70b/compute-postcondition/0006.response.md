The code appends the value of `b` to the `ratings_after` list. The previous values of `n`, `ratings_before`, and `a` are not affected. 

The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `ratings_before` is still a list containing the input integer `a`, and `a` and `b` are still input integers. 
However, `ratings_after` is no longer an empty list; it now contains the input integer `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`, `a` and `b` are input integers**
