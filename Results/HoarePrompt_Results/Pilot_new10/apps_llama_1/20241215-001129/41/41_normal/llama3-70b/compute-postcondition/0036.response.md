Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`. If there exists a `j` in range(1, n) such that `ratings_before[0] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[0] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `unrated` is `True`.***
