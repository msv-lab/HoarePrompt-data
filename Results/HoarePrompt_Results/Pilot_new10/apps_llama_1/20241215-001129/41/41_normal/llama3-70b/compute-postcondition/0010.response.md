The code appends the value of `b` to the `ratings_after` list. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and the initial state of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are not affected by this operation. 

The initial state of `ratings_after` was a list containing the input integer `b`. After appending `b` to `ratings_after`, it becomes a list containing two instances of the input integer `b`.

The value of `n` is still greater than 1, `a` and `b` are still input integers, and `ratings_before` is still a list containing two instances of the input integer `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `ratings_before` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `b`**
