The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. 

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
