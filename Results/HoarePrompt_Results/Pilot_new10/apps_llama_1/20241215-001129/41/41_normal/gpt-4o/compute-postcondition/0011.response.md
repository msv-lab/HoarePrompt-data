The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a` and `b` to be two new integer inputs, which are obtained from the user by splitting the input string into two parts and converting them to integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing [(a, b)], `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 1, `a` is the first new input integer, `b` is the second new input integer**
