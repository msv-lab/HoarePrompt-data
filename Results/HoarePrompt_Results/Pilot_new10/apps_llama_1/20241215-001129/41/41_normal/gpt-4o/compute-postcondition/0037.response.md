Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant. The current value of `is_rated` is `True`. If `is_rated` is `False`, then the state of `is_unrated` and the lists remains as it was before the if statement, but since `is_rated` is `True`, the state of `is_unrated` and the lists remains unchanged. The list of participants and `ratings` remain unchanged.**
