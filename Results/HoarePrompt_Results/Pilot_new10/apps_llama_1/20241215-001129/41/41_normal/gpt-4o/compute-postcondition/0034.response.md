Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 3. If `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`, then `is_unrated` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains as described in the precondition with no additional changes.***
