Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `False`, and the current value of `i` is 1. The current value of the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is less than the current value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`.**
