The code appends a new tuple `(a, b)` to the `ratings` list. The previous values of `n`, `is_unrated`, and loop counter `_` are not affected. The lengths of the list of participants and `ratings` are still `n` and the new length of `ratings` is the old length of `ratings` plus 1, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing [(a, b), (a, b)], `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 1, `a` is the first new input integer, `b` is the second new input integer**
