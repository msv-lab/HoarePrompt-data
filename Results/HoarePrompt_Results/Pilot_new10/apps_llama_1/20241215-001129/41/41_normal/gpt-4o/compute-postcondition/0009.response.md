Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing [(a, b)], `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 0, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True`. If `a` equals `b`, then the state of `is_rated` remains unchanged, which in this case is `False`.***
