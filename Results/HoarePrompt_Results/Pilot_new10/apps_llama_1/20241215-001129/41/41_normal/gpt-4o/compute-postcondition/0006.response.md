The provided Python code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the `ratings` list. 

The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code, an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). The list of participants is still of length `n`. 

The `ratings` list, initially empty, now contains one element, which is the tuple `(a, b)`. 

The values of `is_rated`, `is_unrated`, and the loop counter `_` remain unchanged.

The values of `a` and `b` also remain unchanged as the first and second input integers respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing [(a, b)], `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 0, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
