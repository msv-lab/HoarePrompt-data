The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `n`, `ratings`, `i`, and `is_unrated` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 3, `is_unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
