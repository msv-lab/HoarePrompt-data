Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem description. The problem states that the records can be consistent if the total number of stones in the second observation (y) is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first observation (x). This is because the jury members can either take stones away or move stones from one pile to another, but they cannot add stones.

The program correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of the stones in each observation, and prints "Yes" if the sum of the second observation is less than or equal to the sum of the first observation, and "No" otherwise. This logic is consistent with the problem description, and the program does not contain any errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results.

The key insight here is that the program does not need to check the individual pile sizes or try to reconstruct the sequence of operations that the jury members performed. It only needs to check the total number of stones in each observation, which is a much simpler and more efficient approach. As long as the total number of stones in the second observation is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first observation, it is possible for the jury members to have performed some sequence of operations to produce the second observation, and therefore the records can be consistent.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
