The code `y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string into an integer. This list of integers is assigned to the variable `y`.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `x` is a list of `n` integers. The code does not directly modify `n` or `x`, but it introduces a new list `y` containing integers read from the input. 

The number of integers read into `y` is not explicitly constrained by the given code to be equal to `n`, but based on the context, it seems that `y` is intended to hold a list of `n` integers `y_1, y_2,..., y_n`. However, without explicit constraints in the code, we can only infer that `y` will contain integers, but the exact count depends on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers, and `y` is a list of integers read from the input, with the count of integers in `y` dependent on the input provided.**
