Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the input from the file as described. It first reads an integer `n`, then `n` integers for the first sequence `x`, and another `n` integers for the second sequence `y`.

2. **Checking Conditions:** The program calculates the total number of stones in both sequences `x` and `y` and checks if the total number of stones in `y` is greater than the total number of stones in `x`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it prints "No", because according to the problem description, the jury members can either take stones or move stones between piles, but they cannot add new stones.

3. **Correct Output:** If `total_y` is not greater than `total_x`, the program prints "Yes". This is because the jury members can either take stones from the piles or move stones between them, so it's possible to transform the sequence `x` into `y` without adding new stones.

The program handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description:

- If the total number of stones in `y` is greater than the total number of stones in `x`, the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible for the jury members to add new stones.

- If the total number of stones in `y` is not greater than the total number of stones in `x`, the program correctly prints "Yes" because it's possible for the jury members to transform `x` into `y` by taking or moving stones.

Overall, the program is correct and follows the problem description. It correctly handles all the specified cases and provides the expected output for the given input.
