Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of integers read from the input, `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`, and the current value of `total_y` is greater than the current value of `total_x`**
