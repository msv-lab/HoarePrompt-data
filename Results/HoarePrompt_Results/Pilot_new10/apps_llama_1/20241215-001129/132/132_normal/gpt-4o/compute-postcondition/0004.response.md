The code calculates the sum of the integers in list `y` and assigns it to `total_y`. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is still a list of `n` integers, and `y` is still a list of integers read from the input. `total_x` remains the sum of the integers in `x`. 

The new variable `total_y` is assigned the sum of all integers in the list `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of integers read from the input, `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`**
