The code creates a new list `y` by mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces. The `input()` function accepts a line of input and `split()` splits it into a list of strings. The `map(int,...)` then converts each string into an integer.

The initial state of `n` is still valid as it is not affected by this code. The initial state of `x` is also still valid as it is not modified by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers**
