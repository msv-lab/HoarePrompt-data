You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all cases. It checks if the sum of stones in the two arrays is equal and if the sorted arrays are equal. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the records can be consistent.

For example, consider the input:

3
1 2 3
1 3 2

In this case, the sum of stones is equal (1+2+3 = 1+3+2 = 6) and the sorted arrays are equal ([1, 2, 3] = [1, 2, 3]), but the records can indeed be consistent because a jury member can move one stone from the second pile to the third pile and then move one stone from the third pile to the second pile, resulting in the second array.

However, this simple example shows the logic in the program is incorrect, as the comparison of sorted lists is not a valid method to determine if the records can be consistent. A correct approach would be to check if the difference between the sums of the two arrays is even and if for each pile, the absolute difference between the number of stones in the two arrays is even. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_diff = sum(x) - sum(y)
    if total_diff > 0:
        # jury members took stones
        for i in range(n):
            if x[i] < y[i]:
                print('No')
                return
    elif total_diff < 0:
        # jury members brought stones
        for i in range(n):
            if x[i] > y[i]:
                print('No')
                return
    else:
        # jury members moved stones
        moved_stones = 0
        for i in range(n):
            moved_stones += abs(x[i] - y[i])
        if moved_stones % 2!= 0:
            print('No')
            return
    print('Yes')
```

This implementation correctly checks if the records can be consistent based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input will contain an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), followed by two lists of n integers (0 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (sum(x) != sum(y)) :
        print('No')
    else :
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if (x == y) :
            print('Yes')
        else :
            print('No')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a sorted list of input integers, `y` is a sorted list of input integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, 'Yes' has been printed; otherwise, 'No' has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers. If the sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, then 'No' has been printed to the console. If the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, then `x` and `y` are sorted lists, and if `x` is equal to `y`, 'Yes' has been printed; otherwise, 'No' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer n and two lists of n integers as input, checks if their sums are equal, and if so, checks if the sorted lists are equal, printing 'Yes' if they are equivalent and 'No' otherwise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
