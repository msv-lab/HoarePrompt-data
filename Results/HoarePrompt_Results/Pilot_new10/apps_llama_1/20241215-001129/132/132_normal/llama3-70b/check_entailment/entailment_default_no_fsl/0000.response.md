Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the sum of the stones in the two lists is equal, but the stones have been redistributed in a way that cannot be achieved by the jury members taking or moving stones. 

The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the sorted lists are equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the redistribution of stones is valid. The program should instead check if it's possible to transform the first list into the second list by taking or moving stones one by one, without changing the total sum of stones.

For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
```
The program will output 'Yes' because the sums are equal and the sorted lists are equal. However, this is a valid case according to the problem description, because the jury members can simply take stones from the second and fourth piles.

But if the input is:
```
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```
The program will also output 'No' which is correct, because the jury members cannot move or take stones to convert the first array into the second array.

However, the code does not work correctly for all cases. A correct implementation would need to check if the redistribution of stones is valid by checking if the difference between the two lists can be achieved by taking or moving stones one by one.

In the given code, checking if the sorted lists are equal is not sufficient to guarantee that the redistribution is valid. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
