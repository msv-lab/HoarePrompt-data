The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a list of integers to the variable `x`, where the integers are input by the user, split by whitespace, and then converted to integers. 

This code does not affect the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of input integers**
