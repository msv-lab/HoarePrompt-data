Correctness: **True**.

The provided program checks if the total number of stones in the garden is reduced or remains the same after the jury members' actions. If the total number of stones in the second observation is more than the first, it prints 'No' because the jury members can only take or move stones, not add them. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' because the reduction or no change in the total number of stones is possible by the jury members' actions.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The key insight here is that the jury members can only reduce the total number of stones (by taking them away) or redistribute them among the piles (by moving stones from one pile to another). Therefore, if the total number of stones in the second observation is less than or equal to the first, it is possible that the jury members' actions could have resulted in this change, and thus the program correctly outputs 'Yes'. Conversely, if the total number of stones increases, the program correctly outputs 'No' because this is impossible given the constraints on the jury members' actions.

Given the program's logic and the problem's constraints, it seems to correctly handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The examples provided in the problem description also align with the program's output, further supporting the conclusion that the program is correct.
