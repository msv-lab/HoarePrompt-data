Correctness: **False**

The given Python program attempts to solve a problem where Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net. The goal is to find the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready by placing a heat source at the optimal location.

However, the provided program has several issues. One major issue is that the `func_1` function assumes that the heat source will be placed at the midpoint of two pieces of meat, which is not necessarily the optimal location. In fact, the optimal location may not be on the line segment connecting two pieces of meat.

Another issue is that the `func_1` function only checks the lines formed by pairs of pieces of meat, but it does not consider the possibility that the heat source may be placed at a location that is not on any of these lines.

To illustrate the incorrectness of the program, consider a scenario with three pieces of meat located at (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0.5, 1) with hardness values 1, 1, and 1, respectively. Suppose we want to grill two pieces of meat (K = 2). The optimal location for the heat source would be (0.5, 0.5), which is not on the line segment connecting any two pieces of meat. However, the `func_1` function would not consider this location, and therefore, the program would not find the optimal solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible locations for the heat source and may not find the optimal solution in all cases.
