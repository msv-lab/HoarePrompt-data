The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The initial state of `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, but the specific values in the list are not provided. However, we know that the list `times` can be sorted.

The states of the other variables are not affected by the code. Therefore, `x` is still -998, `y` is still -999, `K` is still an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `ans` is still the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.**
