To solve this, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the variables. The code is `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`. This means we are assigning the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, 1000, -999, 1000)`

Now, we execute the code:
- `times` is updated to be the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, because `x` is -998 and `y` is -1000.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `ans`, and `N`) do not change as a direct result of this code. `func_2` is not defined in the problem statement, so we assume its result depends on its parameters. Therefore, the exact value of `times` after the execution will depend on what `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)` returns.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`**
