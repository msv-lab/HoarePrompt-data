To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the code step by step.

The initial state is:
**`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is a sorted list equal to the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**

Now, let's consider the impact of the code on the program:
```
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```
In this line of code, `times` is updated to be the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. Since `x` is -1000 and `y` is -999, `times` becomes the result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`.

The states of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `ans`, and `N`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is `times[K - 1]` where `times` was previously the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)` but now `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, and `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**
