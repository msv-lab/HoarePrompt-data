The code snippet provided is `times.sort()`. Since `times` is already stated to be the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, sorting it again will not change its value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` is the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)**
