Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The main issue lies in the implementation of `func_2` and `func_3`. 

In `func_2`, the function is supposed to calculate the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready given the position of the heat source. However, the current implementation of `func_2` takes a single point `(x, y)` as input, but then iterates over all pieces of meat (defined in the global variable `meats`). This means that `func_2` is not actually calculating the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready given the position of the heat source, but rather it's calculating the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready if the heat source were placed at the coordinates of the current piece of meat.

Moreover, in `func_3`, the function is supposed to find the position of the heat source that minimizes the time it takes for at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready. However, the current implementation of `func_3` only checks integer positions for the heat source, which means it may miss the optimal position if it is not an integer. Additionally, `func_3` calls `func_2` with the same point `(x, y)` as both the point of the meat and the position of the heat source, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, `func_2` should take the position of the heat source `(X, Y)` and a piece of meat `(x, y, c)` as input and return the time it takes for that piece of meat to be ready given the position of the heat source. Then, `func_3` should iterate over all possible positions of the heat source (not just integer positions) and find the position that minimizes the time it takes for at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready.

One possible case where the program does not work correctly is when the optimal position of the heat source is a non-integer value. In this case, the program will not consider this position and may return a suboptimal solution. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 2
-1 0 3
0.5 0 2
```
The optimal position of the heat source is likely to be a non-integer value (e.g., `X = -0.2`), but the program will only consider integer positions and may return a suboptimal solution. 

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case, so its correctness is **False**.
