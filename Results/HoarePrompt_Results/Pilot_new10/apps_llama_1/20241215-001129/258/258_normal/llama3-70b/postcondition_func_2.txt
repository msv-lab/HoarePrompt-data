The function iterates over all integer pairs (x, y) in the range -1000 to 1000, applies an unspecified calculation func_2 to each pair, sorts the results, and then returns the minimum of the K-1th elements of these sorted results, where K's value and its relation to the unspecified total number of pieces of meat (N) are left undefined.
