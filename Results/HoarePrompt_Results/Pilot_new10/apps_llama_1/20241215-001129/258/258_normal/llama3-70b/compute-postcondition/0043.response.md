To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand what the loop does and how the variables change.

The loop iterates over all possible values of `x` and `y` in the range -1000 to 1000. For each pair of `x` and `y`, it calculates `times` using the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, sorts `times`, and updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and the `K-1`th element of the sorted `times`.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can see that `x` and `y` take on all possible values in their range, and `ans` is updated at each iteration.

After all iterations, `x` will be 1000 (the last value it takes in the loop), and `y` will also be 1000 (the last value it takes in the inner loop). The value of `ans` will be the minimum of the `K-1`th elements of all `times` calculated for each pair of `x` and `y`.

The original value of `x` and `y` (the values before the loop starts) are integers such that -1000 <= `x`, `y` <= 1000. However, after the loop finishes, these original values are no longer relevant, as `x` and `y` have taken on all possible values in their range.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `ans` is the minimum of the `K-1`th elements of `times` for all possible pairs of `x` and `y` in the range -1000 to 1000.**
