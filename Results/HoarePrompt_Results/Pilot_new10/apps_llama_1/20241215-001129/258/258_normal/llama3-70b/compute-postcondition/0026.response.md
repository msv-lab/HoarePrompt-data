To understand the impact of the code on the program, let's break down the given initial state and the operation performed by the code.

Initial State:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -998
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`

The code sorts the `times` list in ascending order.

Given the initial state, the sorting operation affects only the `times` list. The sorting does not change the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, or `ans`. It only rearranges the elements of `times` so that they are in ascending order.

Therefore, after executing the code:

- `x` remains -999
- `y` remains -998
- `K` remains an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` remains the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, but since `times` is now sorted, `times[K - 1]` will be the `(K-1)`th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.
- `times` is now sorted in ascending order, being the result of sorting the output of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the `(K-1)`th smallest element in the sorted `times`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`**
