According to the code, the loop will execute regardless of the values of `y`, `K`, and `N`, as long as `x` is in the range from -1000 to 1000. The initial value of `x` is not specified, but since the loop iterates over a range, `x` will take on the value of the first element in the range, which is -1000.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is an integer such that -1000 <= `y` <= 1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `ans` is positive infinity**
