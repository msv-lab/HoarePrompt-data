According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. Since the loop iterates over a range from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive), the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to reflect that `y` is about to take on the value of the first iteration, which is -1000.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, 1000, -999, 1000)`**
