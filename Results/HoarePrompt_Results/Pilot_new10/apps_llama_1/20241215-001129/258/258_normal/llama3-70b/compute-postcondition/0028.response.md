To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is -999
   - `y` is 1000
   - `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
   - `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of `times` for all iterations
   - `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```
   for y in range(-1000, 1001):
       times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
       times.sort()
       ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
   ```

3. **Output States after Executing Some Number of Times**:
   - After 1 time: `y` is -1000, `ans` is updated with the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.
   - After 2 times: `y` is -999, `ans` is further updated.
   - After 3 times: `y` is -998, `ans` is updated again.

Given the loop iterates over `y` from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive), after all iterations:
- `y` will be 1000, as it takes the last value in the range after the loop finishes.
- `x` remains -999, as it does not change within the loop.
- `K` remains an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, as there's no operation modifying `K` within the loop.
- `ans` will be the minimum of the K-1th elements of `times` for all iterations. Since `times` is recalculated for each `y` and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the K-1th element of the new `times`, `ans` will hold the minimum K-1th value across all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range.
- `times` will be the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, as `y` takes the value 1000 in the last iteration.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is 1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range [-1000, 1000]
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`**
