According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1. 

The `times` and `func_2` do not impact the loop's execution, only the loop variable `y` does. The same applies to `x`, `K`, `ans`, and `N`, which are not related to the loop condition.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
