To analyze the functionality of the given function `func_3`, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Annotated Code**: The function iterates over all possible pairs of integers `x` and `y` in the range -1000 to 1000. For each pair, it calls a function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` (which is not defined in the provided snippet), sorts the result `times`, and then updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and the `K-1`th element of `times`.

2. **Return Postconditions**: The function is supposed to return the minimum of the `K-1`th elements of `times` for all possible pairs of `x` and `y` in the range -1000 to 1000.

However, upon closer inspection, there are several potential issues and inconsistencies between the annotations and the actual code:

- The annotations imply that `x` and `y` should be specific integer values such that `-1000 <= x, y <= 1000`, and `K` should be an integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, where `N` is not defined in the snippet. But the loop iterates over all possible pairs of `x` and `y` in the given range, not just specific values.

- The function uses `K` without defining it within the function or as a global variable that is visible in this context. The value of `K` and its relation to `N` (the total number of pieces of meat, as mentioned in the annotation) are critical for understanding the function's behavior but are left undefined.

- The function calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, but `func_2` is not defined in the provided snippet. This makes it impossible to know what `times` actually represents or how it's calculated, which is crucial for understanding the function's behavior.

- The annotation talks about `x` being 1000 and `y` being 1000 after the loop, which is true but does not reflect the function's purpose or behavior across all iterations.

Given these observations, the actual functionality of the function seems to be attempting to find a minimum value across a specific calculation (`func_2`) applied to all possible pairs of `x` and `y` within a defined range, considering a parameter `K` that seems to be externally defined. However, due to the missing definition of `func_2`, the unclear nature of `K` and `N`, and the discrepancy between the annotations and the code's behavior, the precise functionality is difficult to determine without further context.

The closest we can get to describing the functionality, based on the code provided and acknowledging the potential issues, is:

Functionality: ** The function iterates over all integer pairs (x, y) in the range -1000 to 1000, applies an unspecified calculation func_2 to each pair, sorts the results, and then returns the minimum of the K-1th elements of these sorted results, where K's value and its relation to the unspecified total number of pieces of meat (N) are left undefined. **
