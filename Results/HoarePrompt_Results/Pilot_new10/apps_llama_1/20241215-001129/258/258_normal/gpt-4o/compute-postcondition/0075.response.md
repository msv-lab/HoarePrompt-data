The given code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the third tuple in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`**
