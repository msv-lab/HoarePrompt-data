To compute the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the program. The code calculates the value of `my` based on previously defined variables. The formula used is:

`my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`

Given that `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, we substitute these into the formula for `my`. However, since `d2` and `d` are defined in terms of the elements of `meats` and other constants, and their exact numerical values aren't provided, we leave `my` in its calculated form based on these variables.

The states of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `cx`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` are not affected by this calculation since they are used to calculate `my` and do not depend on it.

Therefore, considering all variables and their dependencies, the output state after executing the given code is:
`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `cx` is `(meats[3] + meats[5]) / 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th or 3rd element of `meats` based on the comparison, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd or 5th element of `meats` based on the comparison, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

Output State: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `cx` is `(meats[3] + meats[5]) / 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th or 3rd element of `meats` based on the comparison, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd or 5th element of `meats` based on the comparison, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
