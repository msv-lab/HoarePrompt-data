The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are directly inside a loop, we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
