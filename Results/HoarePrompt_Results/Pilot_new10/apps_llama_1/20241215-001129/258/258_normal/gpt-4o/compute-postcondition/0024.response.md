To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `N` is an integer value extracted from `data[0]`.
   - `K` is an integer value extracted from `data[1]`.
   - `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, where each tuple is constructed from `data` at specific indices.
   - `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces.
   - `index` is calculated as `2 + 3N`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code calls a function `func_2` with parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, and assigns the return value to `result`.
   - The function `func_2` is not defined in the provided context, so we can't determine its exact behavior or how it modifies the input parameters or return value.

3. **Output State Determination**:
   - Since `func_2` is not defined, we assume it does not modify `N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, or `index` directly within the scope of the provided initial state but returns a value based on these inputs.
   - A new variable `result` is introduced, which is assigned the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`.
   - Without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot specify the exact value of `result`, only that it is the return value of `func_2` given `N`, `K`, and `meats` as inputs.

Therefore, considering the information provided and the format required for the answer:

Output State: **`N` is `int(data[0])`, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples constructed from `data`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is `2 + 3N`, and `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`.**
