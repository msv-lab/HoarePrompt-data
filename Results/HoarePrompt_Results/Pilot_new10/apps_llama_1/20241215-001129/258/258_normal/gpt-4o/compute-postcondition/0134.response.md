The code calculates the value of `my` based on the existing values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. 

`my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `my` is dependent on the conditional values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and `d` since `cy` and `dx` are dependent on `y1`, `y2`, `x1`, and `x2`, and `d2` is dependent on `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cx` is `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and the conditional values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d` remain dependent on conditions related to `d`; if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, the program ends the if-else block without any changes.**
