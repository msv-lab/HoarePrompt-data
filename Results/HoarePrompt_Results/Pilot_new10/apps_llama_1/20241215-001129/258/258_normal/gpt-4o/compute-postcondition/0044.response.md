To calculate the output state after executing the given Python code, we first need to understand what the code does. The code calculates the value of `my` using the previously computed values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. The formula to calculate `my` is:

`my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`

Given the initial state:

- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is greater than 2
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 2
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of `meats[j]`
- `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of `meats[0]`
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`

The calculation of `my` only affects the variable `my`, introducing it into the state. The formula for `my` depends on `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`, but since `d` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we'll keep `my` in terms of these variables. 

The output state, considering the introduction of `my`, is:

`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, 
`K` is a positive integer, 
`T` is a non-negative real number, 
`N` is greater than 2, 
`i` is 0, 
`j` is 2, 
`x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of `meats[j]`, 
`x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of `meats[0]`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, 
`mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, 
`my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of `meats[j]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of `meats[0]`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
