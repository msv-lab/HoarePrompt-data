You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given Python program attempts to solve a problem where Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net. The goal is to find the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready by placing a heat source at the optimal location.

However, the provided program has several issues. One major issue is that the `func_1` function assumes that the heat source will be placed at the midpoint of two pieces of meat, which is not necessarily the optimal location. In fact, the optimal location may not be on the line segment connecting two pieces of meat.

Another issue is that the `func_1` function only checks the lines formed by pairs of pieces of meat, but it does not consider the possibility that the heat source may be placed at a location that is not on any of these lines.

To illustrate the incorrectness of the program, consider a scenario with three pieces of meat located at (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0.5, 1) with hardness values 1, 1, and 1, respectively. Suppose we want to grill two pieces of meat (K = 2). The optimal location for the heat source would be (0.5, 0.5), which is not on the line segment connecting any two pieces of meat. However, the `func_1` function would not consider this location, and therefore, the program would not find the optimal solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible locations for the heat source and may not find the optimal solution in all cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of meat pieces with their coordinates and hardness, a minimum number of pieces to be ready, and a time within which the pieces should be ready. It calculates and checks conditions based on the meat pieces' hardness and distance to certain calculated points, returning True if the condition where the count of pieces meeting a specific distance and time criteria is greater than or equal to the minimum required is met, and False otherwise. The function modifies the input list by swapping elements based on their hardness relative to time, does not handle edge cases like an empty input list explicitly, and implicitly assumes positive K and non-negative T for its logic to apply as described. 

Output hint for function_2: The function performs a binary search with a precision of 1e-07 to find a threshold related to the readiness of meat pieces based on their hardness and a minimum readiness requirement, returning this threshold value. The precise condition for readiness is determined by another function, `func_1`, which is not defined in the provided code. 

Output hint for function_3: The function reads input from the user, parses it into the number of pieces of meat `N`, the number of pieces to be eaten `K`, and a list of meat pieces, calls `func_2` with these parameters, and prints the result with six decimal places, without validating if `K` exceeds `N` or if the input values are within the given constraints 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
