To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a non-negative real number.
- `N` is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`.
- `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`.

The given code is:
```python
cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
```

This code introduces a new variable `cx` and assigns it the average of `x1` and `x2`. 

Given that `x1` and `x2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, but without explicit values or conditions for `x1` and `x2` in the initial state, we can only express `cx` as the average of `x1` and `x2`.

The values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and `d` are not changed by the code. The only change is the introduction of `cx` with the value `(x1 + x2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, and `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.**
