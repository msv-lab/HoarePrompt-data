To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from the second tuple in `meats`
- `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from the third tuple in `meats`
- `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)` and `d` is greater than or equal to 0
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2 + (y1 - y2) / 2 * math.sqrt(((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)) * ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2) - ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2) * ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)) / (((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2))`

The given code snippet is:
```python
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

This code calculates the value of `my` based on the existing values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`.

The new value of `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

The output state includes all the initial state variables and their values, with the updated value of `my`:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from the second tuple in `meats`
- `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from the third tuple in `meats`
- `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)` and `d` is greater than or equal to 0
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2 + (y1 - y2) / 2 * math.sqrt(((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)) * ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2) - ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2) * ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)) / (((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2))`
- `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`
