The code increments `index` by 3. The previous value of `index` is 2, so the new value of `index` is 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is `int(data[0])` and is greater than 0, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is 5, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `y` is `int(data[3])`, and `c` is `int(data[4])`**
