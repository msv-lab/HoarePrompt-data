Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

One of the main issues with the code is that it does not correctly find the optimal position for the heat source. In `func_1`, it checks all pairs of meat pieces and calculates a point that is equidistant from the two pieces, taking into account their hardness. However, this approach does not guarantee that the optimal position is found.

Another issue with the code is that it assumes that the heat source can only be placed at certain discrete points, which is not the case. The problem description states that the coordinates of the heat source can be any real number.

Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple optimal positions for the heat source. In such cases, the code should return the minimum time required to cook the meat at any of these positions.

The code also lacks input validation. For example, it does not check if `K` is less than or equal to `N`, or if the input values are within the given constraints.

The binary search approach used in `func_2` is also problematic. The search range is initialized to `[0, 1000000000.0]`, which is not necessarily the correct range for all inputs. The search range should be based on the actual times required to cook the meat at different positions.

In the provided sample input, the program seems to work correctly, but this is not the case for all possible inputs. For example, if the input is `4 3`, `0 0 1`, `1 1 1`, `2 2 1`, `3 3 1`, the program will not correctly find the optimal position for the heat source.

Therefore, due to these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
