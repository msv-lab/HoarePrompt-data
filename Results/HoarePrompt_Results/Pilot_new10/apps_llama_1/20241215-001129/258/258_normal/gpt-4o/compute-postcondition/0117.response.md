According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`, so `N` must be greater than 4.

State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
