Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cx` is `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True, otherwise, there is no effect on the variables.**
