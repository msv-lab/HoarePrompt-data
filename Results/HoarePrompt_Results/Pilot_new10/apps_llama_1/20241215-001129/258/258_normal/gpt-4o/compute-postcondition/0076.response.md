Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the third tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `x1`, `y1`, `c1` being the values of the second tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` being the values of the third tuple in `meats`.***
