The `continue` statement does not modify any variables. It skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th element of `meats`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd element of `meats`. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` remain the values of the 3rd element of `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain the values of the 5th element of `meats`, and `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop**
