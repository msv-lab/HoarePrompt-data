Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the third tuple in `meats`. The current value of `c1` and `c2` are such that `c1` times `T` is less than `c2` times `T`.**
