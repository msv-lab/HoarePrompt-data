The value of `cy` is updated to be the average of `y1` and `y2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cx` is `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` depend on the conditions related to `d` as initially stated.
