Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)) / 4`, if `d * d2` is less than or equal to `d2`, the program ends the current iteration, otherwise, it continues to the next iteration of the loop***
