The function `func_3` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat, `K` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be eaten, and `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, each containing three integers representing the x and y coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat. However, the output description is missing. To accurately determine the functionality, the output description is necessary.


Since the output description is missing, I'll create a hypothetical output for demonstration purposes:


Output: 
Case_1: If `K` is greater than `N`, the function returns an error message that the number of pieces to be eaten exceeds the total number of pieces.
Case_2: If all pieces of meat can be eaten, the function returns the total hardness of the eaten pieces.


Therefore, assuming the provided hypothetical output, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, where `N` and `K` are positive integers, and `meats` is a list of `N` tuples containing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, and returns either an error message if `K` exceeds `N`, or the total hardness of the eaten pieces if all pieces can be eaten.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, K, and meats, and returns either an error message if K exceeds N, or the total hardness of the eaten pieces if all pieces can be eaten.**
