`N` remains `int(data[0])`, `K` remains `int(data[1])`, `meats` remains an empty list `[]`, and `data` remains a list of input strings split by spaces.
Output State: **`N` is `int(data[0])`, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list `[]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, and `index` is 2**
