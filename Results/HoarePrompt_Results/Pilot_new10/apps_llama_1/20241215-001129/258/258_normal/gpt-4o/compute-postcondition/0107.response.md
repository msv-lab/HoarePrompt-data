To find the output state, we'll analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`
- `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`

The code snippet is:
```python
dx = (x1 - x2) / 2
```

This code introduces a new variable `dx` and assigns it the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. This operation does not modify any of the existing variables but adds a new one.

Given the information, the output state reflects the introduction of `dx` without altering the existing variables. Therefore, all initial conditions remain valid except for the addition of `dx`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`**
