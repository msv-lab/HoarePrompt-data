Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, if `(c1 - c2) * T` is less than 0, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the execution continues with the current values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `i`, `j`, and `d`.***
