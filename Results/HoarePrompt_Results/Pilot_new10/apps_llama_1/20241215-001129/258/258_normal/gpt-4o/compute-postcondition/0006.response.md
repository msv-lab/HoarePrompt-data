The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `index` is 2. The value of `data[index]` is `data[2]`, which is a string that can be converted to an integer because it is part of the input strings split by spaces. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list `[]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces where `data[0]` can be converted to an integer greater than 0, `index` is 2, `x` is `int(data[2])`.

Output State: **`N` is `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list `[]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces where `data[0]` can be converted to an integer greater than 0, `index` is 2, `x` is `int(data[2])`**
