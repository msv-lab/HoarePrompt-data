The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and start a new iteration. In this case, we continue to the next iteration of the loop because `d` is less than 0. 

Given that we were already inside a situation where `d` is less than 0, this step does not alter any variable values directly. However, we proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th element of `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd element of `meats`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` remain the values of the 3rd element of `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain the values of the 5th element of `meats`, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` may be recalculated, `my` may be recalculated, `count` may change, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop because `d` is less than 0.**
