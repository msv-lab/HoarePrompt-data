The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are already inside a loop, the `continue` statement will cause the loop to move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration.

Output State: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` and `T` retain their initial values, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the current value of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the old values of the 4th element of `meats`, the current value of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the old values of the 3rd element of `meats`, otherwise the current value of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 3rd element of `meats`, the current value of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 4th element of `meats`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count` hold values based on the previous iteration of the loop or remain unchanged, `c1 * T < c2 * T` since `d` is less than 0, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
