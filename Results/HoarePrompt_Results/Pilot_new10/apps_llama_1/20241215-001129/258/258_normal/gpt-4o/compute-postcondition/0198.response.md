`dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `cx` is `(meats[3] + meats[5]) / 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th or 3rd element of `meats` based on the comparison, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd or 5th element of `meats` based on the comparison, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
