Postcondition: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` and `T` retain their initial values, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the old values of the 4th element of `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the old values of the 3rd element of `meats`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx`, `my`, `count` hold values based on the previous iteration of the loop or remain unchanged, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and if the product of `d` and `d2` is greater than `d2`, we move on to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the execution ends without further modifications.**
