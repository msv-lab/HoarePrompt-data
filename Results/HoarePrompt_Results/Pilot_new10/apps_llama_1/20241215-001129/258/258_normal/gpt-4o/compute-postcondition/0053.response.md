`d` is assigned the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Since `c1 * T - c2 * T` equals `(c1 - c2) * T` and `T` is a non-negative real number, the value of `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` equal the old values of `meats[3]` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` equal the old values of `meats[0]`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain as initially defined, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`**
