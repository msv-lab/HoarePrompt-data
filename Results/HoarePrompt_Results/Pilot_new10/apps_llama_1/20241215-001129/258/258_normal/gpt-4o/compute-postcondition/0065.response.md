To calculate the output state, we'll follow the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides various variable definitions and conditions:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a non-negative real number.
- `N` is greater than 3.
- Conditions and variable definitions: `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `i`, `j`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and the relationship between `d`, `d2`, `c1`, and `c2`.

The given code snippet assigns a value to `my`:
```python
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

This calculation does not change the values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `i`, `j`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, or `mx`. It only introduces a new variable `my` based on existing variables.

Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and variable definitions, plus the new definition for `my`:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a non-negative real number.
- `N` is greater than 3.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0.
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`.
- `mx` is `cx + dy * sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- The condition `d * d2` is less than or equal to `d2` or the program continues to the next iteration of the loop with `d` divided by `c1 * c2`.
- `my` is `cy - dx * sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
