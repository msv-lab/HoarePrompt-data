The code `c = int(data[index + 2])` assigns the value of `int(data[index + 2])` to `c`. The previous value of `c` was not explicitly set but would have been `int(data[7])` based on the initial pattern. However, this pattern is overridden by the new assignment.

Given the initial state, `index` is at least 9, so `index + 2` is at least 11. This means `c` will be assigned the value of the integer conversion of the string at index 11 in the `data` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 1, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is at least 9, `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is at least 9, `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`.**
