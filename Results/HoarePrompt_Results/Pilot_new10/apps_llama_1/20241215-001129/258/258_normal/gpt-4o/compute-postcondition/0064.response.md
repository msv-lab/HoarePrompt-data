The given code calculates a new value `mx` based on existing variables `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`. The other variables are not affected.

Since `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`, `d2` is positive. 

`mx` becomes `cx + dy * sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` which can also be written as `cx + dy * sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.

Given the information from the initial state: 

* `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat
* `K` is a positive integer
* `T` is a non-negative real number
* `N` is greater than 3
* `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`
* `i` is 0
* `j` is 3
* `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0
* `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
* `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
* `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
* `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
* `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`
* If `d * d2` is less than or equal to `d2`, the program ends this iteration. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop with `d` divided by `c1 * c2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.
