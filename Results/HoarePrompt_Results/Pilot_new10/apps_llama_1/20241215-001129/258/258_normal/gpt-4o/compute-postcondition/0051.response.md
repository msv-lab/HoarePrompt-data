The given code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2` and vice versa. The new values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are equal to the old values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and the new values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are equal to the old values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` equal the old values of `meats[3]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` equal the old values of `meats[0]`, and other variables (`cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`) remain as initially defined based on the old `meats[3]`.**
