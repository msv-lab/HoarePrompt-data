To calculate the output state, we first look at the initial state and then apply the given code to it. 

In the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a non-negative real number.
- `N` is at least 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- `x1` is `meats[1][0]`.
- `y1` is `meats[1][1]`.
- `c1` is `meats[1][2]`.
- `x2` is `meats[4][0]`.
- `y2` is `meats[4][1]`.
- `c2` is `meats[4][2]`.
- `d` is `T / meats[4][2] - T / meats[1][2]`.
- `cx` is `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`.
- `cy` is `(meats[1][1] + meats[4][1]) / 2`.
- `dx` is `(meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) / 2`.
- `dy` is `(meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) / 2`.
- `d2` is `((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4`.
- `mx` is `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2 + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) / 2 * math.sqrt(((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4 * (T / meats[4][2] - T / meats[1][2]) - (T / meats[4][2] - T / meats[1][2]) * (T / meats[4][2] - T / meats[1][2])) / (((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4)`.

Then, the code `x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2 = x2, y2, c2, x1, y1, c1` is applied, which swaps the values of `x1` with `x2`, `y1` with `y2`, and `c1` with `c2`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `meats` is still a list of tuples.
- `K` is still a positive integer.
- `T` is still a non-negative real number.
- `N` is still at least 4.
- `i` is still 1.
- `j` is still 4.
- `x1` is now `meats[4][0]`.
- `y1` is now `meats[4][1]`.
- `c1` is now `meats[4][2]`.
- `x2` is now `meats[1][0]`.
- `y2` is now `meats[1][1]`.
- `c2` is now `meats[1][2]`.
- `d` is still `T / meats[4][2] - T / meats[1][2]`.
- `cx` is still `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`.
- `cy` is still `(meats[1][1] + meats[4][1]) / 2`.
- `dx` is still `(meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) / 2`.
- `dy` is still `(meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) / 2`.
- `d2` is still `((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4`.
- `mx` is still `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2 + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) / 2 * math.sqrt(((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4 * (T / meats[4][2] - T / meats[1][2]) - (T / meats[4][2] - T / meats[1][2]) * (T / meats[4][2] - T / meats[1][2])) / (((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4)`.

But, since the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` have been swapped, we must update `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` accordingly.

- `d` becomes `T / meats[1][2] - T / meats[4][2]`.
- `cx` remains `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`.
- `cy` remains `(meats[1][1] + meats[4][1]) / 2`.
- `dx` becomes `(meats[4][0] - meats[1][0]) / 2`.
- `dy` becomes `(meats[4][1] - meats[1][1]) / 2`.
- `d2` remains `((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4`.
- `mx` becomes `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2 + (meats[4][1] - meats[1][1]) / 2 * math.sqrt(((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4 * (T / meats[1][2] - T / meats[4][2]) - (T / meats[1][2] - T / meats[4][2]) * (T / meats[1][2] - T / meats[4][2])) / (((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4)`.

Therefore, the output state is:

`mx` is `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2 + (meats[4][1] - meats[1][1]) / 2 * math.sqrt(((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4 * (T / meats[1][2] - T / meats[4][2]) - (T / meats[1][2] - T / meats[4][2]) * (T / meats[1][2] - T / meats[4][2])) / (((meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) * (meats[1][0] - meats[4][0]) + (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1]) * (meats[1][1] - meats[4][1])) / 4)`.
