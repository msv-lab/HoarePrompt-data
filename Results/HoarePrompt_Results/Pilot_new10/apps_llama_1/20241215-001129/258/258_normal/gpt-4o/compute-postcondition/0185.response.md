Postcondition: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are either the values of the 5th or 3rd element of `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are either the values of the 3rd or 5th element of `meats`, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2 + (y1 - y2) / 2 * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, if the sum of `c` for all `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where `math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than or equal to `d` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns True, otherwise no action is taken.**
