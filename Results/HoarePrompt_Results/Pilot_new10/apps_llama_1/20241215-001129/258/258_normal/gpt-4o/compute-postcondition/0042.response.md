Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of `meats[j]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of `meats[0]`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, if `d * d2` is less than or equal to `d2`, no changes are made, otherwise the loop proceeds to the next iteration**
