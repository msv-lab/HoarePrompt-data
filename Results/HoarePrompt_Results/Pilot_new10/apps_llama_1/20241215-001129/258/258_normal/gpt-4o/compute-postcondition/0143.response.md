Postcondition: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` and `T` retain their initial values, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 3rd element of `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 4th element of `meats`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count` hold values based on the previous iteration of the loop or remain unchanged. The current value of `c1` is such that its product with `T` is less than the product of `c2` and `T`, meaning `c1 * T < c2 * T`.**
