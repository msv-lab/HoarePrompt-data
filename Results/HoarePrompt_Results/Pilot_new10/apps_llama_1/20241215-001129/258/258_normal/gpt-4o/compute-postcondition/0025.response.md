The code `print(f'{result:.6f}')` prints the value of `result` with six decimal places. It does not change the value of `result` or any other variable. 

Output State: **`N` is `int(data[0])`, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples constructed from `data`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is `2 + 3N`, and `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`, the value of `result` has been printed to six decimal places.**
