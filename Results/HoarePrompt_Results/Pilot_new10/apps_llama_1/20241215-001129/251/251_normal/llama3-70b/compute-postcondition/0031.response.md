Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `dp` is a list where initially `dp[i]` equals `cakes[n][0]`, and `j` is 0. The current value of `dp[i]` is `cakes[n][0]`. The current value of `j` is 0. `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`.**
