Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cakes` is a list of at least 2 tuples representing cakes sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of at least 2 floats where the initial value of `dp[0]` equals the volume of the first cake (`cakes[0][0]`) and the initial value of `dp[1]` equals the volume of the second cake (`cakes[1][0]`), `j` is 0. The current values of `i` and `j` are such that the sugar content of the cake at index `i` (`cakes[i][1]`) is less than the sugar content of the cake at index `j` (`cakes[j][1]`), and the calorie content of the cake at index `i` (`cakes[i][2]`) is less than the calorie content of the cake at index `j` (`cakes[j][2]`)**
