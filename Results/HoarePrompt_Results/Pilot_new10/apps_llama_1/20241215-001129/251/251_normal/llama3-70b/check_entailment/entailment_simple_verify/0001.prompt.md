You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(dp[-1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The condition for stacking cakes is incorrect. According to the problem description, cake i can be placed on top of cake j only if the volume of cake i is strictly greater than the volume of cake j. However, in the given code, the condition checks if the radius and height of cake i are both less than the radius and height of cake j, which is not equivalent to the volume condition.

The correct condition should be `cakes[i][0] > cakes[j][0]` instead of `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. 

Additionally, the sorting of cakes in descending order of their volumes is not necessary and may even lead to incorrect results. The dynamic programming approach should consider all possible ways of stacking cakes, not just the ones where the cake with the largest volume is placed first.

To fix the program, we need to modify the condition for stacking cakes and remove the sorting of cakes. We also need to initialize the dp array with the volumes of the cakes, not zeros. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    dp = [cake[0] for cake in cakes]
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][0] > cakes[j][0]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(max(dp))
```

This corrected version of the program correctly implements the problem description and should work for all test cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of pairs of positive integers, where each pair represents the radius and height of a cake, and the total number of cakes, also a positive integer, is provided as input.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains the volume, radius, and height of a cake, calculated as `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)` for each input pair `(r, h)`.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.
    #
    #1. **Initial Conditions**: 
    #   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
    #   - `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains the volume, radius, and height of a cake, calculated as `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`, sorted in descending order by volume.
    #   - `dp` is a list of `n` floats, where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and the rest of `dp` equals `0.0`.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```python
    #   for i in range(1, n):
    #       dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
    #       for j in range(i):
    #           if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
    #               dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    #   ```
    #
    #3. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n-1`.
    #   - For each `i`, it first sets `dp[i]` to `cakes[i][0]`.
    #   - Then, for each `j` less than `i`, it checks if the radius and height of the cake at index `i` are both less than those of the cake at index `j`. If so, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`.
    #
    #**Key Observations**:
    #- The loop does not update `n`.
    #- `i` iterates from `1` to `n-1`.
    #- `cakes` remains unchanged as a list of `n` tuples.
    #- `dp` is updated based on the comparisons made between elements of `cakes` at indices `i` and `j`.
    #
    #**Determining the Final State**:
    #- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
    #- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop, as it's the last value it takes during the iteration.
    #- `cakes` remains a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order by volume.
    #- For each `i`, `dp[i]` will be the maximum value considering all possible combinations where `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]` for any `j` less than `i`, added to `cakes[i][0]`, or its initial value `cakes[i][0]` if no such conditions are met.
    #
    #**Special Case: Loop Does Not Execute**:
    #- If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains an empty list (or a list with a single element `0.0` if `dp` was preinitialized with a size of `n`).
    #- If `n` is `1`, the loop also does not execute, and `dp` remains a list with a single element equal to `cakes[0][0]`.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples representing cakes sorted in descending order by volume, and for each `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `cakes[i][0]` and `dp[j]` for any `j` less than `i` where `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, or `dp` is a list with `n` elements where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and the rest are `0.0` if the loop does not execute.**
