You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(dp[-1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The issue lies in the condition where a cake can be placed on top of another: `if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:`. This condition checks if the radius and height of the current cake are both less than the radius and height of the cake it is being placed on. However, according to the problem description, a cake can be placed on top of another if its volume is strictly greater than the volume of the cake it is being placed on.

The correct condition should be `if cakes[i][0] > cakes[j][0]:`, which checks if the volume of the current cake is greater than the volume of the cake it is being placed on.

Additionally, the condition in the problem description also states that cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. The current implementation does not enforce this condition correctly, as it allows a cake to be placed on any previous cake, regardless of its index.

Here is an example where the program may not work correctly:

Input:
```
3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
In this case, the program may not correctly determine the maximum volume, as it does not correctly enforce the condition that a cake can only be placed on a previous cake if its volume is greater.

To fix the program, the correct condition should be used, and the cakes should be sorted by their volumes in descending order. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][0] > cakes[j][0]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(max(dp))
```
This corrected version of the program should work correctly for all cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of cake dimensions and the total number of cakes, calculates the volume of each cake, sorts the cakes in descending order by volume, and then calculates the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked, considering the condition that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if its radius and height are both less than those of the cake it is being stacked on, and prints this maximum volume, although it may not handle invalid inputs, such as non-positive integers for the number of cakes, non-positive integers for the radius and height of a cake, or cakes with the same radius and height. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
