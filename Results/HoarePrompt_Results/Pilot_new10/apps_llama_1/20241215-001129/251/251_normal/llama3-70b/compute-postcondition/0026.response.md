Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `cakes` is a list of at least 2 tuples representing cakes sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals `2 * cakes[1][0]` if `cakes[1][1]` < `cakes[0][1]` and `cakes[1][2]` < `cakes[0][2]`, otherwise `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[2][1]` < `cakes[0][1]` and `cakes[2][2]` < `cakes[0][2]`, then `dp[2]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `cakes[0][0] + cakes[2][0]`, `j` is 0**
