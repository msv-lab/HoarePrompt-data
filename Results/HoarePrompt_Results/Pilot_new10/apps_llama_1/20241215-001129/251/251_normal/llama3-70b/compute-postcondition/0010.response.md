The value of `cakes` is updated by appending a new tuple to the list. The new tuple contains the values `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing three tuples: the original two tuples `(math.pi * previous_r * previous_r * previous_h, previous_r, previous_h)` and the new tuple `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `_` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing three tuples: two tuples `(math.pi * previous_r * previous_r * previous_h, previous_r, previous_h)` and a new tuple `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `_` is 1**
