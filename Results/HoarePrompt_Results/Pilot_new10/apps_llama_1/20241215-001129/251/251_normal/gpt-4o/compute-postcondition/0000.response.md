The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `data`. 

The initial state is that `n` is a positive integer, and `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake.

The code does not modify the values of `n` and `cakes`. It introduces a new variable `data` which is a list of strings.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, `data` is a list of input strings**
