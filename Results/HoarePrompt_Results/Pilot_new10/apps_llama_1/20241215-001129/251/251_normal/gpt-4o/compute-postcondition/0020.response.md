Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, `j` is 0, and if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[i]` is `max(dp[i], dp[0] + volumes[i])`.**
