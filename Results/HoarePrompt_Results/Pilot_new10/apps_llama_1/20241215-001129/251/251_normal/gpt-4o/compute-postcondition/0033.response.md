Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n+1` positive floating-point numbers, `i` equals `n`, `j` equals 0. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp` is a list of `n+1` values where `dp[n]` equals `max(volumes[n], dp[0] + volumes[n])`.***
