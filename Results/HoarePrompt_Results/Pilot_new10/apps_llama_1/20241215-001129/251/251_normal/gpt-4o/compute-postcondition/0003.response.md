To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers extracted from `data` at indices `2*i + 1` and `2*i + 2` for `i` in range `n`.
   - `data` is a list of input strings.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code calls a function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `cakes`, and assigns the return value to the variable `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we can't determine its exact behavior or return value. However, we know that `result` will hold the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`.

Given the information provided and the fact that `func_1` is not defined, the output state will include the initial conditions for `n`, `cakes`, and `data`, with the addition of `result` being equal to the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers extracted from `data` at indices `2*i + 1` and `2*i + 2` for `i` in range `n`, `data` is a list of input strings, and `result` is returned by `func_1(n, cakes)`**
