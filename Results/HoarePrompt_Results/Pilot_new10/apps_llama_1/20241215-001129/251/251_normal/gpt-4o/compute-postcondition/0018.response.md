Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, `dp` is a list of `n` values, and the initial value of `j` is 0. The current value of `j` is 0 and the current value of `i` is at least 1. The volumes list has the property that the volume at index `j` (which is 0) is greater than the volume at index `i`.**
