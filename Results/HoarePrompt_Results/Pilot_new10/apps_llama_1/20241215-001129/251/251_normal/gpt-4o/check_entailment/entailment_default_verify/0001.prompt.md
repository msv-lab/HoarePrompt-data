You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. Here's why:

1. The program calculates the volume of each cake using the formula `π * r * r * h`, which is correct.
2. The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is correct. It iterates over each cake and checks if it can be placed on top of any previous cake. If it can, it updates the maximum volume that can be achieved up to that point.
3. The program handles the constraint that a cake can only be placed on top of a previous cake if its volume is strictly greater than the previous cake's volume.
4. The program also handles the constraint that a cake can only be placed on the table or on top of a previous cake with a smaller index.

I've reviewed the code and couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work correctly. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

The dynamic programming approach used in the program is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is acceptable for the given input constraints. The space complexity is O(n), which is also acceptable.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work correctly for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function calculates the maximum stackable volume of cakes given their dimensions, where each cake must be smaller in volume than the one it is stacked on, and returns this maximum volume. It handles cases where no cakes can be stacked and returns 0 if there are no cakes. However, it does not explicitly validate input for positive integers or handle cases where input dimensions are negative or lead to non-integer volumes. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts input from the user, processes it into a number `n` and a list of cake dimensions `cakes`, passes this data to `func_1` for calculation, and prints the result with six decimal places, without explicit input validation for positivity or integer constraints, and without showing the implementation of `func_1` which performs the actual calculation based on cake dimensions. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
