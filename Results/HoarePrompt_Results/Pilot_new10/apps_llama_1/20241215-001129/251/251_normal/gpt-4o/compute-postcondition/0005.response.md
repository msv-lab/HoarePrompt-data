The function `func_2` does not seem to accept any parameters, as the given function definition is `def func_2():`. However, according to the parameter constraints, the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. 

Assuming the function should be defined as `def func_2(n, cakes):`, we can proceed with the analysis.

The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. `n` is a positive integer, and `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake.

Since the output is not provided, I will assume a general output based on the input parameters. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `cakes` of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, and return a value based on the provided input.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list cakes of n tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, and returns a value based on the provided input.**
