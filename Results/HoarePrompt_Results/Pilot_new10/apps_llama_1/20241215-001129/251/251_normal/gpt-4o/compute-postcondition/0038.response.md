The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. Since `i` equals `n` and `j` equals 2, `dp[n]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[2] + volumes[n]`. The current value of `dp[n]` is `max(max(volumes[n], dp[0] + volumes[n]), dp[1] + volumes[n])` if `volumes[1]` is less than `volumes[n]` and `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, otherwise it is `max(volumes[n], dp[0] + volumes[n])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n+1` positive floating-point numbers, `i` equals `n`, `j` equals 2, if `volumes[1]` is less than `volumes[n]`, then if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, `dp[n]` equals `max(max(max(volumes[n], dp[0] + volumes[n]), dp[1] + volumes[n]), dp[2] + volumes[n])`, otherwise, `dp[n]` equals `max(max(volumes[n], dp[0] + volumes[n]), dp[2] + volumes[n])`**
