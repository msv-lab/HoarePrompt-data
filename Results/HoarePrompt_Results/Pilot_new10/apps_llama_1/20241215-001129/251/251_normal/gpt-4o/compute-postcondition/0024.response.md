According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, and `i` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again when `j` is 2 and `i` is 3, because the loop iterates over the range of `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 3, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, `j` is 2**
