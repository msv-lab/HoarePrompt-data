The value of `dp[i]` is updated to `volumes[i]`. Since `i` is `n`, `dp[n]` is assigned the value of `volumes[n]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n+1` positive floating-point numbers, `dp` is a list of `n+1` values where `dp[n]` is equal to `volumes[n]`, and `i` is `n`**
