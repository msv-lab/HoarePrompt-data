The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is 2, and the value of `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed, and now `x` and `y` have also been printed. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and `x` and `y` have been printed**
