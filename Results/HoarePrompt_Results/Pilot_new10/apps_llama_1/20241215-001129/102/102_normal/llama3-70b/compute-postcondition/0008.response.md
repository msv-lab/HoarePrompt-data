The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program. When `exit()` is called, the program stops executing and returns control to the operating system. The values of the variables do not change, but the program terminates.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is the integer part of `n` divided by `b`, `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, the string 'YES' has been printed, `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has terminated**
