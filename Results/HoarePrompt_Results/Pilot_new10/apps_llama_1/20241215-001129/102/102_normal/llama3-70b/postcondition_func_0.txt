The function reads the amount of money `n`, the cost of one Ber-Cola bottle `a`, and the cost of one Bars bar `b` from standard input, and attempts to find a combination of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`) and Bars bars (`y`) such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. If such a combination exists, it prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y`. If no combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to spend exactly `n` amount of money on the given items.
