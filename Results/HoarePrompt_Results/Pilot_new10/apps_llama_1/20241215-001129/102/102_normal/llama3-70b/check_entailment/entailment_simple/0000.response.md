Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to buy a certain amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars to spend exactly `n` burles.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It takes the inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` as specified in the problem description.
2. It iterates over all possible values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) from 0 to `n // a` (the maximum number of bottles of Ber-Cola that can be bought).
3. For each value of `x`, it calculates the corresponding value of `y` (the number of Bars bars) such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. This is done by calculating `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`.
4. If the calculated `y` satisfies the condition `x * a + y * b == n`, it prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y` and terminates the program.
5. If no combination of `x` and `y` is found such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, it prints "NO" after the loop completes.

The program is correct because it exhaustively searches all possible combinations of `x` and `y` within the given constraints. The condition `x * a + y * b == n` ensures that the program only prints "YES" when it finds a valid solution.

In terms of time complexity, the program has a time complexity of O(n/a), which is acceptable given the constraints on `n` and `a` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000 and 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000).

Overall, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
