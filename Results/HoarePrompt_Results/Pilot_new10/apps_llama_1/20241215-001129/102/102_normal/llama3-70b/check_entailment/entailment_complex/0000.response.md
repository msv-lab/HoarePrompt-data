Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Reading input**: The program reads three integers from standard input: `n` (the amount of money), `a` (the cost of one Ber-Cola bottle), and `b` (the cost of one Bars bar). This aligns with the problem description's input specification.

2. **Finding a combination**: The program attempts to find a combination of non-negative integers `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and `y` (number of Bars bars) such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

3. **Checking all possibilities**: The program checks all possible values of `x` from 0 to `n // a` (inclusive) and calculates the corresponding value of `y` using `(n - x * a) // b`. If it finds a combination where `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, it prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and exits.

4. **Handling no solution**: If the program doesn't find a combination that satisfies the equation after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to spend exactly `n` amount of money on the given items. This aligns with the problem description's output specification.

5. **Correctness of the loop**: The loop iterates over all possible values of `x` and calculates the corresponding `y`. Since `x` ranges from 0 to `n // a`, and for each `x`, `y` is calculated as `(n - x * a) // b`, the program effectively checks all possible combinations of `x` and `y` that could satisfy the equation.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description's requirements. Therefore, it will always produce the correct output for any valid input, making it a correct solution.

In more detail, the program's correctness can be argued as follows:

- The program checks all possible combinations of `x` and `y` by iterating over `x` from 0 to `n // a`. For each `x`, it calculates `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`, which ensures that `y` is an integer (since `n - x * a` is divisible by `b` if a solution exists).
- The program checks if the current combination of `x` and `y` satisfies the equation `x * a + y * b == n`. If it does, the program prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and exits.
- If the program doesn't find a solution after checking all combinations, it prints 'NO'.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, and it will always produce the expected output for any valid input.
