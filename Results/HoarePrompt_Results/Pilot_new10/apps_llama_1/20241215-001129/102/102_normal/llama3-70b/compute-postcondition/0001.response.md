The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value of an input integer to `a`. The initial state had `n` as an input integer and `a` and `b` to be obtained from standard input. After this operation, `a` is an input integer and `b` is still to be obtained from standard input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10 000 000), `a` is an input integer, `b` is still to be obtained from standard input as the cost of one Bars bar.**
