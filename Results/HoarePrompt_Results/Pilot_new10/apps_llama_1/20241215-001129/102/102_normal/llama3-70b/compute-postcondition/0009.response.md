Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is the integer part of `n` divided by `b`. If `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, then the string 'YES' has been printed, `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has terminated. Regardless of the condition, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `y` is determined as the integer part of `n` divided by `b`.**
