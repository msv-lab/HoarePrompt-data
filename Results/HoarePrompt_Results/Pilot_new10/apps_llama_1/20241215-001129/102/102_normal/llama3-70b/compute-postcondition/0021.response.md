Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`. If `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed, `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.**
