The value of `b` is assigned the value of an input integer using `int(input())`. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not affected. The initial state of `b` was waiting to be read from the input, so now it is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000**
