Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the solution to the problem. It attempts to find integer values x and y such that n = a*x + b*y by iterating over possible values of x (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) and checking if the remaining amount (n - x*a) can be divided evenly by b (the cost of a Bars bar). If such a combination exists, it prints "YES" along with the values of x and y; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The code handles all positive integers n, a, and b within the specified range (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000) and correctly handles edge cases such as when x or y is 0. It also correctly implements the equation x·a + y·b = n, where x and y are non-negative integers.

The provided examples in the problem description demonstrate the code's correctness. For instance, the code correctly outputs "YES" with x = 2 and y = 1 for the input n = 7, a = 2, and b = 3, since 2*2 + 1*3 = 7. It also correctly outputs "YES" with x = 0 and y = 10 for the input n = 100, a = 25, and b = 10, since 0*25 + 10*10 = 100. Additionally, it correctly outputs "NO" for the input n = 15, a = 4, and b = 8, since there are no integer values of x and y that satisfy the equation.

The code does not contain any logic that would cause it to behave unexpectedly for any valid input within the specified range, and it does not contain any syntax errors. Therefore, it can be concluded that the code is correct and works as expected for all potential cases within the specified problem constraints.
