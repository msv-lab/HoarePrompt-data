To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000.
   - `b` is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000.
   - `x` is initially 0.

2. **Given Condition**: The expression `n - x * a` is a multiple of `b`. Since `x` is 0, this simplifies to `n` being a multiple of `b`.

3. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

4. **Analysis**:
   - Since `x` is 0, the expression `n - x * a` simplifies to `n`.
   - Therefore, `y = n // b`.
   - Given that `n` is a multiple of `b` (since `x` is 0 and `n - x * a` is a multiple of `b`), `y` will be an integer representing how many times `b` fits into `n`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `n` is an input integer and a multiple of `b`.
   - `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000.
   - `b` is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is an integer equal to `n // b`, which is the quotient of `n` divided by `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer and a multiple of `b`, `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`**
