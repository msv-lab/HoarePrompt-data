The given code simply prints 'YES' to the console. This operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the states of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be at least `a`, `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
