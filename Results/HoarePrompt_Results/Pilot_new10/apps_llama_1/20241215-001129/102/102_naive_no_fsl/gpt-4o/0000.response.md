Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the given problem. It checks all possible combinations of buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars within the given budget `n`. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:
- It iterates over all possible numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`) that can be bought with `n` burles, which is `n // a + 1`.
- For each `x`, it checks if the remaining amount of money (`n - x * a`) is divisible by the cost of a Bars bar (`b`).
- If it finds a combination where the remaining amount is divisible by `b`, it calculates the number of Bars bars (`y`) that can be bought with the remaining amount and prints the result.
- If it doesn't find any such combination after checking all possible `x`, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `x` or `y` is 0, and when the total cost is exactly equal to `n`. The provided examples also demonstrate the program's correctness.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and correctly implements the problem description.
