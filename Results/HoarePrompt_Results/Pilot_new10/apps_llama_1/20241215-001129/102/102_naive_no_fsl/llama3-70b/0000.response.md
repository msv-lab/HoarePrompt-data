Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct and correctly implements the problem description. 

The program iterates over all possible non-negative numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola (x) that can be bought, calculates the corresponding number of Bars bars (y) that can be bought, and checks if the total cost (x * a + y * b) equals the total amount of money (n). If such a combination is found, it prints "YES" and the corresponding values of x and y. If no combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where x or y is 0, and it correctly checks all possible combinations of x and y.

The loop `for x in range(n // a + 1):` is sufficient because if x is greater than `n // a`, then `x * a` will be greater than `n`, which means that it's impossible to buy `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and spend exactly `n` burles.

The line `y = (n - x * a) // b` calculates the maximum number of Bars bars that can be bought with the remaining money, and the condition `if x * a + y * b == n:` checks if the total cost equals the total amount of money.

The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program as soon as a valid combination is found, which is efficient because it avoids unnecessary iterations.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly.
