To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

The loop condition is `while b:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is not zero (since in a boolean context, non-zero integers are considered True and zero is considered False).

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is the original value of `b`
- `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`
- `a` and `b` are integers

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must not be zero. Since `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, for `b` to be non-zero after the previous iteration, the original `a` must not have been exactly divisible by the original `b`. This implies that the remainder (which is the current value of `b`) must be greater than zero and less than the original `b` (since it's a remainder).

However, since we're only concerned with whether the loop can execute again (i.e., whether `b` is not zero), and given that `b` is the remainder of a division operation, the critical condition is that `b` must be non-zero for the loop to continue. The given state already specifies that `b` is the remainder of a division, which inherently means it's an integer and could potentially be non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `b` is not zero for the loop to execute again. Since `a` is now the original value of `b` and `b` is the remainder of the original division, for the loop to continue, we simply need to ensure that the remainder (current `b`) is not zero. The information about `a` and `b` being integers is maintained, but the critical adjustment is ensuring `b` is not zero.

State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is a non-zero remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, and `a` and `b` are integers**
