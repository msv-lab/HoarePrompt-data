To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given code and the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
while b:
    a, b = b, a % b
```
This is a Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe that:

- `a` is updated to the original value of `b` in the first iteration.
- `b` is updated to the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b` in the first iteration.
- The loop continues to update `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0.

The final output state can be determined by understanding that the loop will continue to execute until `b` becomes 0. At this point, `a` will hold the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `b` is 0, and `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`**
