The code `a = i * x` assigns the product of `i` and `x` to the variable `a`. Given that `i` is 1 and `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, the value of `a` is equal to `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y / x` and is at least 1, the current value of `z` is a multiple of `i`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, and `a` is equal to `x`.**
