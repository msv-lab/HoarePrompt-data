Postcondition: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z = y / x` and is at least 1, `z` is a multiple of `i`, `i` is 1, the current value of `a` equals `x`, and the current value of `b` equals `y`. Additionally, `l` is less than or equal to `a` and `a` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is less than or equal to `b` and `b` is less than or equal to `r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` equals `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor equals `y`. If `a` equals `b`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 2.**
