Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z = y / x` and is at least 1, `i` is 1. If `z` is a multiple of `i`, `a` equals `x`, `b` equals `y`, and the conditions `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` equals `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor equals `y` are met, then `count` is 1 if `a` equals `b`, otherwise `count` is 2. If these conditions are not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
