The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` within the specified constraints. The function first checks if `y` is divisible by `x`. If `y` is not divisible by `x`, the function immediately returns 0. If `y` is divisible by `x`, the function calculates the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are within the range `[l, r]`, `a = i * x`, `b = z // i * x` (where `z = y // x`), `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`. Each pair contributes 1 to the count if `a == b` and 2 if `a!= b`. 

The function iterates through all possible values of `i` from 1 to the square root of `z` (inclusive) to find the pairs `(a, b)`. 

The functionality of the function includes handling edge cases such as when `l`, `r`, `x`, or `y` are at the boundaries of their specified constraints, as well as when `y` is exactly divisible by `x` but `z` has no divisors within the range `[l, r]`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` and returns 0 if `y` is not divisible by `x`, or the total count of pairs `(a, b)` within the range `[l, r]` where `a = i * x`, `b = z // i * x` (where `z = y // x`), `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, with each pair contributing 1 to the count if `a == b` and 2 if `a!= b`. **
