Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) within the given range [l, r] that satisfy the conditions GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Check for y being divisible by x**: The program first checks if y is divisible by x. If not, it immediately returns 0, as the conditions cannot be satisfied. This is a valid optimization.

2. **Calculating z**: The program calculates z as y // x, which represents the factor by which a and b must be spaced apart to satisfy the LCM condition.

3. **Iterating through factors of z**: The program iterates through the factors of z, which correspond to the possible values of i such that a = i * x and b = z // i * x. This ensures that a and b are in the correct ratio to satisfy the GCD and LCM conditions.

4. **Checking conditions for (a, b)**: For each potential pair (a, b), the program checks if l <= a <= r, l <= b <= r, GCD(a, b) == x, and LCM(a, b) == y. If these conditions are satisfied, it increments the count accordingly (1 for a == b, 2 for a!= b).

5. **Accounting for symmetry**: The program correctly accounts for the symmetry between (a, b) and (b, a) by adding 2 to the count when a!= b, ensuring that both pairs are counted.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases correctly. It optimizes the calculation by checking for divisibility and only iterating through factors of z, making it efficient for large inputs. 

In conclusion, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
