Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r, GCD(a, b) = x, and LCM(a, b) = y.

Here's why:

- It first checks if y is a multiple of x, which is a necessary condition for the existence of good pairs (a, b) because GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. If x does not divide y, it immediately returns 0, which is correct.

- It then iterates over all possible factors i of z = y / x, where z is an integer because y is a multiple of x. For each factor i, it computes a = i * x and b = z / i * x. 

- The conditions l ≤ a ≤ r and l ≤ b ≤ r ensure that both a and b are within the given range.

- The conditions math.gcd(a, b) == x and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y verify that the pair (a, b) satisfies the conditions for being a good pair. However, since a and b are constructed such that their GCD is x and their LCM is y (given the factorization of z), these conditions are inherently satisfied, making them somewhat redundant but serving as an additional check.

- If a equals b, it increments the count by 1; otherwise, it increments the count by 2, accounting for both (a, b) and (b, a) as distinct pairs.

The logic seems comprehensive, covering the generation of potential pairs and their verification against the constraints given in the problem description. Without a specific counterexample where the program fails to produce the expected output, we must conclude that the program is correct based on the problem description and the examples provided.
