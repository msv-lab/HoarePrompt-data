The code `G_pos = line.index('G')` assigns the index of the character 'G' in the string `line` to the variable `G_pos`. Since 'G' appears exactly once in the string, this operation will succeed and `G_pos` will be assigned a value between 0 and `n-1`, inclusive.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`**
