The print statement prints the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables do not change. The code does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program except for printing 'YES' to the output. 
The state of all variables remains the same as the initial state: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'T' otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'G' otherwise, and the current value of `reachable` is `True`. 
'YES' has been printed at the output.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'T' otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `reachable` is `True`, and 'YES' has been printed to the output.**
