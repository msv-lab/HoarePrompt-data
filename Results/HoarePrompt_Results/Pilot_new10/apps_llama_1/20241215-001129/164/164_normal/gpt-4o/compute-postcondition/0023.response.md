The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
`n` remains an input integer, 
`k` remains an input integer greater than 0, 
`line` remains the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, 
`G_pos` remains the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, 
`T_pos` remains the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T`, or the original index of 'G` otherwise, 
`G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, 
`pos` remains the current `pos + k`, and 
`reachable` remains as previously determined based on the loop's body.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T`, or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is the current `pos + k`, `reachable` is as previously determined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
