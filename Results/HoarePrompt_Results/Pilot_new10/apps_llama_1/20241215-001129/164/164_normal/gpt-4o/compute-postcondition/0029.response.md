Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G` otherwise. The current value of `reachable` is `True`, indicating that there is a path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step size of `k` without encountering '#'.**
