Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem statement allows the grasshopper to jump in both directions (left and right), but the provided code only considers jumps to the right. When `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, the code simply swaps their positions, but it does not consider the case where the grasshopper needs to jump left to reach the target.

For example, if the input is `5 2` and the string is `#T#G#`, the code will output `NO` because it only considers jumps to the right, but the grasshopper can actually jump left to reach the target. 

A correct solution would need to consider both left and right jumps, and check if there is a path from the grasshopper's position to the target's position in either direction. 

The output hints agree with the code and highlight the issue with the code, as they mention that the code prints 'YES' if there is a path from 'G' to 'T' with a step size of `k` without encountering '#', but they do not account for left jumps. 

This case is not covered in the examples provided, but it is a valid input according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
