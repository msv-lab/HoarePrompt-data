Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. It only checks if there is a path from the grasshopper to the insect by jumping forward from the grasshopper's position with a step size of `k`, without encountering any obstacles (`#`). However, according to the problem description, the grasshopper can jump to any empty cell that is exactly `k` cells away, either to the left or to the right.

Here's why the program does not meet the requirements:

- The program only checks for a path from the grasshopper to the insect by jumping forward, but it does not consider jumping backward.
- The program does not handle the case where the grasshopper is initially to the right of the insect and needs to jump backward to reach it.
- The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it encounters an obstacle (`#`) while checking the path from the grasshopper to the insect, but it does not consider alternative paths that might be available by jumping around the obstacles.

For example, if the input is:

```
7 3
..G##..T
```

The grasshopper can reach the insect by jumping backward with a step size of `3`, but the program will not consider this path because it only checks for a forward path.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider both forward and backward jumps, as well as to handle cases where the grasshopper is initially to the right of the insect. The program should also explore alternative paths when encountering obstacles.

Here is a revised version of the function that correctly implements the problem description:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited.add(G_pos)
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        
        for jump in [k, -k]:
            new_pos = pos + jump
            
            if 0 <= new_pos < n and line[new_pos]!= '#' and new_pos not in visited:
                queue.append(new_pos)
                visited.add(new_pos)
    
    print('NO')
```
This revised version uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the grasshopper to the insect, considering both forward and backward jumps. It also handles cases where the grasshopper is initially to the right of the insect. If a path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
