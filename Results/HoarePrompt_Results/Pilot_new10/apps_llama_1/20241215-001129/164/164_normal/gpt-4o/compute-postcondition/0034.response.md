The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and an input string. `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), and the input string is of length `n` and consists of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. 

However, you haven't provided the return value for the function. Since the return value is missing, I'll describe the functionality based on the given parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and an input string of length n with specific character constraints, but the return value is not specified.**
