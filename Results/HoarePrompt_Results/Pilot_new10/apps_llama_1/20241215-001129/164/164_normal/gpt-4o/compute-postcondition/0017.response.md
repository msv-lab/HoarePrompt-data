The break statement is used to terminate the loop entirely. Since we are directly inside a loop or if statement when the break statement is encountered, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change. 

The condition `pos` is `T_pos + k` if `T_pos + k` is less than or equal to `T_pos + 1`, otherwise the loop ends. However, for any `k` greater than 0, `T_pos + k` will always be greater than `T_pos + 1` when `k` is greater than 1, and `T_pos + k` will be equal to `T_pos + 1` when `k` equals 1, given that `T_pos` and `k` are integers. But the condition `T_pos + k` is less than or equal to `T_pos + 1` will fail when `k` is greater than 1. Since the loop ends when the condition fails and `k` is greater than 0, `k` must be equal to 1 for `pos` to be equal to `T_pos + k`. If `k` equals 1, then `pos` equals `T_pos + 1`. Therefore, when the break statement is encountered, `pos` must be `T_pos + 1` because `k` equals 1 for the loop to not have ended before the break statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is 1, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `T_pos + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
