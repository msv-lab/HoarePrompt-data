The code `g = i` updates the value of `g` to be equal to the current value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `g` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `i` is 2, `g` is 2, `t` is -1 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` of string `s`, `n` must be greater than 2**
