You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. 

One potential issue with the program is that it assumes that the grasshopper can only jump in one direction (from the 'G' to the 'T' position) and does not consider the case where the grasshopper jumps in the opposite direction. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 2
G..T#.
```
In this case, the grasshopper can jump over the obstacles from the 'G' position to the 'T' position. However, the program will not be able to find this path because it only checks for the path from 'G' to 'T' in one direction. 

To fix this issue, the program should also consider the case where the grasshopper jumps in the opposite direction. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the 'G' and 'T' positions are the same (i.e., `g == t`). In this case, the program should print "YES" because the grasshopper is already at the target position.

The given code does not handle these cases correctly, so its correctness is False. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif g == t:
        print('YES')
    else:
        queue = deque([g])
        visited = set([g])
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            for next_pos in [current + k, current - k]:
                if next_pos < 0 or next_pos >= n:
                    continue
                if next_pos not in visited and s[next_pos]!= '#':
                    if next_pos == t:
                        print('YES')
                        return
                    queue.append(next_pos)
                    visited.add(next_pos)
        print('NO')
```
This corrected version of the function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible jumps from the 'G' position and checks if it can reach the 'T' position. It handles the case where the grasshopper jumps in the opposite direction and also handles the case where the 'G' and 'T' positions are the same.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer from 2 to 100, and k is a positive integer from 1 to n-1. The second line is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    g, t = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `g` is the index of 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of 'T' in `s`.
    if (g == -1 or t == -1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t -
    g) // k + 1))) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `g` is the index of 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of 'T' in `s`, and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters, then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T`. If 'G' or 'T' is not found in `s`, 'NO' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `g` is the index of 'G' in `s` and `t` is the index of 'T' in `s`, and if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters, then 'YES' has been printed. In all other cases, 'NO' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input, the first line containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, and the second line a string of length `n` with specific characters, and it prints 'YES' if the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k` and the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters; otherwise, it prints 'NO', assuming the input is well-formed and 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
