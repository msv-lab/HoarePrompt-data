Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the line where it checks if the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters.

The condition `all(s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` is incorrect. This condition checks if all cells that are `k` steps away from `g` or `t` are not obstacles, but it does not consider the case where the grasshopper jumps over obstacles.

According to the problem description, the grasshopper can jump over obstacles, so the presence of obstacles between the grasshopper and the insect should not prevent the grasshopper from reaching the insect, as long as the grasshopper can jump over them.

The correct condition should only check if the cell at index `g` and the cell at index `t` are not obstacles, and if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k`.

Here's an example where the program fails to follow the problem description:

Input:
```
5 2
#G#T.
```

In this case, the program will print 'NO' because it checks the cell at index `(g + k) % n` which is an obstacle. However, according to the problem description, the grasshopper can jump over obstacles, so it should print 'YES'.

To fix this issue, the condition should be modified to only check if the cell at index `t` is reachable from the cell at index `g` by jumping `k` steps, without considering the obstacles in between. One possible solution is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to check if the insect can be reached from the grasshopper's position.
