Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue with the code is that it checks if the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters. However, this check is not sufficient because the grasshopper can jump over obstacles.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the grasshopper needs to jump over an obstacle to reach the target. For example, consider the input:

```
7 3
T..#..G
```

In this case, the grasshopper can jump from index 6 to index 3, and then from index 3 to index 0, thus reaching the target. However, the code will print 'NO' because it checks if the substring from `g` to `t`, stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters, which is not the case here.

The code should be modified to check if there is a sequence of jumps that allows the grasshopper to reach the target, considering the possibility of jumping over obstacles. 

The condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` does not account for the fact that the grasshopper can jump over obstacles. 

To fix this, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as using a queue for BFS, to explore all possible jumps and check if the target can be reached. 

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([g])
        visited.add(g)
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if current == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for direction in [-k, k]:
                next_index = (current + direction) % n
                if next_index not in visited and s[next_index]!= '#':
                    queue.append(next_index)
                    visited.add(next_index)
        print('NO')
```
