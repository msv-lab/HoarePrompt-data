The variable `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `i` is 2, `g` and `t` are -1 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` of string `s`, and `t` equals `i` equals 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `i` is 2, `g` is -1 or 1, `t` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2**
