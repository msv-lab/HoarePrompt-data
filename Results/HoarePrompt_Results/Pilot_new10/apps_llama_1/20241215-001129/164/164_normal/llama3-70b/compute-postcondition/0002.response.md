The code initializes two new variables, `g` and `t`, and assigns them the value -1. The initial state of `n`, `k`, and `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `g` is -1, `t` is -1**
