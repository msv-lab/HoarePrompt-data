Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 0 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as the else part is not defined. Additionally, `g` remains -1 in all cases.**
