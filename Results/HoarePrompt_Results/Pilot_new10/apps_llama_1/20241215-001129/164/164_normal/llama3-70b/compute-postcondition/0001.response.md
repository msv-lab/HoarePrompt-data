The code `s = input()` assigns the input string to the variable `s`. The input string is of length `n` and consists of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. 

The states of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once.**
