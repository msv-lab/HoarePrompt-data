Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 1 and `g` is -1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 0 and `t` is -1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` is -1 and `t` is -1.**
