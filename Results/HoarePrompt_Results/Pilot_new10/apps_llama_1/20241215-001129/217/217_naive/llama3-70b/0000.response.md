Correctness: **False**.

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the sequence in descending order and then distributing the elements into sequences b and c in an alternating manner. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of B - C.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: Consider the input sequence [-100, 99]. The program will sort the sequence to [-100, 99], then distribute the elements into sequences b and c as follows: b = [-100], c = [99]. The sums will be B = -100 and C = 99, resulting in B - C = -199.

However, the optimal solution would be to choose b = [99] and c = [-100], resulting in B = 99 and C = -100, and therefore B - C = 199.

This demonstrates that the provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases, specifically when the input sequence contains a mix of large positive and negative numbers. 

The correct program should consider all possible combinations of elements in sequences b and c to find the maximum value of B - C, not just an alternating distribution after sorting. 

For example, a correct program could use a brute-force approach with bit manipulation to generate all possible subsets of the input sequence and calculate B - C for each subset. 

Here's a simple example of how this could be implemented:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        b = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask & (1 << i)):
                b += a[i]
            else:
                c += a[i]
        max_diff = max(max_diff, b - c)
    print(max_diff)
```
