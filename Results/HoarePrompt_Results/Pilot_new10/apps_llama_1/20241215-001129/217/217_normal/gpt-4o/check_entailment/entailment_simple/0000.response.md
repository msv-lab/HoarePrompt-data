Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

- The program reads the input sequence of integers and calculates the sum of all positive integers (`B`) and the sum of all negative integers (`C`).
- It then computes the difference `B - C`, which represents the maximum possible value of `B - C` according to the problem description.
- The program handles all possible cases, including:
  - Sequences with only positive integers: In this case, `B` will be the sum of all integers, and `C` will be 0, resulting in `B - C` being the sum of all integers, which is the maximum possible value.
  - Sequences with only negative integers: In this case, `B` will be 0, and `C` will be the sum of all integers, resulting in `B - C` being the negation of the sum of all integers, which is the maximum possible value.
  - Sequences with a mix of positive and negative integers: In this case, the program correctly calculates the sum of positive integers (`B`) and the sum of negative integers (`C`), resulting in the maximum possible value of `B - C`.
  - Sequences with zeros: Zeros are ignored in the calculation of `B` and `C`, which is correct according to the problem description, as zeros do not contribute to the sum.

The key insight is that the maximum possible value of `B - C` is achieved by including all positive integers in `B` and all negative integers in `C`. This is because the sum of positive integers is maximized when all positive integers are included, and the sum of negative integers is minimized (i.e., maximally negative) when all negative integers are included. The program correctly implements this strategy, making it correct according to the problem description.
