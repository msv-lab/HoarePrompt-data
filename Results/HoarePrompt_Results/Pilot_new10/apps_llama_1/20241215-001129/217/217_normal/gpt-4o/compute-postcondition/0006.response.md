The function `func` does not seem to take any parameters as defined, which might be an oversight in the problem description. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems like the function should accept a sequence of integers. Given the constraints and assuming the function is supposed to take a sequence of integers as input, we can describe the functionality as follows:

The function accepts a sequence of integers. The sequence has between 1 and 100 integers, and each integer in the sequence is between -100 and 100, inclusive. 

However, without a clear description of the output or return value based on the input parameters, we cannot accurately complete the functionality description. The output section is missing, which is necessary to determine what the function returns based on the input sequence of integers.

If we were to hypothetically describe the functionality with an assumed output (for example, the function returns the sum of the sequence), it might look something like this:

Functionality: **The function accepts a sequence of integers, with the sequence length between 1 and 100 and each integer in the range -100 to 100, and returns a value based on the sequence.** 

Since the actual output or return value is not specified, the above description is incomplete and based on an incorrect assumption. 

To correctly answer this, we would need the output or return value description to understand how the function utilizes the input sequence of integers to produce a result. 

Given the missing output description and adhering strictly to the format requested but acknowledging the oversight in the problem statement, a more accurate reflection of the task would be to state that the problem as presented lacks necessary details for a complete description of the function's functionality. 

Thus, without making assumptions beyond the provided information:

Functionality: **The function's intended parameters and return values are not fully specified.**
