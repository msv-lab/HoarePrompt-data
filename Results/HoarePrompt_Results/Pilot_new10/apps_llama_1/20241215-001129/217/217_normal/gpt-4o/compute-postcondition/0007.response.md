The function func accepts a sequence of integers as input, where the first integer represents the number of elements in the sequence. It then calculates the sum of all positive integers in the sequence (B) and the sum of all negative integers in the sequence (C). The function prints the difference between B and C.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a sequence of integers, calculates the difference between the sum of all positive integers and the sum of all negative integers in the sequence, and prints the result. **
