The code calculates the sum of all positive integers in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `B`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the number of integers in the list `a`. The list `a` itself also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -100 and 100, `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`.**
