The function accepts a sequence of integers as input, where the first integer represents the count of subsequent integers, sorts these integers in descending order, calculates the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices, and then prints the difference between these two sums, without explicit validation for input format or range, assuming the input adheres to specified constraints.
