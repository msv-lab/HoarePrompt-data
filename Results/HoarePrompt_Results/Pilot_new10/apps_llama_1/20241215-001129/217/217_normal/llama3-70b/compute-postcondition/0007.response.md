Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is an odd number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 100, since the precondition restricts `n` between 1 and 100 and although this does not directly affect the value of `i` which came from the condition to be odd we keep `n` as a range between 1 and 100 as we cannot infer more about `i`, nor can change this property of `n` and the other variables**
