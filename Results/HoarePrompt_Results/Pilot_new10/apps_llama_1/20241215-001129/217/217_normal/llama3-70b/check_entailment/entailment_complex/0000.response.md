Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements belonging to sequence b, and C is the sum of elements belonging to sequence c. The program attempts to calculate this by sorting the input sequence in descending order and then summing elements at even indices and odd indices separately. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of B - C.

The issue with the program is that it assigns elements to sequences b and c based solely on their index after sorting, without considering the actual values of the elements. This means that small positive numbers or large negative numbers could be added to sequence c (the sum we want to minimize), even if it would be more beneficial to add them to sequence b (the sum we want to maximize) to increase the value of B - C.

For example, consider the input sequence [1, -2, 0]. The program sorts this sequence in descending order to get [1, 0, -2], then assigns the elements at even indices to sequence b (1 + 0 = 1) and the elements at odd indices to sequence c (-2). However, according to the problem description, we can choose b = {1, 0} and c = {-2}, which results in B = 1 and C = -2, giving us B - C = 3. The program's approach of assigning elements based on their index after sorting does not allow for this optimal allocation.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible partitions of the input sequence into two sequences b and c, calculate the sums B and C for each partition, and then find the maximum value of B - C. The program does not do this, so it is not correct according to the problem description. 

Here is an example of a correct solution in python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        b = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask & (1 << i))!= 0:
                b += a[i]
            else:
                c += a[i]
        max_diff = max(max_diff, b - c)
    print(max_diff)
```
