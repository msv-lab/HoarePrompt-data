Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program. 

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 1. 
- `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order.
- If the current `i` is even, then `i` is an odd number, `b` is 0, `c` is set to `a[i]`.
- If the current `i` is odd, then `i` is an even number, `b` is set to `a[0]`, `c` is 0.

When the code `b += a[i]` is executed, the value of `b` is updated.

If `i` is even (which means it becomes an odd number after some operation, but for the sake of this condition, we consider its initial value), `b` initially is 0 and `c` is `a[i]`. So, `b` becomes `0 + a[i]`, which simplifies to `a[i]`.

If `i` is odd (which means it becomes an even number after some operation, but for the sake of this condition, we consider its initial value), `b` initially is `a[0]` and `c` is 0. So, `b` becomes `a[0] + a[i]`.

Thus, the new value of `b` depends on whether `i` is initially even or odd. Given that `a` is sorted in descending order, `a[0]` is the largest number in the list, and `a[i]` will be a value from the list, which could be any value between -100 and 100 depending on `i`.

Since `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 1, and given the conditions on `i` being even or odd and their implications on `b` and `c`, the update of `b` is the only change. The values of `n`, `a`, and the conditions on `i` remain unchanged. 

The value of `c` and the parity (evenness or oddness) of `i` do not directly influence the calculation of `b` in this step, but they are part of the initial state and should be considered as remaining unchanged unless directly modified by the code, which in this case, they are not.

Therefore, the output state, considering all given conditions and the execution of `b += a[i]`, is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order. If the current `i` is even, then `b` is `a[i]`, `c` is set to `a[i]`. If the current `i` is odd, then `b` is `a[0] + a[i]`, `c` is 0.**
