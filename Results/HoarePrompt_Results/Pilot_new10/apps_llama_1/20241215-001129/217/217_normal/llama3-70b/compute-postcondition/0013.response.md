Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order. If `i` is even, then `b` is set to `a[i]` and `c` is set to `a[i]`. If `i` is odd, then `b` is set to `a[0] + a[i]` and `c` is set to 0 when `i % 2 == 0`, otherwise when `i % 2!= 0`, if `i` is even, `b` is 0 and `c` is 2 * `a[i]`, if `i` is odd, `b` is `a[0]` and `c` is `a[i]`.**
