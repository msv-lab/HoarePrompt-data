Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used while maintaining the required ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This is achieved by using the `min` function to find the smallest whole number of lemons that can be used, considering the available number of lemons, apples, and pears.

The program works as follows:

- Reads the number of lemons `a`, apples `b`, and pears `c` as input.
- Calculates the minimum number of whole lemons that can be used while maintaining the required ratio. This is done by comparing the available number of lemons `a` with the number of apples `b` divided by 2 and the number of pears `c` divided by 4. The smallest of these values is selected using the `min` function.
- Prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which is the minimum number of lemons `min_lemon` plus twice that number of apples `min_lemon * 2` plus four times that number of pears `min_lemon * 4`.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For input (2, 5, 7), the output is 7, which corresponds to using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
- For input (4, 7, 13), the output is 21, which corresponds to using 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.
- For input (2, 3, 2), the output is 0, which means that Nikolay cannot use any fruits to cook the compote because there are not enough pears.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, as it takes into account the minimum number of whole lemons that can be used while maintaining the required ratio of fruits. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
