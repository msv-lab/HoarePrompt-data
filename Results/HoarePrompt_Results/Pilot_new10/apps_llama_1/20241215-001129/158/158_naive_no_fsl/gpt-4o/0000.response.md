Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem. The key idea is to find the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available number of apples and pears, given the required ratio of 1:2:4.

The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used. The `min` function ensures that we do not exceed the available number of lemons, apples, or pears.

The line `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` then correctly calculates the total number of fruits that can be used, given the required ratio.

All the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. For instance, in the first example, `a = 2`, `b = 5`, and `c = 7`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 1` and `total_fruits = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
