The value of `c` is updated to be the integer input from the user. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Since `c` was originally 4 times the value of `a`, and `a` is still an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000, `a`'s range is still valid but its relation to `c` is no longer valid as `c` now takes a new value from the user. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
