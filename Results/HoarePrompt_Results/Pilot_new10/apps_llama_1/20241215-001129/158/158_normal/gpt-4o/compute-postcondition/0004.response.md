To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000,
- `b` is an input integer,
- `c` is an input integer,
- `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

The code snippet is:
```python
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

This can be simplified to:
```python
total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 7
```

So, `total_fruits` is assigned the value of `max_lemons` multiplied by 7. The value of `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000,
- `b` is an input integer,
- `c` is an input integer,
- `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`,
- `total_fruits` is 7 times the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is equal to 7 * `max_lemons`**
