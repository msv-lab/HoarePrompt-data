You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote, given the ratio of 1:2:4. The key to the solution lies in finding the minimum number of lemons that can be used, which is constrained by the available number of lemons, apples, and pears.

The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, considering the available number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The `//` operator is used for integer division, which ensures that the number of apples and pears is an integer multiple of the required ratio.

The total number of fruits is then calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which corresponds to the number of lemons, apples, and pears used, respectively.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the examples provided. For instance, in the first example, `a = 2`, `b = 5`, and `c = 7`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 1` and outputs `7`, which is the total number of fruits used (`1` lemon, `2` apples, and `4` pears).

In the second example, `a = 4`, `b = 7`, and `c = 13`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 3` and outputs `21`, which is the total number of fruits used (`3` lemons, `6` apples, and `12` pears).

In the third example, `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, the program correctly calculates `max_lemons = 0` and outputs `0`, since there are not enough pears to cook the compote.

After analyzing the code and testing it with various inputs, I couldn't find any case where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, and the ratio of lemons to apples to pears in the compote should be 1:2:4.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
