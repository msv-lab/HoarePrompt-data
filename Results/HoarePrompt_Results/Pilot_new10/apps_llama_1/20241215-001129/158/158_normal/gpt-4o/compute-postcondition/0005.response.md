The code snippet provided is a print statement for the variable `total_fruits`. The print statement does not modify any variables; it only outputs the value of `total_fruits` to the console. 

Given that `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is equal to 7 * `max_lemons`, and given the initial state constraints: `a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, we can infer that `max_lemons` will be the smallest integer value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`, and `total_fruits` will be 7 times this minimum value.

Therefore, the value of `total_fruits` that is printed is 7 times the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. However, the print statement itself does not alter the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, or `total_fruits`. The variables retain their values as defined before the print statement.

The Output State after executing the print statement remains the same concerning the values of the variables, but we have the additional information that the value of `total_fruits` has been printed.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` equals 7 * `max_lemons` and its value has been printed**
