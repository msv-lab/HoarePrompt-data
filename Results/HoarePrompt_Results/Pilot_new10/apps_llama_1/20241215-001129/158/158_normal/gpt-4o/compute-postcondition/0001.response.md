The code `b = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `b`. The previous value of `b` was 2 times `a`, but this is no longer valid after the code is executed. The new value of `b` is an input integer. The states of the other variables `a` and `c` are not directly affected. However, the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is no longer valid. 

Since `b` can take any integer value, the condition that `b` is 2 times `a` is no longer valid. `c` is still 4 times the original value of `a`, but this relationship with the new `b` is not valid. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 4 times the original `a` and is a positive integer such that 4 <= `c` <= 4000.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 4 times the original `a` and is a positive integer such that 4 <= `c` <= 4000**
