Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The program takes the input values `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively.
2. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits and the ratio of 1:2:4. This is done using the line `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.
	* `a` is the number of lemons available.
	* `b // 2` is the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available apples (since each lemon requires 2 apples).
	* `c // 4` is the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available pears (since each lemon requires 4 pears).
	* The `min` function returns the smallest of these three values, ensuring that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available supply of any fruit.
3. Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits that can be used, calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This represents the total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote, based on the ratio of 1:2:4.

Since the program correctly determines the maximum total number of fruits that can be used, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The use of the `min` function ensures that the program handles cases where there are insufficient fruits to cook the compote, in which case it will print 0.

For example, if the input values are `a = 2`, `b = 5`, and `c = 7`, the program will calculate `min_lemon = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`, and then print `1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 4 = 7`, which is the correct output. Similarly, if the input values are `a = 4`, `b = 7`, and `c = 13`, the program will calculate `min_lemon = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`, and then print `3 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 21`, which is also the correct output.
