To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state provides that `a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, and `c` is also a new input integer, with the constraints `1 <= a <= 1000`, `1 <= b <= 1000`, and `c` is an input integer without a specified range.

The code line `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` introduces a new variable `min_lemon` and assigns it the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

- `a` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `b` remains a new input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `c` remains a new input integer.
- `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, half of `b` (since `b // 2` performs integer division, which means any fractional part is discarded), and a quarter of `c`.

Given these considerations, the output state includes the initial conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the new condition for `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is a new input integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a new input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
