The code `b = int(input())` updates the value of `b` to be an input integer. The previous value of `b`, which was `2 * (original value of a)`, is overwritten. The conditions `1 <= a <= 1000`, `1 <= b <= 1000`, and `1 <= c <= 1000` still apply for `a` and `c`, but `b` now takes on a new input integer value.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is the original integer equal to `4 * (original value of a)`, and the conditions `1 <= a <= 1000`, `1 <= b <= 1000`, and `1 <= c <= 1000` apply, but `b` and `c` no longer follow the 1:2:4 ratio with the new `a`.**
