Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem description. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The program first reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) as input.
2. It then calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed, considering the ratio of 1:2:4. This is done by the line `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which ensures that the program doesn't try to form more sets than it has fruits for.
3. Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits in these sets by calculating `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This correctly calculates the total number of fruits used, assuming `min_lemon` sets are formed.
4. The program handles cases where Nikolay can't use any fruits correctly, as `min_lemon` will be 0 if any of `a`, `b // 2`, or `c // 4` are 0, resulting in an output of 0.

For example, if the input is 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, `min_lemon` will be 1 (because `min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4)` is 1), and the output will be `1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 4 = 7`, which is the correct answer.

Similarly, if the input is 4 lemons, 7 apples, and 13 pears, `min_lemon` will be 3 (because `min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4)` is 3), and the output will be `3 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 21`, which is also the correct answer.

In the case where the input is 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, `min_lemon` will be 0 (because `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4)` is 0), and the output will be `0 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4 = 0`, which is the correct answer because Nikolay can't use any fruits in this case. 

This shows that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description, and therefore it is correct.
