Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote. 

Here's how it works:
- It takes the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input from the user.
- It calculates the minimum number of sets of fruits that can be formed with the given ratio (1 lemon: 2 apples: 4 pears) by finding the minimum value among the number of lemons, the number of apples divided by 2, and the number of pears divided by 4.
- It then prints the total number of fruits in these sets, which is the minimum number of sets multiplied by the sum of the fruits in a set (1 + 2 + 4 = 7).

This approach ensures that the ratio of 1:2:4 is maintained and that whole fruits are used.

For example, given 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, the code correctly calculates that only 1 set can be formed (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears), resulting in a total of 7 fruits used.

In another example, given 4 lemons, 7 apples, and 13 pears, the code correctly calculates that 3 sets can be formed (3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears), resulting in a total of 21 fruits used.

The code also correctly handles cases where not enough fruits are available to form a set, such as when given 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, the code prints 0 because no set can be formed with the given ratio.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples that demonstrate the correctness of the code. Therefore, the code accurately implements the problem description for all potential cases.
