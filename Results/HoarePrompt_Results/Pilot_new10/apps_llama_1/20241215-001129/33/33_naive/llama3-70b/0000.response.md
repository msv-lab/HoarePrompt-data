Correctness: **True**

The program provided accurately checks the three conditions given in the problem description. 

1. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.
2. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole.

The program uses the latitude of the current position (`curr_lat`) and updates it based on the direction and distance traveled. It also checks if the current position is at the North or South Pole and if the direction is valid at those positions.

The program handles all the examples provided and produces the correct output for each of them. Additionally, the program correctly checks for the boundary conditions (i.e., latitude less than -90 or greater than 90) and exits with 'NO' if any of these conditions are met.

The program also checks for the mid-travel pole condition and handles it correctly, stopping the journey with 'NO' if Limak tries to travel in an invalid direction from the pole.

Overall, after reviewing the code and testing it with various inputs, it seems that the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, making it a correct implementation.
