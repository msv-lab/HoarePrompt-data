According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 50, this condition is already met. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, input is a sequence of `n` movements, `curr_lat` is 90**
