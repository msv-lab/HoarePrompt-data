The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since there's no loop provided in the given code snippet, we'll consider the context where this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop structure that isn't shown here. However, based solely on the information given and the nature of the `continue` statement, we can infer its impact.

Given that `continue` does not alter the values of variables but rather the flow of the program, the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged. The program simply moves on to the next iteration of the loop it is part of, without executing any code that might follow the `continue` statement within the same loop iteration.

Therefore, after the execution of the `continue` statement, the state of the variables remains as follows:
- `n` is still an integer greater than 0.
- `t` is still an integer.
- `dir` is still a string input.
- `curr_lat` is still within the range [-90, 90].

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
