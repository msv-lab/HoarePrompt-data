The code converts the string `t` to an integer using `int(t)`. The previous value of `t` was a string input. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], and `t` is now an integer, 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]**
