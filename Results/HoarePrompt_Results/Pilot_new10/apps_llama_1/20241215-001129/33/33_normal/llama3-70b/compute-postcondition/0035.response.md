The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, so no further code is executed after this point. The states of the variables `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` are not affected by the `exit()` function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90], and the program has terminated**
