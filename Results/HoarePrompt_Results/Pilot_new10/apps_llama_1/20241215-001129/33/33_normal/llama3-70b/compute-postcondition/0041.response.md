The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program. When `exit()` is called, the program stops execution immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program ends. The previous print statement 'NO' is still valid as it was printed before the program terminated. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, the program has printed 'NO' and the program has terminated**
