The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged. 

The program has printed 'NO', and the states of the other variables are not affected. The conditions related to `curr_lat` being within the range [-90, 90] also remain unchanged. 

Since `curr_lat` is either within the range [-90, 90] or the program has terminated with `curr_lat` bounded by this range, this condition still holds after printing 'NO'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, the program has printed 'NO', and if `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], the program continues, otherwise, it has terminated with `n`, `t`, and `dir` retaining their respective values and `curr_lat` being bounded by the range [-90, 90] at the point of termination.**
