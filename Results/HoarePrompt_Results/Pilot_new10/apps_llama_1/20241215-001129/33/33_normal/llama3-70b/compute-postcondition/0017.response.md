Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, the program has stopped execution and 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, the execution continues with `curr_lat` being within the range [-90, 90].**
