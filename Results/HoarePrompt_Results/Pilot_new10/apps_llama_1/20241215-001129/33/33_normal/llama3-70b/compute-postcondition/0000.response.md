The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The input is a sequence of movements, but this specific line of code only reads an integer, which is the number of movements. 

The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) as per the given constraints.

The other information in the initial state about the sequence of movements (distance and direction) is still valid, but it has not been used or changed by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), the input is a sequence of `n` movements, each consisting of a non-negative integer distance (t) and a direction (dir) that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), the input is a sequence of `n` movements, each consisting of a non-negative integer distance (t) and a direction (dir) that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".**
