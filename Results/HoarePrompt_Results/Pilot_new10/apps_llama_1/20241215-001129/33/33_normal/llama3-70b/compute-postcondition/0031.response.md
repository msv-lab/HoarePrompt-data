The given code is a `continue` statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration in a loop. Since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the effect of the `continue` statement is not explicitly visible. However, in general, the `continue` statement does not modify any variables; it only affects the control flow.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `t` is an integer
- `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither
- `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]
- `dir` is 'North' if `curr_lat` is -90, or any of the allowed values if `curr_lat` is not -90
- `curr_lat` is less than 90 or `dir` is 'South' if `curr_lat` is 90

None of these variables are modified by the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement affects the loop's control flow but does not change the values of any variables directly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90] and `dir` is 'North' if `curr_lat` is -90, or any of the allowed values if `curr_lat` is not -90, and `curr_lat` is less than 90 or `dir` is 'South' if `curr_lat` is 90, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
