Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither. If `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], the program continues. If `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90], the program has terminated, with `n`, `t`, and `dir` retaining their respective values, and `curr_lat` being bounded by the range [-90, 90] at the point of termination.**
