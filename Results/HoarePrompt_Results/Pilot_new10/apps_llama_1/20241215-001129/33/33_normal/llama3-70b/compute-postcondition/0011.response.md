The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we assume that this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop structure not shown here.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50
- `curr_lat` is 90
- `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement
- `dir` is the second part of the input movement
- The direction `dir` is not 'North'
- `dir` is not 'South'

The `continue` statement does not modify any of the given variables directly. It affects the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the enclosing loop, but without the loop's context, we can only state that it does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is the second part of the input movement, `dir` is not 'North', `dir` is not 'South', and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
