The input is split into two parts and assigned to `t` and `dir`. The value of `t` becomes the integer value of the first part of the input movement. The value of `dir` becomes the second part of the input movement, which can be 'North', 'South', or neither. The states of the other variables are not affected.

The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1.
The value of `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90].

However, considering the new value of `dir`, if `curr_lat` is -90, then `dir` must be 'North'. If `curr_lat` is 90, then `dir` must be 'South'. For other values of `curr_lat`, `dir` can be 'North', 'South', or neither.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90] and `dir` is 'North' if `curr_lat` is -90, or any of the allowed values if `curr_lat` is not -90, and `curr_lat` is less than 90 or `dir` is 'South' if `curr_lat` is 90**
