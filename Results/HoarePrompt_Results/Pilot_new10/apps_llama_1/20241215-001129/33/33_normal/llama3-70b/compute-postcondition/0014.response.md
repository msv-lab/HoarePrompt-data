Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement. If `dir` is 'North', then the current value of `curr_lat` was updated to `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was updated to `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` is 90. The current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90.**
