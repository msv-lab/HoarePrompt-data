Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. Otherwise, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90] with `dir` being 'North' if `curr_lat` is -90, or any of the allowed values if `curr_lat` is not -90, and `curr_lat` is less than 90 or `dir` is 'South' if `curr_lat` is 90.**
