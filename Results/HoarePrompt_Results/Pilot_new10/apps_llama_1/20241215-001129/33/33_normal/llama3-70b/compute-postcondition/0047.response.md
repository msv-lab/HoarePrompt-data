The code subtracts `t / 111.195` from `curr_lat`. The value of `n` is an integer greater than 0, but it is not affected by the code. The value of `t` is an integer, and it is also not directly affected by the code, but it is used in the calculation. The value of `dir` is a string input, and it is not affected by the code. The value of `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90] initially, and it is updated by subtracting `t / 111.195` from it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is `curr_lat` - `t` / 111.195**
