The code sets `curr_lat` to 90. The initial state provides information about `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 50, and the sequence of movements. However, this information is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, the input is a sequence of `n` movements, each consisting of a non-negative integer distance (t) and a direction (dir) that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", `curr_lat` is 90**
