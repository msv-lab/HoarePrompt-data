The given code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution and no further code is run. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. For any other direction, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and 'NO' has been printed. The program has been terminated.**
