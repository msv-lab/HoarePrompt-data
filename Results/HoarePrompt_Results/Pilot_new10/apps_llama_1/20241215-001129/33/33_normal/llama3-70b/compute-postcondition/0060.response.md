To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code updates the `curr_lat` variable based on the direction and distance of each movement. If the direction is 'North', `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. If the direction is 'South', `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If the direction is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged.

The output states after a few iterations indicate that the loop continues to execute as long as `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90] and the direction is valid. If `curr_lat` is outside this range or the direction is invalid, the program prints 'NO' and terminates.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state can be determined as follows:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, which represents the number of movements.
- `t` and `dir` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
- `curr_lat` is updated based on the directions and distances of all movements. If the final direction is 'North' and `curr_lat` is not -90, or if the final direction is 'South' and `curr_lat` is not 90, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]. If `curr_lat` is outside this range or the final direction is invalid, the program has terminated and printed 'NO'.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), the values of the variables remain unchanged, and `curr_lat` is still 90.

However, since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, the loop will always execute at least once. Therefore, the output state can be determined based on the final values of `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` after all iterations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the distance of the last movement, `dir` is the direction of the last movement, `curr_lat` is the final latitude after all movements, and if `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], it is updated based on the directions and distances of all movements, otherwise, the program has printed 'NO' and terminated.**
