The given code snippet prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` is equal to 90, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the distance of the last movement, `dir` is the direction of the last movement, and `curr_lat` is the final latitude after all movements. 

Since `curr_lat` is either within the range [-90, 90] or the program has printed 'NO' and terminated, and now the program is printing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the current value of `curr_lat`, we can conclude that the program has not terminated. 

Therefore, `curr_lat` must be within the range [-90, 90]. 

The code prints a value based on `curr_lat`, but it does not modify any of the variables. 

So, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the distance of the last movement, `dir` is the direction of the last movement, `curr_lat` is the final latitude after all movements and is within the range [-90, 90], and a value ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed based on the value of `curr_lat`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the distance of the last movement, `dir` is the direction of the last movement, `curr_lat` is the final latitude after all movements and is within the range [-90, 90], and a value ('YES' if `curr_lat` is 90, 'NO' otherwise) has been printed**
