The code converts the variable `t` to an integer. The initial value of `t` was the first part of the input movement. After the conversion, `t` becomes an integer representation of the first part of the input movement. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is the second part of the input movement**
