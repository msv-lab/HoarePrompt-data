Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is the integer part of the user's input, `dir` is the string part of the user's input, if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`, otherwise the state of `valid` and `position` depend on the direction and previous state, if `dir` is not 'West' or 'East', then the state of `n`, `t`, `dir`, `position`, and `valid` remains unchanged**
