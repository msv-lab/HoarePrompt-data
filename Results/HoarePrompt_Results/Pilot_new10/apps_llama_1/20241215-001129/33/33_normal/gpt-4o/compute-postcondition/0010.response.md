The value of `position` is decreased by `t`. The initial state of `position` and `valid` is not specified, so we consider all possibilities. If `position - t` is less than 0, then `position` becomes 0 and `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, `position` is decreased by `t`. The states of `n` and `dir` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `dir` is 'North', `t` is an integer input by the user, if `position - t` is less than 0, then `position` is 0 and `valid` is `False`, otherwise `position` is `position - t` and `valid` remains unchanged**
