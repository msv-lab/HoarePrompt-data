Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `position` is 0, `valid` is True, `t` is an integer input by the user, `dir` is a string input by the user and the current value of `dir` is 'North'. The current value of `position` minus `t` is less than 0, which implies that `t` is greater than `position` since `position` is 0, this means `t` is greater than 0**
