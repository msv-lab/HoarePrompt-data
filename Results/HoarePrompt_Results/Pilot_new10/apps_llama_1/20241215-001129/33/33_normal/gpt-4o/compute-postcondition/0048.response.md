Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer representing the first part of the user's input, `dir` is the second part of the user's input, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `_`, and if `position - t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`, otherwise the state of `valid` and `position` may have changed based on previous `dir` and `t`.**
