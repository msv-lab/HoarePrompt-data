Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer input by the user, `dir` is a string input by the user and is not 'North' or 'South'. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is False, otherwise, the state of `valid` is unchanged. If `dir` is neither 'West', 'East', 'North', nor 'South', the state of all variables remains unchanged.***
