Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer input by the user, `dir` is a string input by the user. If `dir` is 'North', then if `position - t` is less than 0, `position` is 0 and `valid` is `False`, otherwise `position` is `position - t` and `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `t` and if `t` is greater than 10000, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`, otherwise, the state of `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is neither 'West', 'East', 'North', nor 'South', the state of all variables remains unchanged, with `position` being 0 and `valid` being True as initially given.**
