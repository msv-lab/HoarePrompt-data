Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer representing the first part of the user's input, `dir` is the second part of the user's input, `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `_`. If `position` is within the range 0 to 20000 (inclusive), the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`.**
