The code `t = int(t)` converts the string `t` to an integer. The previous values of `n`, `dir`, `position`, `valid`, and `_` are not affected by this conversion. The value of `t` is updated to be the integer equivalent of its original string value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer representing the first part of the user's input, `dir` is the second part of the user's input, `position` and `valid` may have changed based on previous `dir` and `t`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`**
