The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input, converted to an integer, to the variable `n`. The input is the number of journey parts. 

The precondition is still valid after the code has been executed, so `n` is the number of journey parts and it holds a value between 1 and 50 (inclusive), because the input constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.

The output state after running this code will be that `n` holds the number of journey parts which is a positive integer with a value between 1 and 50 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), representing the number of journey parts**
