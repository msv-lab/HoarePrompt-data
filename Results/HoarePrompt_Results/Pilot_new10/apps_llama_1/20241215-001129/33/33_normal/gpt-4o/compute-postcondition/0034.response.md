The value of `valid` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is the integer part of the user's input, `dir` is the string part of the user's input, `position` and `valid` depend on the direction and previous state, and `valid` is `False`.
