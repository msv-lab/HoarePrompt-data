According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 0, `high` is the smallest integer in `v`. Since `low` is 0, for the loop to execute, `high` must be greater than 0. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order as input by the user, `low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 0**
