The code `n, s = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `s` based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` expression splits the input into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `s`, respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `s` is a positive integer
- There is a list of `n` integers `v` where each `v_i` is a positive integer
- `1 <= n <= 10^3`
- `1 <= s <= 10^12`
- `1 <= v_i <= 10^9`

After executing the code, `n` and `s` are updated with the new values from the input. The list `v` and its properties remain unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, there is a list of `n` integers `v` where each `v_i` is a positive integer, `1 <= n <= 10^3`, `1 <= s <= 10^12`, and `1 <= v_i <= 10^9`**
