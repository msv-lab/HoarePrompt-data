Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description and correctly finds the minimum level of kvass in the least keg such that the total amount of kvass poured is equal to the target amount `s`. 

Here's why:

1. The program sorts the list of keg volumes `v` in ascending order. This is necessary because the problem statement asks for the maximum level of kvass in the least keg. By sorting the kegs, the program can consider the smallest kegs first and ensure that the level of kvass in the least keg is maximized.

2. The program uses a binary search to find the minimum level of kvass in the least keg. The binary search iterates over the possible levels of kvass in the least keg and checks if the total amount of kvass that can be poured is less than or equal to the target amount `s`.

3. After the binary search, the program checks if the total amount of kvass that can be poured at the found level is exactly equal to the target amount `s`. If it is, the program prints this level as the result. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it is not possible to pour exactly `s` liters of kvass.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- When the target amount `s` is less than the total amount of kvass in the smallest keg, the program will correctly print -1.
- When the target amount `s` is greater than the total amount of kvass in all kegs, the program will correctly print -1.
- When the target amount `s` can be achieved by pouring from the kegs, the program will correctly print the maximum level of kvass in the least keg.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem description. It correctly implements the binary search approach to find the maximum level of kvass in the least keg and handles all potential cases correctly.
