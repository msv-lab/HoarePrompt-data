The value of `low` is updated to `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `low` is `(high + 1) // 2`, `high` is greater than 0, `mid` is `(high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v`. The current value of `total` is less than `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `low` is `(high + 1) // 2`, `high` is greater than 0, `mid` is `(high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v`, and `total` is less than `s`.**
