Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `low` and `high` have converged such that `low` is the minimum value where the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is greater than or equal to `s`, or the closest value to this condition without exceeding `s` if such an exact value does not exist, with `low` being equal to or one more than `high` at termination. If the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is equal to `s`, then `low` has been returned and printed at the output. Otherwise, -1 has been printed because the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`.***
