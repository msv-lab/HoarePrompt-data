The code line `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `v` to be a list of integers input by the user. The previous information about `v` having `n` integers where each `v_i` is a positive integer is overwritten by the new input.

However, considering the context provided in the initial state, it seems like `n` and `s` were intended to be used in the context of the list `v`. But since `n` is described as an input integer and the code line provided directly assigns a new value to `v` based on user input without referencing `n` for the number of elements, we must infer that `v` now holds a list of integers as input by the user, regardless of the value of `n`.

The value of `s` remains unaffected by this operation. The initial constraints on `n`, `s`, and the elements of `v` are not directly applied in this code line, but we should note them for understanding the potential scope of `n`, `s`, and the original intention for `v`.

Given this, the output state after executing the provided code line is: 
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input integer.
- `v` is a list of integers as input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of integers as input by the user**
