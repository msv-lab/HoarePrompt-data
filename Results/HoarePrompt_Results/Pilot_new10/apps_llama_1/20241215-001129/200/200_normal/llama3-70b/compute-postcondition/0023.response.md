Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `low`, and `mid` remains equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is updated to `(low + (mid - 1) + 1) // 2`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. In both cases, `total` is the sum of the minimum between the updated `mid` (or the original `mid` if `total` < `s`) and each element in `v`.***
