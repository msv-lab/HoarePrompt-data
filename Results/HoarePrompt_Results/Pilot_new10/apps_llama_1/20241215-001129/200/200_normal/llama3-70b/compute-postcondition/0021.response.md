The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, the new value of `low` is also `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `low` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `(low + high + 1) // 2` and each element in `v`**
