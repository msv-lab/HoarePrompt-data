`mid` is assigned the value of the average of `low` and `high` rounded down and then added 1, which is the integer division of `low + high + 1` by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`**
