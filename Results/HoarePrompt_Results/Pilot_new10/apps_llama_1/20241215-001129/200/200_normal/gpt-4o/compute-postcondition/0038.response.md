Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, and `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` equals `volumes[0]` if `remaining_kvass` is 0, otherwise `min_keg_volume` equals `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `remaining_kvass` is between 0 and the original value of `s` (inclusive), and `min_keg_volume` has been printed.**
