You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements described in the problem statement. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The program starts by taking two inputs: the number of kegs `n` and the volume of the glass `s`.
2. It then takes `n` integers representing the volumes of the kegs and sorts them in ascending order.
3. If the total volume of the kegs is less than the volume of the glass, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to pour the glass by `s` liters of kvass. This is correct because the Fair Nut cannot pour more kvass than is available in the kegs.
4. If the total volume is greater than or equal to `s`, the program finds the minimum volume that can be left in the least keg.
5. It does this by initializing `min_keg_volume` to the volume of the smallest keg and then iterating over the kegs.
6. For each keg, it calculates the amount of kvass that can be taken from the keg without making its volume less than `min_keg_volume`. This is done using the line `possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`.
7. The program then subtracts `possible_to_take` from `remaining_kvass` and continues this process until `remaining_kvass` becomes `0` or it has iterated over all the kegs.
8. If `remaining_kvass` is still greater than `0` after iterating over all the kegs, it means that the Fair Nut needs to take more kvass from the kegs to fill the glass. In this case, the program calculates the amount of kvass that needs to be taken from each keg to fill the glass and subtracts this amount from `min_keg_volume`.
9. Finally, the program prints `min_keg_volume`, which represents the minimum volume that can be left in the least keg after pouring the glass by `s` liters of kvass.

After analyzing the code, I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The code handles all possible scenarios, including cases where the total volume of the kegs is less than the volume of the glass, and cases where the Fair Nut needs to take different amounts of kvass from different kegs to fill the glass. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts parameters n and s, and a list v_i, calculates the total volume of all kegs, and if the total volume is less than s, prints -1; otherwise, it calculates the minimum keg volume that can be used to fill n kegs with a total volume of at least s, considering the case where there is remaining kvass after filling all kegs, and prints this minimum keg volume. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
