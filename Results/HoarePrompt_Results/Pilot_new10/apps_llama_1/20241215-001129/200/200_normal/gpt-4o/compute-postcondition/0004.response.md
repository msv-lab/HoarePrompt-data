Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, and the current value of `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes` and is less than `s`.**
