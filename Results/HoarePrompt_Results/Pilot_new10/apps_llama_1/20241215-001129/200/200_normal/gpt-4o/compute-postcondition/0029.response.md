The value of `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`. The value of `possible_to_take` is `min(volumes[2] - volumes[0], remaining_kvass)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 2, `possible_to_take` is `min(volumes[2] - volumes[0], remaining_kvass)`, `remaining_kvass` is `remaining_kvass - min(volumes[2] - volumes[0], remaining_kvass)`**
