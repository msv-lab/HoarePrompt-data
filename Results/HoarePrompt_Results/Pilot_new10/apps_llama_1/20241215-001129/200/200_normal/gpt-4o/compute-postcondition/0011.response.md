The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we assume it is part of a larger loop structure, likely a for or while loop iterating over the `volumes` list or related to the `i` index. 

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the values of the variables do not change directly due to this statement. The `continue` statement affects the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the loop, but without the loop structure, we can't determine what exactly is skipped or what the next iteration will entail. 

However, since the `continue` statement itself does not alter any variable's value, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the understanding that the program flow skips to the next iteration of its enclosing loop.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, the current value of `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, and the current value of `i` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
