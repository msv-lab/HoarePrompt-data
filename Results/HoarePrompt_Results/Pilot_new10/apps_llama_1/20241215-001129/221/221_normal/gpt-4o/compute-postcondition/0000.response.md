The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b` bitwise XOR `x`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `b`, and `s` is not used in the given code. 

The states of `s` and `x` are not affected by the code. Therefore, `s` is still an integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12 and `x` is still an integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12, `a` is equal to `b` ^ `x`**
