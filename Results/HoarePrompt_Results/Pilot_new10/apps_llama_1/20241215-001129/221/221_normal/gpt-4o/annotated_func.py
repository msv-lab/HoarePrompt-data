#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are integers such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function attempts to perform bitwise operations using undefined variables `x`, `a`, and `b`, resulting in undefined behavior due to the lack of initial values and the absence of parameter `s` mentioned in the annotations.
