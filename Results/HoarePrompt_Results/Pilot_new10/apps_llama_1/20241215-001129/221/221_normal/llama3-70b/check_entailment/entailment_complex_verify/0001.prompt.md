You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it only checks for values of 'a' up to 's-1'. However, 'a' can be equal to 's/2' and 'b' can also be equal to 's/2' when 'x' is 0 (because 'a ^ b' is equal to '0' when 'a' and 'b' are equal), but 's/2' cannot be checked by this program if 's' is even. 

Another issue with the program is that it only checks values of 'a' up to 's-1', but 'b' is calculated as 's - a', so this program will not check the case where 'a' is greater than 's/2' and 'b' is less than 's/2'.

For example, the input "10 0" will not work correctly with this program because the only possible solution is (5, 5), but this program will not check it. The correct output for this input should be 1, but the program will print 0.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x and a > 0 and b > 0:
            count += 1
    print(count)

```
However, this correction will still fail when 's' is even and 'x' is 0, because it will count (s/2, s/2) twice.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to check all possible combinations of 'a' and 'b' such that 'a + b = s' and 'a ^ b = x', which can be achieved by using the following corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x and a > 0 and b > 0:
            if a == b:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 2
    print(count)
```
This program checks all possible combinations of 'a' and 'b', and counts each combination twice if 'a' and 'b' are different, and counts it once if 'a' and 'b' are the same.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are integers such that 2 <= s <= 10^12 and 0 <= x <= 10^12.
def func():
    s, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the original input integer, `x` is the original input integer, `a` is `s-1`, `b` is `1`, and `count` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a ^ b == x` for `a` ranging from 1 to `s-1` and `b = s - a`.
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `s` and `x`, where `2 <= s <= 10^12` and `0 <= x <= 10^12`, and prints the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a` ranges from 1 to `s-1`, `b = s - a`, and `a ^ b == x`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
