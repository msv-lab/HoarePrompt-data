Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only checks for pairs `(a, b)` where `a` ranges from 1 to `s-1` and `b = s - a`. However, the problem description states that `a` and `b` are positive integers, which means `b` can also range from 1 to `s-1` and `a = s - b`. The program does not account for this case.

For example, in the case where `s = 9` and `x = 5`, the program correctly counts the pairs `(2, 7)`, `(3, 6)`, `(6, 3)`, but it only counts `(7, 2)` implicitly because it checks `(2, 7)` and increments the count. However, in the case where `s = 3` and `x = 3`, the program counts `(1, 2)` but not `(2, 1)` explicitly because `b = s - a` will only be 1 when `a` is 2, and the loop only goes up to `s-1`.

The program should be modified to also check for `b` ranging from 1 to `s-1` and `a = s - b`, or it should be modified to explicitly count both cases for each pair. 

One possible modification is to add a conditional statement to check if `a!= b` and if so, increment the count by 2, otherwise increment the count by 1. This is because if `a!= b`, then both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are valid solutions, but if `a == b`, then only one solution is valid.

Here is a possible modification to the program:
```python
def func():
    s, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            if a!= b:
                count += 2
            else:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```
