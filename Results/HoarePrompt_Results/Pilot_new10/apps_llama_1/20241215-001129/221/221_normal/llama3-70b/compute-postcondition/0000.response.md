The initial state specifies that `s` and `x` are integers such that `2 <= s <= 10^12` and `0 <= x <= 10^12`. However, the code `s, x = map(int, input().split())` overrides these initial values by taking new integer inputs for `s` and `x`.

After executing this line of code, `s` and `x` are assigned the values from the input, which are converted to integers. The constraints `2 <= s <= 10^12` and `0 <= x <= 10^12` no longer apply because `s` and `x` are now determined by the user's input, not by their initial ranges.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
