You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it only checks for values of 'a' up to 's-1'. However, 'a' can be equal to 's/2' and 'b' can also be equal to 's/2' when 'x' is 0 (because 'a ^ b' is equal to '0' when 'a' and 'b' are equal), but 's/2' cannot be checked by this program if 's' is even. 

Another issue with the program is that it only checks values of 'a' up to 's-1', but 'b' is calculated as 's - a', so this program will not check the case where 'a' is greater than 's/2' and 'b' is less than 's/2'.

For example, the input "10 0" will not work correctly with this program because the only possible solution is (5, 5), but this program will not check it. The correct output for this input should be 1, but the program will print 0.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x and a > 0 and b > 0:
            count += 1
    print(count)

```
However, this correction will still fail when 's' is even and 'x' is 0, because it will count (s/2, s/2) twice.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to check all possible combinations of 'a' and 'b' such that 'a + b = s' and 'a ^ b = x', which can be achieved by using the following corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x and a > 0 and b > 0:
            if a == b:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 2
    print(count)
```
This program checks all possible combinations of 'a' and 'b', and counts each combination twice if 'a' and 'b' are different, and counts it once if 'a' and 'b' are the same.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `s` and `x`, where `2 <= s <= 10^12` and `0 <= x <= 10^12`, and prints the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a` ranges from 1 to `s-1`, `b = s - a`, and `a ^ b == x`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
