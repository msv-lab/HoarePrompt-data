According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list has at least one more element after the current `num`, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements and the `num` is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr`**
