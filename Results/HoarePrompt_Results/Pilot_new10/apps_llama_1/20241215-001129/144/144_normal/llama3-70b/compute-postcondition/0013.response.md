The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `mex` is not specified, so we can only conclude that `mex` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `arr`, and `mex` is increased by 1**
