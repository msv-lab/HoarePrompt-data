To analyze the functionality of the given function, let's break down the steps and consider the potential edge cases and missing logic.

1. **Input**: The function takes no direct parameters but accepts two inputs:
   - An integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`.
   - A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` where for each integer `a_i`, `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Processing**:
   - The input list `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The function then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest positive integer `mex` that does not exist in the list.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it encounters a number greater than `mex`, or if it finds a number equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the smallest positive integer `mex` that is not present in the input list `arr`.

4. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - If the input list contains all positive integers from 1 to `n`, `mex` will be `n+1`.
   - If the list contains numbers greater than `n` but misses some numbers between 1 and `n`, `mex` will be the smallest missing number in that range.
   - The function handles duplicate numbers in the input list correctly because it sorts the list and only checks for the presence of `mex` in the list.
   - If the list is empty (which contradicts the given constraint that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` but is a potential programming error), the function will not behave as intended because it relies on the list having at least one element.
   - The function does not validate the input constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`) and assumes they are always met.

5. **Return Postconditions**:
   - Since the function prints the result instead of returning it, the return postcondition is implicitly that the printed value is the smallest positive integer missing from the sorted input list.

Based on this analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer n and a list of n integers, sorts the list, and prints the smallest positive integer (starting from 1) that is not present in the sorted list, handling cases where the list may contain duplicates or numbers greater than n, but assuming the input constraints are met. **
