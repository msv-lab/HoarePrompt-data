The input includes an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The value of `n` is now determined by the input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the list of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 exists but is not yet defined in the code**.
