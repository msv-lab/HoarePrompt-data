The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a list of integers to the variable `arr`. The integers are obtained by splitting the input string into substrings separated by spaces, and then converting each substring to an integer using the `int` function. 

The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and there is a list of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. However, these integers are not yet defined in the code.

Since the code is using `input().split()` to get the list of integers, it is expected that the input will be a string containing n space-separated integers.

After executing the code, the variable `arr` will hold a list of n integers, which are the same as the integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}. The value of `n` is still an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
