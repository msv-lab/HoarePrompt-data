It seems like the provided function definition is incomplete as it doesn't accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, I'll describe the expected functionality.


The function `func` is expected to accept two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`. The integer `n` is constrained between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), and each integer `a_i` in the list is constrained between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).


Since the output cases are not provided, I'll describe the general functionality based on the given constraints.


Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a list of n integers, returns a value based on the input parameters n and the list of integers, considering the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each integer a_i.**
