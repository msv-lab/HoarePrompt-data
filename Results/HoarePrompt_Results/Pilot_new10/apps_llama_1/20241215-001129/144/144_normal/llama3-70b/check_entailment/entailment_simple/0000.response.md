Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately follows the problem description and meets all its requirements. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input correctly, taking into account the format specified in the problem description (an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers).

2. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array `arr`, the program ensures that it can efficiently iterate through the numbers in ascending order, which is essential for finding the minimum positive integer (mex) that doesn't appear in the array.

3. **Finding the MEX**: The program's logic for finding the mex is sound. It starts with `mex = 1` and increments `mex` whenever it encounters a number in the array that matches the current `mex`. If it encounters a number greater than `mex`, it breaks out of the loop because, at this point, it has found a number that can be reduced to fill in any missing numbers less than `mex`, thus ensuring `mex` is the smallest number not in the array or a potential candidate for the maximum mex after applying operations.

4. **Considering Operations**: Although it's not explicitly stated in the code comments, the logic inherently considers the possibility of applying operations to decrease numbers in the array. By finding the smallest number `mex` that isn't present and then considering numbers larger than `mex`, the program effectively determines the maximum mex achievable by potentially reducing numbers in the array. This is because once a number greater than `mex` is found, the program understands that this number can be reduced to fill any gap, thus supporting the achievable mex value of `mex`.

5. **Outputting the MEX**: Finally, the program prints the `mex` value, which represents the maximum possible mex of the array after applying operations according to the problem description.

In summary, the program's logic ensures that it accurately determines the maximum possible mex of the array by iteratively checking for the presence of integers starting from 1 and considering the impact of potential operations to decrease numbers, aligning perfectly with the requirements specified in the problem description.
