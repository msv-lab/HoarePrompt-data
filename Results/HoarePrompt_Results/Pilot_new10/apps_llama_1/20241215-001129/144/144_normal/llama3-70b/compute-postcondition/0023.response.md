The code `print(mex)` simply prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest number that is not present in `arr`. 

Since `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order and for each integer `a_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, the value of `mex` is the smallest positive integer that is not in `arr`.

The states of the variables `n` and `arr` are not affected by the print statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order where for each integer `a_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `mex` is the smallest number that is not present in `arr` and the value of `mex` has been returned as output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order where for each integer `a_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `mex` is the smallest number that is not present in `arr` and the value of `mex` has been returned at the output.**
