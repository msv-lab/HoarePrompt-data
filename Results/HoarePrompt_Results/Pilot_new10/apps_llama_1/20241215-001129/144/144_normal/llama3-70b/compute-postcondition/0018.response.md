The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same, which is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. The value of `arr` remains the same, which is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `arr` has at least 3 elements. The value of `num` remains the same, which is the third element in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `arr` has at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `mex` is increased by 1 from its previous value**
