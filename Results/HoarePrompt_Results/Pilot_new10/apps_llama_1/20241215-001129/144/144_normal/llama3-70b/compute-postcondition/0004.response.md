According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr` and `num`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers and `n` is between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `arr` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, `num` will be the first element in `arr`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr`**
