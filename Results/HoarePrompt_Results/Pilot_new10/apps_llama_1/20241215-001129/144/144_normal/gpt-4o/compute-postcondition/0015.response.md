The value of `mex` is printed. The value of `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a` plus one. The states of the other variables are not affected. The last element in `a` is still `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a` plus one and has been returned at the output, `num` is the last element in `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `mex` has been returned at the output and is the smallest positive integer not present in `a` plus one, `num` is the last element in `a`.**
