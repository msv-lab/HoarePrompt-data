The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `mex`. The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged as the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers from the input, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, in ascending order, `mex` is 1**
