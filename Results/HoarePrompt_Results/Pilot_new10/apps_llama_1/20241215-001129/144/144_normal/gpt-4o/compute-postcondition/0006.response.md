The code increments the value of `mex` by 1. The previous value of `mex` was 1, so the new value of `mex` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 2, `num` is the first element in the list `a` and `num` is greater than or equal to 1**
