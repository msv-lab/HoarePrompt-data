The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the floor division of the product of `a` and `b` by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the result of the floor division of their product by the outcome of `func_1(a, b)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are positive integers, and returns the floor division of their product by the return value of func_1(a, b).**
