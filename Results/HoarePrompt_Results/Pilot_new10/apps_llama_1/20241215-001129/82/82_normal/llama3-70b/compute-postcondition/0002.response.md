The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers. It attempts to return the floor division of the product of `a` and `b` by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. However, the function `func_1(a, b)` is undefined, which means that `func_2` will raise a `NameError` when trying to call `func_1(a, b)`. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, attempts to calculate the floor division of their product by the return value of an undefined function `func_1(a, b)`, but instead raises a `NameError` due to the undefined function. **
