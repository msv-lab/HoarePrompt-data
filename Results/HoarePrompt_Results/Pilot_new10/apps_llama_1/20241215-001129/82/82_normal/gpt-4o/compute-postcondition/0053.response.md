The value of `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `candidate` equals `diff // k`, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals the result of `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, `min_lcm` equals the result of `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, and `min_k` equals `candidate`.
