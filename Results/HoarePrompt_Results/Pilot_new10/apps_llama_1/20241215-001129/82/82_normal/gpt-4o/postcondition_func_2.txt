The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, returns 0 if `a` equals `b`, and otherwise attempts to find the factor `k` of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` that minimizes the LCM of the smallest multiples of `k` greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, returning 0 if the absolute difference is 1 or if no minimizing factor is found due to the nature of `diff` or its factors.
