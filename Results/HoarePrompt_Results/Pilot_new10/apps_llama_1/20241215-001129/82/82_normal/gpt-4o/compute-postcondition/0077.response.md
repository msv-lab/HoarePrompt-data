The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + diff // 2 - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + diff // 2 - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`**
