Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

In function `func_3(a, b)`, the loop only iterates up to the square root of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, which is an optimization for finding factors. However, when `diff` is 1, the loop does not execute because the range is empty (since `int(math.sqrt(1)) + 1` equals 2, but the actual upper limit for the range in the loop is `int(math.sqrt(diff))` which is 1 and the range function in python is exclusive of the end value), and the function does not check the case where `k` equals 1.

However, this case is indeed handled because `min_k` is initialized as 0, and there are no updates to `min_k` when `diff` equals 1. But the function still returns 0 which might not be the smallest `k` that minimizes the LCM.

The correct approach is to handle the case when `diff` equals 1 separately, by setting `min_k` to 1 when `diff` is 1, and then continuing with the rest of the function as before.

Another issue with the function is that when `diff` is not a perfect square and does not have any other factors besides 1 and itself, the loop does not execute, and `min_k` remains 0, which is incorrect. 

The function should check all possible factors of `diff`, not just those up to the square root of `diff`. But the use of `diff // k` in the loop does cover the factors greater than the square root, however the initial condition that leads to the for loop to run might not be met and thus the factor equal to `diff` itself is not considered.

To fix these issues, we should modify the loop to handle the case when `diff` equals 1, and also make sure that all factors of `diff` are considered.

Also, the case when `a` equals `b` is handled correctly, as the function returns 0 in this case.

The function `func_1(x, y)` and `func_2(x, y)` are used to calculate the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers, respectively. These functions seem to be correct and are used correctly in `func_3(a, b)`.

In conclusion, the code does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, and therefore its correctness is **False**. 

The given examples seem to be working fine with the given code but that does not cover all cases, for instance, cases where `diff` equals 1, or where `diff` is a prime number greater than its square root.
