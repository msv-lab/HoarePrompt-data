    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor of the original values of x and y, implying x itself since y is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y` and returns their greatest common divisor, handling all potential cases including when `y` is initially 0, in which case it returns `x`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of `x * y` divided by `func_1(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `func_1(x, y)` is a function with an unknown return value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the result of `x * y` divided by the result of `func_1(x, y)`, unless `func_1(x, y)` returns zero, in which case it will raise a ZeroDivisionError, and the actual result depends on the unknown behavior of `func_1(x, y)`

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is the absolute difference between the original `a` and `b`; `min_lcm` is the smallest achievable LCM of the smallest multiples of any factor of `diff` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`; `min_k` is the factor of `diff` that results in `min_lcm`. If `diff` is 1, then `min_lcm` is positive infinity and `min_k` is 0.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k, which is the factor of the absolute difference between a and b, or 0 if the absolute difference is 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, returns 0 if `a` equals `b`, and otherwise attempts to find the factor `k` of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` that minimizes the LCM of the smallest multiples of `k` greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, returning 0 if the absolute difference is 1 or if no minimizing factor is found due to the nature of `diff` or its factors.
