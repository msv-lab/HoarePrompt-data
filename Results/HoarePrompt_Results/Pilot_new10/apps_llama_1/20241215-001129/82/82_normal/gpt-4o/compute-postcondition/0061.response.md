To solve this, we'll consider the impact of the given code on the variables and their relationships as defined in the initial state.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` is 2.
- `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`.
- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

The code introduces a new variable `current_lcm` which is assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The function `func_2` is not defined here, but based on its name and the context, it likely calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`.

The initial state provides relationships between `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `new_b`, but does not directly impact the calculation of `current_lcm` except through `new_a` and `new_b`.

Since `func_2` is not defined, we can infer that `current_lcm` is set to the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. This means:
- `current_lcm` equals the LCM of the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a` and the largest multiple of `candidate` less than or equal to `b` when rounded up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

Considering the initial state's constraints and the new introduction of `current_lcm`, we have:
- `a` and `b` remain positive integers.
- `diff` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` remains 2.
- `candidate` remains `k` or `diff // k`.
- `new_a` remains the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` remains `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `current_lcm` is introduced as the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
