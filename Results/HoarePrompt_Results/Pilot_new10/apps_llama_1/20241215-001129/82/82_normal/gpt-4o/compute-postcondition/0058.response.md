According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `diff`. The loop iterates over a list containing two values: `k` and `diff // k`. For this loop to execute, `diff` must be greater than or equal to `k` to ensure that `diff // k` is a valid integer. 

Since `k` is given as 2, `diff` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute without any issues. Additionally, `candidate` will take the values of `k` and `diff // k` in each iteration.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, candidate is `k` or `diff // k`**
