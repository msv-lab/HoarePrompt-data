To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop condition and the possible values of the variables involved. 

The loop iterates over a list containing two values: `k` and `diff // k`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1 and `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`. 

For the loop to execute again, the next value in the list should be `diff // k`. 

Since `k` is 1, `diff // k` is equal to `diff`. 

So, at the start of the next iteration, `candidate` should be `diff // k`, which is equal to `diff`, and `k` remains 1.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `diff`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, `new_b` may have been updated in the loop body, but we don't have information about the exact updates. 

However, based on the given information, we can conclude the following:

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, `candidate` is `diff`, `k` is 1**
