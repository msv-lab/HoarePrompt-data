The value of `min_lcm` is updated to be equal to `current_lcm`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`**
