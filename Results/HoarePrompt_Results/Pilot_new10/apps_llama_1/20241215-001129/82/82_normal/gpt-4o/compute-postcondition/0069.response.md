To determine the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the given initial state. The code assigns a new value to `current_lcm` by calling `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments.

Given:
- `a` is a positive integer,
- `b` is a positive integer,
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`,
- `k` is 2,
- `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`,
- `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`,
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`,
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and the old value of `new_b`.

After executing `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`, the value of `current_lcm` changes to be the result of `func_2` applied to `new_a` and `new_b`. Since `func_2` is not defined in the problem statement, we assume it calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of its two arguments. Therefore, `current_lcm` becomes the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, `new_b`) do not change their values or definitions because of this operation. Only `current_lcm` is updated.

Thus, after the code execution:
- `a` remains a positive integer,
- `b` remains a positive integer,
- `diff` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`,
- `k` remains 2,
- `candidate` remains either `k` or `diff // k`,
- `new_a` remains `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`,
- `new_b` remains `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`,
- `current_lcm` becomes the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, calculated by `func_2`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
