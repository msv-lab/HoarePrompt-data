Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `candidate` equals `diff // k`, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals the result of `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, if `current_lcm` is less than the original `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals the original `min_lcm` but `candidate` is less than the original `min_k`, then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `candidate`.***
