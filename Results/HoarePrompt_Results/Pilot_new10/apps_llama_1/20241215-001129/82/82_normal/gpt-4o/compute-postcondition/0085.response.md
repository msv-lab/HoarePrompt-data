The function `func_3` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. According to the code, if `a` equals `b`, the function returns 0. If `a` and `b` are not equal, the function calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b` and then iterates over all factors `k` of `diff`. For each factor `k`, it calculates the smallest multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, and then uses a function `func_2` (not shown in the provided code) to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these two multiples. The function keeps track of the smallest LCM found so far and the corresponding factor `k`. If the absolute difference `diff` is 1, the function will not find any factor `k` (since the loop only iterates over factors from 1 to the square root of `diff`), and `min_lcm` will remain as positive infinity, but since no valid `k` is found, `min_k` remains 0. 

However, the annotations and return postconditions suggest specific behaviors, but the actual code's behavior might differ slightly due to the missing definition of `func_2` and the handling of edge cases like when `diff` is 1 or when `a` and `b` are very large numbers. The code does not explicitly handle cases where `diff` has no factors other than 1 and itself, which could lead to `min_k` being 0 for such cases as well.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, returns 0 if `a` equals `b`, and otherwise attempts to find the factor `k` of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` that minimizes the LCM of the smallest multiples of `k` greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, returning 0 if the absolute difference is 1 or if no minimizing factor is found due to the nature of `diff` or its factors. **
