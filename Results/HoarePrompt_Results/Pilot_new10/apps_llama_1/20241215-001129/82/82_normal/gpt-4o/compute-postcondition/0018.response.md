To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is at least 1.
- `candidate` is `diff`.
- `k` is 1.
- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

Code Snippet:
```python
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

This code calculates `new_b` by first adding `candidate - 1` to `b`, then performing integer division by `candidate`, and finally multiplying the result by `candidate`. This effectively rounds `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

Since `candidate` is equal to `diff`, and considering the properties of integer division and multiplication, `new_b` will be the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `candidate`, `k`, and `new_a` do not change due to this specific operation, except for the introduction of `new_b`.

Thus, the output state reflects the calculation of `new_b` based on `b` and `candidate` (which equals `diff`), while all other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `k` is 1, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`.**
