The new variable `min_k` is initialized and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`; `min_lcm` is positive infinity; `min_k` is 0.
