Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is at least 1, `candidate` equals `diff // 2`, `k` is 2, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `diff // 2`.***
