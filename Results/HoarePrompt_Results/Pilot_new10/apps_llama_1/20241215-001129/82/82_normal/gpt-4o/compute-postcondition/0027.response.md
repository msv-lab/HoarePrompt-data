The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `candidate`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is at least 1, `candidate` equals `diff // 2`, `k` is 2, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, and `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`**
