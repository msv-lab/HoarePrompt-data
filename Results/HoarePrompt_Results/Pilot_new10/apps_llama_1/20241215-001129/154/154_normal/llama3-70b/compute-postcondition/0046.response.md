The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given that `i` is 3 and `j` is 3, the update is `dp[3][3] = max(dp[3][3], dp[2][3 - t[2]] + 1)`. Since `dp[3][3]` equals `dp[3][2]` initially and `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, we know that `t[2]` is the time for the third subtask. However, without knowing the exact value of `t[2]`, we can say that `dp[3][3]` is updated to be the maximum of its initial value (`dp[3][2]`) and `dp[2][3 - t[2]] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 2, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[3][3]` equals `max(dp[3][2], dp[2][3 - t[2]] + 1)`, `i` is 3, `j` is 3.
