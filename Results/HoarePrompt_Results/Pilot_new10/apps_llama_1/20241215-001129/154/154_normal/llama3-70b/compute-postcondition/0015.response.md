The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `dp[1][3]` becomes equal to `dp[1][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[1][3]` equals `dp[1][2]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3.
