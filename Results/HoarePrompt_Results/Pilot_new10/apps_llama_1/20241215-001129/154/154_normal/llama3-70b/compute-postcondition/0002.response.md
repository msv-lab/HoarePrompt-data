The code `t.sort()` sorts the list `t` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are not affected by this operation. The list `t` initially contains `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask, and after sorting, it still contains the same `k` integers but in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), and `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order.**
