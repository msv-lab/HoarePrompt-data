The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are updated to the input values, where `n` is the number of tasks, `k` is the number of subtasks in each task, and `M` is the total time in minutes. The input function `input().split()` takes a string of space-separated integers as input and splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers by the `map(int,...)` function. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), and `t_j` (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000) is the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask of any task, for j = 1 to k.**
