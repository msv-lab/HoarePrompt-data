You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to use dynamic programming to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn, but it has a few issues.

One of the main issues with the program is that it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks. The program only considers solving subtasks from a single task, which is not the case in the problem description. The problem states that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order, which means he can switch between tasks.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn. The program uses a dynamic programming approach, but it does not consider the bonus point that Polycarp receives for completing a task.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of subtasks that Polycarp can solve within the given time limit. We need to use a more sophisticated dynamic programming approach that takes into account the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks and that he receives a bonus point for completing a task.

A correct solution to this problem would involve using a 3D dynamic programming array, where the dimensions represent the number of tasks, the number of subtasks, and the time limit, respectively. The program would then need to iterate over all possible combinations of subtasks and tasks, and calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit.

For example, if we consider the input `3 4 11` and `1 2 3 4`, the program should return `6`, because Polycarp can complete the first task and solve one subtask from the second task. However, the given program does not produce the correct output for this input.

Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:
```python
import itertools

def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_points = 0

    for subtasks in itertools.product(range(k + 1), repeat=n):
        time = 0
        points = 0
        for i, task_subtasks in enumerate(subtasks):
            for j in range(task_subtasks):
                time += t[j]
                points += 1
                if time > M:
                    break
            if time <= M and task_subtasks == k:
                points += 1
            if time > M:
                break
        max_points = max(max_points, points)

    print(max_points)

func()
```
This solution uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of subtasks, and then calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and M are integers, where n is the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is the number of subtasks in each task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), and M is the total time in minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), and t_j (1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000) is the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask of any task, for j = 1 to k.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[k][j]` is the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within `j` minutes, considering all `k` subtasks, or remains unchanged if `M` is 0.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
