Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to the time required to solve the subtask at index `i - 1` in `t`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.***
