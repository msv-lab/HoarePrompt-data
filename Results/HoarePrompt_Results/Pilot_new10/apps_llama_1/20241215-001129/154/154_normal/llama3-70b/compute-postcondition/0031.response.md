The given Python code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum value between its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), 
- `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, 
- `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, 
- `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, 
- `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[2][3]` equals `dp[2][2]`, 
- `i` is 2, 
- `j` is 3.

`dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, `dp[2][3]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`dp[2][2]`) and `dp[1][3 - t[1]] + 1`. 

Since `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers and `i - 1` equals 1, `t[i - 1]` equals `t[1]`, which is the time required to solve the first subtask. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), 
`k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, 
`M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, 
`t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, 
`dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[2][3]` equals the maximum of `dp[2][2]` and `dp[1][3 - t[1]] + 1`, 
`i` is 2, 
`j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[2][3]` equals the maximum of `dp[2][2]` and `dp[1][3 - t[1]] + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
