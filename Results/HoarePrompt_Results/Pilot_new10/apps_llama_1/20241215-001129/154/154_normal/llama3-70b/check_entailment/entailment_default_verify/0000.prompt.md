You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to use dynamic programming to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn, but it has a few issues.

One of the main issues with the program is that it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks. The program only considers solving subtasks from a single task, which is not the case in the problem description. The problem states that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order, which means he can switch between tasks.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn. The program uses a dynamic programming approach, but it does not consider the bonus point that Polycarp receives for completing a task.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of subtasks that Polycarp can solve within the given time limit. We need to use a more sophisticated dynamic programming approach that takes into account the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks and that he receives a bonus point for completing a task.

A correct solution to this problem would involve using a 3D dynamic programming array, where the dimensions represent the number of tasks, the number of subtasks, and the time limit, respectively. The program would then need to iterate over all possible combinations of subtasks and tasks, and calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit.

For example, if we consider the input `3 4 11` and `1 2 3 4`, the program should return `6`, because Polycarp can complete the first task and solve one subtask from the second task. However, the given program does not produce the correct output for this input.

Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:
```python
import itertools

def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_points = 0

    for subtasks in itertools.product(range(k + 1), repeat=n):
        time = 0
        points = 0
        for i, task_subtasks in enumerate(subtasks):
            for j in range(task_subtasks):
                time += t[j]
                points += 1
                if time > M:
                    break
            if time <= M and task_subtasks == k:
                points += 1
            if time > M:
                break
        max_points = max(max_points, points)

    print(max_points)

func()
```
This solution uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible combinations of subtasks, and then calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts input parameters n (number of tasks), k (number of subtasks per task), M (total available time), and a list of subtask times t, sorts the subtask times, and uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the given time M. It then calculates and prints a value based on the number of subtasks that can be completed within M and the number of subtasks where all previous subtasks can also be completed within M, effectively assessing the feasibility of completing tasks under given time constraints, albeit with a focus on subtask completion rather than task completion as a whole. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
