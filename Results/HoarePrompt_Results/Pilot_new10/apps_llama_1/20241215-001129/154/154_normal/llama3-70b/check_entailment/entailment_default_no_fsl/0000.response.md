Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately solve the problem as described. The problem asks for the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn by solving subtasks in any order, considering that he earns one point for each subtask solved and an extra point for completely solving a task. However, the code focuses on maximizing the number of subtasks completed within the given time without adequately addressing the task completion aspect and the associated extra points.

The issue arises in how the code calculates the final points. The line `print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))` attempts to sum the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed for each subtask type (`dp[i][M]`) and then adds extra points for each case where all previous subtasks can be completed (`dp[i][M] == i`). This approach does not correctly reflect the problem's requirement for calculating points, especially considering that the `dp` table is designed to track the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed up to a certain time limit, not necessarily the completion of full tasks.

Furthermore, the dynamic programming approach used does not fully consider the implications of solving tasks in any order or the extra point for completely solving tasks. The code seems to have a flaw in its logic regarding how it handles task completion and the distribution of time across tasks and subtasks to maximize points.

To correctly solve this problem, a more nuanced approach is needed, one that considers both the completion of individual subtasks for points and the strategic completion of entire tasks to maximize the extra points, all within the given time constraint. The current implementation does not align with the problem's requirements for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect.
