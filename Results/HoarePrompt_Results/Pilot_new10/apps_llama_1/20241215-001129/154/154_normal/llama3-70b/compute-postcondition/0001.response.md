The code `t = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate numbers, converts each number to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `t`.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, and `t_j` is the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask, we can infer that the input for `t = list(map(int, input().split()))` is a sequence of integers separated by spaces, which are the values for `t_j` where j ranges from 1 to `k`. 

Given this, the output state after executing the code is that `t` is a list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), and `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), and `t` is a list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask.**
