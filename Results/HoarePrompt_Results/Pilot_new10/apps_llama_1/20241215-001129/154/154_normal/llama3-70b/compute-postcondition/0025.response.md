According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `M`. If `j` is less than `M`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `M` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `M` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[2][1]` equals `max(dp[2][1], dp[1][1 - t[1]] + 1)`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
