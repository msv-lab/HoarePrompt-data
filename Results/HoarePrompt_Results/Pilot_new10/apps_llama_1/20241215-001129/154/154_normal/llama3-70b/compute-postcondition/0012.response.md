The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `dp[1][2]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`dp[1][1]`) and `dp[0][2 - t[0]] + 1`. 

Since `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `t[0]` is the smallest time required to solve a subtask. The value of `dp[0][2 - t[0]]` depends on the value of `t[0]`. If `t[0]` is greater than 2, then `dp[0][2 - t[0]]` is not a valid index. If `t[0]` is less than or equal to 2, then `dp[0][2 - t[0]]` is a valid index.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[1][2]` = max(`dp[1][2]`, `dp[0][2 - t[0]]` + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[1][2]` = max(`dp[1][1]`, `dp[0][2 - t[0]]` + 1) if 2 - t[0] is a valid index, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
