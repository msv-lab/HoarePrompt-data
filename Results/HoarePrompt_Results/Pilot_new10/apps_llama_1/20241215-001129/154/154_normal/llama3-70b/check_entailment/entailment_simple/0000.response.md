Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect interpretation of the problem**: The program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks. The program only considers solving subtasks from a single task, which is not the correct interpretation of the problem.

2. **Incorrect calculation of the maximum points**: The program calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the given time limit `M`, but it does not consider the bonus point that Polycarp receives for completing a task. The program adds a bonus point for each subtask that is solved, which is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect handling of task completion**: The program checks if `dp[i][M] == i` to determine if a task is completed, but this condition is not sufficient to guarantee that a task is completed. A task is completed if all its subtasks are solved, which is not necessarily the case when `dp[i][M] == i`.

4. **Incorrect calculation of the total points**: The program calculates the total points by summing the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the given time limit `M` for each subtask, and then adds a bonus point for each subtask that is solved. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks.

5. **Lack of consideration for the number of tasks**: The program does not consider the number of tasks `n` in its calculation, which is an important factor in determining the maximum points that Polycarp can earn.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed that takes into account the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks, and that he receives a bonus point for completing a task. The program should also correctly calculate the maximum points that Polycarp can earn based on the given time limit `M` and the number of tasks `n`. 

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible combinations of subtasks that can be solved within the given time limit `M`, and calculating the maximum points that can be earned for each combination. The combination that results in the maximum points should be selected as the solution. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()

    max_points = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            points = 0
            time = 0
            for _ in range(i):
                for subtask in range(j):
                    time += t[subtask]
                    points += 1
                    if time > M:
                        break
                if time > M:
                    break
                if j == k:
                    points += 1
            if time <= M and points > max_points:
                max_points = points

    print(max_points)

func()
```
This implementation correctly calculates the maximum points that Polycarp can earn based on the given time limit `M` and the number of tasks `n`. It iterates over all possible combinations of subtasks that can be solved within the given time limit `M`, and calculates the maximum points that can be earned for each combination. The combination that results in the maximum points is selected as the solution.
