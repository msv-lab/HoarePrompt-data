To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
- `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 2
- `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9)
- `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order
- `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 1

The loop statement is `for j in range(1, M + 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over all values from 1 to `M` (inclusive) for `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. There is no direct dependency on other variables like `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `dp`, or `i` for the loop to execute again, as the loop condition only depends on `j` and `M`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 2, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list, `i` is 3, `j` is 2**
