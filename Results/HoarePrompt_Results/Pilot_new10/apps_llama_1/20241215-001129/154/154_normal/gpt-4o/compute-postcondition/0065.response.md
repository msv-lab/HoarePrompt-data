The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The previous value of `subtasks_solved` is 0 and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // (first element of t)`. Other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`, `complete_tasks` is at least 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // (first element of t)`, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // (first element of t)`.
