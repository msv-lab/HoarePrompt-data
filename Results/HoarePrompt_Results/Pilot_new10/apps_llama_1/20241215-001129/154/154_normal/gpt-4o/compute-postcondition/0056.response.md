The value of `time_used` is updated to be `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. The previous value of `time_used` was `(complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`, but this change does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `subtasks_solved`, or `remaining_time`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` is still a positive integer, `k` is still a positive integer, `M` is still a non-negative integer, `t` is still a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is still the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is still determined by external conditions, `max_points` is still the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is still at least 1 more than its previous value, `subtasks_solved` is still the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, and `remaining_time` is still updated based on the solved subtasks.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is determined by external conditions, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` has been incremented by at least 1 and is now at least 1 more than its previous value, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, and `remaining_time` is updated based on the solved subtasks**
