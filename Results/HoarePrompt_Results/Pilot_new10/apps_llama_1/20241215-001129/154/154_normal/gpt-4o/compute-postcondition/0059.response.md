The given code `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)` updates the value of `points`. The value of `complete_tasks` is at least 1 more than its previous value, and `k` is a positive integer. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`k` is a positive integer, 
`M` is a non-negative integer, 
`t` is a list of `k` positive integers, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, 
`complete_tasks` has been incremented by at least 1 and is now at least 1 more than its previous value, 
`time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, 
and `remaining_time` is updated based on the solved subtasks. If `time_used` is greater than `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution with the updated values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` has been incremented by at least 1 and is now at least 1 more than its previous value, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the solved subtasks, and if `time_used` is greater than `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution with the updated values**
