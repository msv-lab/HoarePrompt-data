Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is determined by external conditions, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` has been incremented by at least 1 and is now at least 1 more than its previous value, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, and `remaining_time` is updated based on the solved subtasks. If `time_used` is greater than `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution with the updated values of `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `subtasks_solved`, and `remaining_time`.**
