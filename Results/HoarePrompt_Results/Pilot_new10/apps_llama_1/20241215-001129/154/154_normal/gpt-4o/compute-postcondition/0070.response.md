The code increments the `subtasks_solved` variable by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. Given that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1]`, we can substitute this into the equation for `subtasks_solved`. 

Since `subtasks_solved` initially is 1 and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1]`, `subtasks_solved` becomes `1 + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`k` is a positive integer, 
`M` is a non-negative integer, 
`t` is a list of `k` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`, 
`complete_tasks` is at least 1, 
`time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`subtasks_solved` is `1 + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1]`, 
`remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`subtask_time` is the second element of `t`, 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[1]`.
