Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers and must have at least 1 element, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`. The current value of `remaining_time` is `M - time_used` and it is greater than or equal to the current value of `subtask_time`, indicating that there is sufficient remaining time to complete the subtask.**
