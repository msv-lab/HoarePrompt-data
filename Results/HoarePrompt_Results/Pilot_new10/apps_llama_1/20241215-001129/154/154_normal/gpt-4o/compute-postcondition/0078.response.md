To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for subtask_time in t:
    if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
        max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
        subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
        remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
```
From the given output states, we can observe the following patterns:

* If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is incremented by the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the available `remaining_time`, and `remaining_time` is updated accordingly.
* If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, then the variables retain their original state.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* `n` is still a positive integer.
* `k` is still a positive integer.
* `M` is still a non-negative integer.
* `t` is still a list of `k` positive integers.
* `total_time_per_task` is still the sum of all elements in `t`.
* `points` is still `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
* `max_points` is still the maximum of its previous value and `points`.
* `complete_tasks` is still at least 1.
* `time_used` is still `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
* `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available `remaining_time`, which is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
* `remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving all possible subtasks, which is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`.

Since the loop iterates over all elements in `t`, the final value of `subtasks_solved` will be the sum of the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved for each `subtask_time` in `t`, given the available `remaining_time`. The final value of `remaining_time` will be the remaining time after solving all possible subtasks.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`, `complete_tasks` is at least 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `remaining_time` is 0 if `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is less than or equal to the sum of all `subtask_time` in `t`, otherwise it is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`.**
