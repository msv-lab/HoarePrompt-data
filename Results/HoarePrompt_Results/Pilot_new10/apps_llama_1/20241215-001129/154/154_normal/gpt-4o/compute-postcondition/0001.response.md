The code introduces a new variable `max_points` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

The initial state had the following variables and their respective values: 
n is a positive integer, 
k is a positive integer, 
M is a non-negative integer, 
t is a list of k positive integers, 
total_time_per_task is the sum of all elements in t.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, M is a non-negative integer, t is a list of k positive integers, total_time_per_task is the sum of all elements in t, max_points is 0**
