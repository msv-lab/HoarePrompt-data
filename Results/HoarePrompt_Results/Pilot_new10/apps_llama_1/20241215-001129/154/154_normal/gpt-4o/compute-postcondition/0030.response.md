The code calculates `time_used` as the product of `complete_tasks` and `total_time_per_task`. 

Given that `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, and `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is a positive integer. 

The value of `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, but its initial value is not given. 

So, `time_used` is assigned the value `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, and its value depends on the values of `complete_tasks` and `total_time_per_task`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the new `complete_tasks` and `subtasks_solved` is updated based on the new `complete_tasks`**
