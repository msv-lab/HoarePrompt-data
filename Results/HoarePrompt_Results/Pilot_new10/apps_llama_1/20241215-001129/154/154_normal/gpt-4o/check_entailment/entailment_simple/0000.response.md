Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not always produce the correct output according to the problem description. The issue lies in the way it calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time after completing a certain number of tasks.

In the line where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated, the program divides the remaining time by the time required to solve a subtask. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution because it does not consider the fact that the subtasks can be solved in any order.

For example, suppose we have 2 tasks, each with 2 subtasks that take 1 and 2 minutes to solve, respectively. If we have 5 minutes available, the program will first complete 2 tasks (which takes 6 minutes, but we only have 5, so it will not complete any tasks), then it will try to solve subtasks with the remaining time. In this case, the remaining time is 5 minutes, and it will solve 5 subtasks (which is incorrect because we can only solve a maximum of 2 tasks).

However, the optimal solution would be to complete 1 task (which takes 3 minutes) and then solve 1 subtask from the second task (which takes 1 minute). This way, we can earn 4 points (3 points for completing 1 task and 1 point for solving 1 subtask), which is the maximum number of points we can earn with 5 minutes.

To fix this issue, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, that takes into account the fact that subtasks can be solved in any order.

Here's an example of how a correct solution could be implemented:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
t.sort()  # Sort the subtasks by their time
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * sum(t)
        
        if time_used > M:
            break
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        subtasks_solved = 0
        subtask_index = 0
        
        while remaining_time > 0 and subtask_index < k:
            subtask_time = t[subtask_index]
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = (n - complete_tasks) * k
                subtasks_solved_for_this_subtask = min(max_subtasks_for_this_task, remaining_time // subtask_time)
                subtasks_solved += subtasks_solved_for_this_subtask
                remaining_time -= subtasks_solved_for_this_subtask * subtask_time
            subtask_index += 1
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    
    return max_points
```
In this corrected version, we first sort the subtasks by their time. Then, for each possible number of complete tasks, we calculate the remaining time and try to solve as many subtasks as possible with that time. We start with the subtask that takes the least time and try to solve as many instances of that subtask as possible, then move on to the next subtask, and so on. This way, we ensure that we are solving the maximum number of subtasks with the available time.
