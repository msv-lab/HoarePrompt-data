The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement that it is directly inside. Since there is no specific loop or conditional statement mentioned in the given code snippet, we will consider the general effect of the `break` statement.

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional statement that we were directly inside. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the new `complete_tasks` and `subtasks_solved` is updated based on the new `complete_tasks`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
