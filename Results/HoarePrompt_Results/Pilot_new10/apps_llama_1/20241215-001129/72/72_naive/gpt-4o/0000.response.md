Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It accurately calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions a pupil can be asked, as well as the number of questions Sergei is asked. 

The key to the solution is the concept of "full cycles" of questioning, where the teacher asks each row of pupils in a specific order. The program calculates the number of full cycles, the remaining questions after the full cycles, and uses these values to determine the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's questions.

The code handles edge cases such as when there is only one row, and it correctly updates the questions asked for each pupil based on the remaining questions after the full cycles.

The code also correctly handles Sergei's questions by checking if he is in the first or last row and calculating his questions accordingly.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Overall, the program seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description, and I couldn't find any potential cases where it does not work as expected.
