Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

*   The program correctly handles the case when there is only one row in the class. In this scenario, the teacher always asks children from this row, and the program accurately calculates the number of questions asked to each pupil.
*   For multiple rows, the program correctly calculates the length of a full cycle (i.e., the number of questions asked before the direction of the poll changes). It also accurately calculates the number of full cycles completed and the remaining questions.
*   The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum number of questions asked to any pupil. It considers the number of full cycles and the remaining questions to determine these values.
*   The program also accurately calculates the number of times the teacher asked Sergei. It takes into account the row and column where Sergei is seated and the remaining questions to determine this value.
*   The program's logic is sound, and it handles all edge cases correctly, including the scenario when Sergei is seated in the first or last row.

After analyzing the program and considering various test cases, it appears to be correct and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.
