Correctness: **True**

The program seems to be correctly calculating the maximum and minimum number of questions asked to pupils and the number of times Sergei is asked.

The key to understanding the program lies in the way it calculates `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. 

- `max_asked` is calculated by `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. This makes sense because the maximum number of questions a pupil is asked is achieved when the teacher asks all pupils in the first row, then all pupils in the last row, and so on. Since the teacher asks `k` questions, we divide `k` by the total number of rows (`2 * n`) and add `n - 1` to ensure that we're counting the maximum number of questions asked in the first row.

- `min_asked` is calculated by `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`. This ensures that even if `max_asked` is less than `n`, `min_asked` will still be at least 1, because the teacher must ask at least one question to each pupil.

- `sergei_asked` is calculated by `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`. This formula first calculates the number of times the teacher asks Sergei when moving in the forward direction, and then adds 1 if the teacher asks Sergei when moving in the backward direction.

The examples provided also validate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example, the teacher asks Sergei and the other two pupils in the first row 3 times, and asks Sergei 3 times. In the second example, the teacher asks Sergei only once, and the pupils in the first row twice, which aligns with the program's output.

Overall, based on the provided problem description and examples, the program appears to be correct and accurately calculates the required values.
