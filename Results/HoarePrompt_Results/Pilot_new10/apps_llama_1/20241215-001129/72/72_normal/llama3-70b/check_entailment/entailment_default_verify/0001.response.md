The original assessment seems to be mostly accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions asked to pupils and the number of times Sergei is asked. The formulas used in the program align with the problem description, and the examples provided validate the correctness of the program.

However, the output hints suggest that the program does not enforce any explicit constraints on the input values. This could potentially lead to incorrect results if the input values are not within the expected range. But since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

One potential issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where `n` is 1 separately. In this case, the teacher always asks children from the only row, and the formulas used in the program may not produce the correct results. However, the program seems to handle this case correctly, as evidenced by the first example provided.

Overall, based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints, the program appears to be correct and accurately calculates the required values.

Final: **True**
