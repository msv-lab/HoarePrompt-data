The value of `max_questions` is decreased by 1. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `col`, `row`, `x`, `y`, and `sergei_questions` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
