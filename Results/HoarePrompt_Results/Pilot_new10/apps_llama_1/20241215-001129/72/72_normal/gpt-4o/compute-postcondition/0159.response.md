Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is `y + 1` and must be less than `m`. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `x - 3` and `direction` is -1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as in the precondition, with `row` being `x + direction`.**
