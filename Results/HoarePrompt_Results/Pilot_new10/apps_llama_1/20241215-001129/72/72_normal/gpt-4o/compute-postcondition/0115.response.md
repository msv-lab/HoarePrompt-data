Postcondition: ***`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` equals -1, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `direction` is 1, `row` is `x + direction`, and if `row` equals `x + direction`, then the condition to increase `sergei_questions` is updated.***
