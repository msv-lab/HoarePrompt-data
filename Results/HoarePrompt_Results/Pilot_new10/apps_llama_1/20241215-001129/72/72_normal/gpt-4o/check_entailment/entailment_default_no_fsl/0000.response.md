Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. One such case is when `k` is less than `m` and `n` is greater than 1. In this scenario, the code does not correctly calculate the number of questions asked to Sergei, the minimum number of questions asked, and the maximum number of questions asked.

For example, if `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `k = 5`, `x = 2`, and `y = 1`, the output of the code is incorrect. In this case, the correct output should be `2 1 1`, but the code produces a different result.

Another case where the code fails is when `n` is 1 and `k` is not a multiple of `m`. In this case, the code does not correctly calculate the number of questions asked to Sergei.

Additionally, the code assumes that `x` and `y` are always within the valid range, but it does not explicitly check for this. If `x` or `y` is out of range, the code may produce incorrect results.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle these edge cases and ensure that `x` and `y` are within the valid range. 

Also, in the given code, `min_questions` and `max_questions` are not updated correctly when `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`. 

Lastly, `sergei_questions` is not correctly calculated when `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. 

The given code needs significant modifications to handle all potential cases correctly.
