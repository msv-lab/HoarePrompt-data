The value of `row` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `row` was -1, so the new value of `row` is -1 + 2 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `row` is 1, `col` is 0, `direction` is 1, and the previous values of `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `remaining_questions`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` are unchanged from their previous values before entering this condition, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value**
