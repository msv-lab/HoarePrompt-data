Postcondition: ***`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `col` equals `y + 2`, `m` is greater than `y + 2` and `m` is greater than `col`, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` equals `x - 3`, `direction` is `-1`, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1, otherwise `row` equals `x + direction`, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1***
