Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is decreased by 3 and `direction` equals -1. In all cases, if `row + direction - 1` equals `x` (or `row - 4` if `row` equals `n`) and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `row` is increased by `direction`.**
