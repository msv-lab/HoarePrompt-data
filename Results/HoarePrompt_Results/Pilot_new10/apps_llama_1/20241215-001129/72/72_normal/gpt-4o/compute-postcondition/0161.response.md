The value of `row` is increased by `direction`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1 and must be less than `m`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by `direction`, and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1 and must be less than `m`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is `row + direction`, and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
