The function `func` does not accept any parameters. 

However, based on the parameter constraints provided: 
n, m, k, x, and y are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, 1 <= k <= 10^18, 1 <= x <= n, and 1 <= y <= m.

Since no information is given about the output, we can only describe the expected input parameters based on the given constraints. 

The functionality of the function func is to potentially use the integers n, m, k, x, and y, where n and m are between 1 and 100, k is between 1 and 10^18, and x and y are bounded by n and m respectively.

Functionality: **The function uses integers n, m, k, x, and y, where 1 <= n, m <= 100, 1 <= k <= 10^18, 1 <= x <= n, and 1 <= y <= m.**
