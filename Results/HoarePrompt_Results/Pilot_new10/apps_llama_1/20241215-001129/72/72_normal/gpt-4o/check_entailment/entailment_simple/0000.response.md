Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for several reasons:

1.  The program does not accurately calculate the maximum and minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked. It attempts to calculate these values based on the number of full cycles and remaining questions, but it does not properly account for the distribution of questions among pupils in the class.

2.  The program does not accurately calculate the number of times the teacher asks Sergei. It attempts to calculate this value based on the number of full cycles and remaining questions, but it does not properly account for the position of Sergei in the class and the direction of the teacher's questioning.

3.  The program has a bug in the loop where it updates the `max_questions` variable. The `max_questions` variable is incremented or decremented based on the direction of the teacher's questioning, but it is not properly reset after each full cycle. This will cause `max_questions` to be incorrect if the number of remaining questions is greater than 0.

4.  The program does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly. In this case, the teacher always asks children from the same row, but the program does not properly account for this in its calculations.

5.  The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `m` correctly. In this case, the teacher does not have a chance to ask all pupils in the class, but the program does not properly account for this in its calculations.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be rewritten to properly account for the distribution of questions among pupils in the class, the position of Sergei, and the direction of the teacher's questioning. The program also needs to handle the special cases where `n` is 1 and `k` is less than `m` correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    if n == 1:
        max_questions = k // m + (k % m > 0)
        min_questions = k // m
        sergei_questions = (k - 1) // m + 1 if y == (k - 1) % m else k // m
    else:
        full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m
        full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
        remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
        max_questions = full_cycles + (remaining_questions // m + (remaining_questions % m > 0))
        min_questions = full_cycles
        sergei_questions = full_cycles
        row = 0
        direction = 1
        for _ in range(remaining_questions):
            if row == x and _ % m == y:
                sergei_questions += 1
            row += direction
            if row == n:
                direction = -1
                row -= 2
            elif row == -1:
                direction = 1
                row += 2
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)
```

This corrected version properly accounts for the distribution of questions among pupils in the class, the position of Sergei, and the direction of the teacher's questioning. It also handles the special cases where `n` is 1 and `k` is less than `m` correctly.
