Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 1, if `row` equals -1, then `row` equals `row + 3`, `direction` is 1, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value based on the updates from the previous iteration, `x`, and `y` have values based on the updates from the previous iteration.**
