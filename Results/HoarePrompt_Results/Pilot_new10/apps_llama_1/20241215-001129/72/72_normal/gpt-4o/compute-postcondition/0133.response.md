Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0. The current value of `row` is -1. If in the past, `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then the current values of `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are one less than their previous values, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, otherwise the current values of `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `remaining_questions`, and `sergei_questions` are unchanged from their previous values before entering this condition. The current value of `max_questions` is one less than its previous value. The current value of `col` is 0, and the direction is not equal to 1.**
