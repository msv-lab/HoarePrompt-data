Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 0, initially `row` equals `x + 1`, but the current value of `row` is equal to `n`, the current value of `direction` is 1, `max_questions` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, `sergei_questions` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and the current state of `x`, `y`, `max_questions`, and `sergei_questions` reflects the updates based on the loop body**
