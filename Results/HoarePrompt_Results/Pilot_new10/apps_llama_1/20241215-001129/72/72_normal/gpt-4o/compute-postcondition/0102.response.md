Postcondition: ***`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 1. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3` and `direction` equals -1; otherwise, `row` and `direction` retain their previous values relative to the condition. `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the updated `row` and the current `col` match `x` and `y`, or if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` after updating `row`. If `direction` does not equal 1, then if `row` equals -1, `row` equals `row + 3`, `direction` is 1, and `max_questions` is one less than its previous value based on the updates from the previous iteration.***
