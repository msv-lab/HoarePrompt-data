The value of `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `sergei_questions` is unknown, so the new value is `sergei_questions + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_n`, `m` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_m`, `k` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_k`, `col` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
