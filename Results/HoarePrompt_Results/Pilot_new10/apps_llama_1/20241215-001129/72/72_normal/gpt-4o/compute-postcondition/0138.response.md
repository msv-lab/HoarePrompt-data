According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m` and `col`. If `col` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `col` is not specified, but for the loop to execute again, `col` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1**
