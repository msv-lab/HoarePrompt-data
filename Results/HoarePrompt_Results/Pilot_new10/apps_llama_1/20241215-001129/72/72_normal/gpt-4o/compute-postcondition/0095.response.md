The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 1, `row` is `row + (-1) - 2` which simplifies to `row - 3`, `direction` equals -1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `x` has its previous value, `y` has its previous value, if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 1, `row` is `row - 3`, `direction` equals -1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `x` has its previous value, `y` has its previous value, if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
