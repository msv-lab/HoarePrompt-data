Postcondition: ***`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 2. If `direction` is 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` is updated to `x - 3` and `direction` is -1; otherwise, `row` and `direction` remain unchanged. `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` are increased by 1 if `row + direction` equals `x`. If `direction` is not 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is not -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is updated to `x + direction`, and the condition to increase `sergei_questions` is updated if `row` equals `x + direction`.***
