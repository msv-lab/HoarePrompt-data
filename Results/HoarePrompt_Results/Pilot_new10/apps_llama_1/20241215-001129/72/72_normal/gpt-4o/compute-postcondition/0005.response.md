To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `full_cycles`, with specific conditions for calculating `full_cycles` based on the value of `n`. 

The code snippet calculates `remaining_questions` as the remainder of `k` divided by `full_cycle_length`. However, `full_cycle_length` is not directly defined in the provided initial state or code snippet. Given the context, it seems `full_cycle_length` should be equivalent to the denominator used in calculating `full_cycles`, which is `(2 * input_n - 2) * input_m` if `input_n > 1`, otherwise it's `input_m`.

Let's denote `full_cycle_length` as `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1`, otherwise `m`, based on the initial state's definition of `full_cycles`.

Thus, `remaining_questions = k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `remaining_questions = k % m`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` = `input_n`
- `m` = `input_m`
- `k` = `input_k`
- `x` = `input_x` - 1
- `y` = `input_y` - 1
- `full_cycles` equals `input_k // ((2 * input_n - 2) * input_m)` if `input_n` > 1, otherwise `full_cycles` equals `input_k // input_m`

After executing the code:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `full_cycles` remain unchanged since the code only introduces a new variable `remaining_questions` without modifying these.
- `remaining_questions` is now defined as `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `k % m`.

Therefore, the output state includes all initial variables with their conditions and the new variable `remaining_questions`:

Output State: **`n` = `input_n`, `m` = `input_m`, `k` = `input_k`, `x` = `input_x` - 1, `y` = `input_y` - 1, `full_cycles` equals `input_k // ((2 * input_n - 2) * input_m)` if `input_n` > 1, otherwise `full_cycles` equals `input_k // input_m`, and `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `k % m`.**
