The value of `direction` is set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, except for `row` which is now `row + 1` since `direction` is 1. If `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `direction` equals 1, `row` equals `row + 1`, if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
