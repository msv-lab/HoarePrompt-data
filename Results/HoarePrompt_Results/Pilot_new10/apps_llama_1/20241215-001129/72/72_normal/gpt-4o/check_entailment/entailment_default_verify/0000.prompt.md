You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 


-----Examples-----

Output

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if n > 1:
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)
    else:
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)
    row = 0
    direction = 1
    for _ in range(remaining_questions):
        for col in range(m):
            if row == x and col == y:
                sergei_questions += 1
            if direction == 1:
                max_questions += 1
                row += direction
                if row == n:
                    direction = -1
                    row -= 2
            else:
                max_questions -= 1
                row += direction
                if row == -1:
                    direction = 1
                    row += 2
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It accurately calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions a pupil can be asked, as well as the number of questions Sergei is asked. 

The key to the solution is the concept of "full cycles" of questioning, where the teacher asks each row of pupils in a specific order. The program calculates the number of full cycles, the remaining questions after the full cycles, and uses these values to determine the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's questions.

The code handles edge cases such as when there is only one row, and it correctly updates the questions asked for each pupil based on the remaining questions after the full cycles.

The code also correctly handles Sergei's questions by checking if he is in the first or last row and calculating his questions accordingly.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Overall, the program seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description, and I couldn't find any potential cases where it does not work as expected.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` as input, calculates the number of questions that will be asked to Sergei, the minimum number of questions that can be asked, and the maximum number of questions that can be asked, and prints these values, handling edge cases such as when `n` is 1, and implicitly handling cases such as when `k` is 0, or when `x` or `y` is out of range, but without explicitly checking for invalid input values. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
