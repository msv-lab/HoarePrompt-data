The value of `direction` is set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `row` is still dependent on `x` and `direction`, so now `row` equals `x + 1`. 

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `col` equals `y + 2`, `m` is greater than `y + 2` and `m` is greater than `col`, `direction` equals 1, `row` equals `x + 1`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its original value**
