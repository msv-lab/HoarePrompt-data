The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` as input, calculates the number of questions that will be asked to Sergei, the minimum number of questions that can be asked, and the maximum number of questions that can be asked, and prints these values, handling edge cases such as when `n` is 1, and implicitly handling cases such as when `k` is 0, or when `x` or `y` is out of range, but without explicitly checking for invalid input values.
