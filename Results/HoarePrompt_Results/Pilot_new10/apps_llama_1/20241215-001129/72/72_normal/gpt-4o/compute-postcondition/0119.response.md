To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state before the loop starts:
- `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0
- `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0
- `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0
- `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, and `remaining_questions` have specific values but are one less than their previous values, suggesting they are being updated in a sequence.
- `col` is reset as it iterates over the range of `m`.
- `row` and `direction` are updated based on the loop's boundary conditions.
- `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` are updated based on the loop's iterations and boundary conditions.

The loop statement is:
```python
for col in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1 because `range(m)` generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `m`. If `m` were 0, the loop would not execute at all.

At the start of the loop, `col` should be 0, as that is the first value generated by `range(m)`.

Considering the dependency on `m` for the loop to start executing, and knowing `col` starts at 0, we adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are one less than their previous values, `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` are updated based on the loop's iterations and boundary conditions, `row` and `direction` are updated based on the loop's boundary conditions, `col` is 0**
