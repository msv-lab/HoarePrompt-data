The value of `direction` is updated to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_n`. The value of `m` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_m`. The value of `k` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_k`. The value of `col` is still `y + 1` and must be less than `m`. The value of `row` is updated to `x + (-1)` or `x - 1`, since `direction` is now -1. If `x - 1` equals `x` and `y + 1` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1. However, `x - 1` cannot equal `x`, so `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` are not increased. 

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is `y + 1` and must be less than `m`, `row` is `x - 1`, `direction` is -1**
