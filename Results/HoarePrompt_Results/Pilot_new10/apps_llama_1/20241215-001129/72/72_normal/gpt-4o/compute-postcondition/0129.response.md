Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `remaining_questions`, and `sergei_questions` are determined by whether `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `max_questions` is one more than its previous value, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` equals `n - 2`, `col` is 0, and `direction` is -1, otherwise `row` is `row + 1` and `col` is 0.**
