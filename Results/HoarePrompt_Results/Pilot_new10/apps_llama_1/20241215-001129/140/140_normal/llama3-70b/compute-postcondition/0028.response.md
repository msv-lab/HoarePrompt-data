The function `func_1` accepts parameters `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`, representing a vertex in a directed graph, the graph's adjacency list, a list of visited vertices, and a recursion stack, respectively. 

Looking at the code, it appears to be implementing a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. The function marks the current node as visited and adds it to the recursion stack. It then recursively checks all neighboring nodes. If a neighboring node is not visited, the function calls itself with that node. If the neighboring node is visited and already in the recursion stack, it means a cycle is detected, and the function returns `True`.

However, the function does not handle the case where the input graph is empty or the node is not present in the graph. Additionally, the function does not check for invalid inputs, such as a node that is not an integer or a graph that is not a dictionary or list.

The function returns `True` if a cycle is detected in the graph, and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a node and a directed graph, performs a depth-first search to detect cycles, and returns True if a cycle is found, False otherwise, assuming the input graph is valid and the node exists in the graph. **
