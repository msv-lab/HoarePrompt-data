According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph` and the `node`. If `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in the graph, `visited[node]` is `True`, and `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. For the loop to execute again, `graph[node]` must have at least 2 neighbors and `neighbor` must be the second neighbor of `node` in the graph.
State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph where `node` is a key and has at least 2 neighbors, `visited` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor of `node` in the graph**
