The value of `visited[node]` is set to `True`, indicating that the vertex represented by `node` has been visited. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph, `visited` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `visited[node]` is `True` and the values of other vertices remain unchanged, and `rec_stack` is a list or dictionary of boolean values representing whether each vertex is in the recursion stack.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph, `visited` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `visited[node]` is `True`, and `rec_stack` is a list or dictionary of boolean values representing whether each vertex is in the recursion stack**
