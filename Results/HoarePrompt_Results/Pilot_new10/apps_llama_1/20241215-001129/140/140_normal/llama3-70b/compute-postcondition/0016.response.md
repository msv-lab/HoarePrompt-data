Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph where `node` is a key and has at least 2 neighbors, `visited` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor of `node` in the graph. If the second neighbor of `node` is in the recursion stack, the program returns True. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this scenario.***
