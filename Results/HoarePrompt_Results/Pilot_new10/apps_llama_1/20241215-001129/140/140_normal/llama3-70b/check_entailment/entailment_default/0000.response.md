Correctness: **False**

The code provided attempts to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, it only checks if the original graph contains a cycle or not. If the graph contains a cycle, it prints 'NO', indicating that removing one edge cannot make the graph acyclic. But, it does not consider the possibility of removing an edge to break the cycle.

In the case where the graph contains a cycle and removing one edge can indeed make the graph acyclic, the code will still print 'NO'. This is because the code only checks for the presence of a cycle in the original graph and does not attempt to find an edge that can be removed to break the cycle.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should perform a depth-first search to detect cycles and then check if removing any edge can break the cycle, making the graph acyclic. The provided code does not implement this step, making it incorrect for the given problem description. 

Here's an example case where the code fails: consider a graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges (1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1). This graph contains a cycle (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1). The code will print 'NO', indicating that removing one edge cannot make the graph acyclic. However, removing any of the edges (e.g., edge 2 -> 3) will indeed make the graph acyclic. Therefore, the code should print 'YES' for this case, but it prints 'NO', demonstrating its incorrectness.
