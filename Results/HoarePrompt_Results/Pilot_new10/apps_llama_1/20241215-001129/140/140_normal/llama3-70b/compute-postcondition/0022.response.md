Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph where `node` is a key and has at least 3 neighbors, `visited` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If the third neighbor of `node` is in the recursion stack, the program returns True. If there is no else part, the program state remains unchanged except when the condition of the if part is met, resulting in the program returning True.***
