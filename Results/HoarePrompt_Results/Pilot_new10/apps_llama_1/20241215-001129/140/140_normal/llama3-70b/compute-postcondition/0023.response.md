Postcondition: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph where `node` is a key and has at least 3 neighbors, `visited` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list or dictionary of boolean values where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and `neighbor` is the third neighbor of `node` in the graph. If `visited[neighbor]` is `False` and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True`, the program returns `True`. If `visited[neighbor]` is `True`, the program returns `True` if the third neighbor of `node` is in the recursion stack, otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.**
