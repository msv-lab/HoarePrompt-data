The code initializes a dictionary `in_degree` with keys ranging from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and assigns each key an initial value of 0. This dictionary is used to store the in-degree of each node in the graph.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a node (integer), the value for each key is a list of its neighboring nodes (integers), `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph such that 1 <= `n` <= 500, and `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node (integer) from 1 to `n` and each value is 0**
