Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least one neighbor, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the new last removed element of the `queue`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated based on the graph structure, and `queue` has one less element than before. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 and `queue` is not empty and contains `neighbor` as its last element. Otherwise, the state of `in_degree[neighbor]` and `queue` remains as initially updated after removing `node` from `queue`.***
