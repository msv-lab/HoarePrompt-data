The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. The previous state of the `queue` had one less element than before and may or may not have been empty. With the addition of `neighbor`, the `queue` now has at least one element. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least one neighbor, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the new last removed element, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated based on the graph structure with `in_degree[neighbor]` = 0, and `queue` is not empty and contains `neighbor` as its last element.**
