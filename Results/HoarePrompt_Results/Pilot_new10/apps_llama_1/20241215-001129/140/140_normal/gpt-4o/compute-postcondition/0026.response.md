The code creates a queue and initializes it with nodes from the `in_degree` dictionary where the in-degree of the node is 0. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph, `queue` is a deque containing all nodes with an in-degree of 0**
