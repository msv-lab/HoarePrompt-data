The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` node to the end of the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` has at least one key with a value that could be 0 after the decrement operation, `queue` is one node shorter, `count` is 1, `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue` and is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0. 

The states of the variables `graph`, `n`, `in_degree`, `count`, and `node` are not affected by this operation. However, the state of `queue` is modified as `neighbor` is added to it, making it one node longer than it was before this operation, and thus it is no longer one node shorter than its initial state before the removal of `node`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` has at least one key with a value that could be 0 after the decrement operation, `queue` contains `neighbor` in addition to its previous nodes, excluding the leftmost node that was removed, `count` is 1, `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue` and is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.
Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` has at least one key with a value that could be 0 after the decrement operation, `queue` contains `neighbor` in addition to its previous nodes, excluding the leftmost node that was removed, `count` is 1, `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue` and is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0**
