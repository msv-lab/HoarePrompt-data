Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least two neighbors, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the new last removed element of the `queue`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` = `in_degree[neighbor]` - 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `queue` has the same number of elements as before with `neighbor` as the new last element. Otherwise, `queue` has one less element than before.***
