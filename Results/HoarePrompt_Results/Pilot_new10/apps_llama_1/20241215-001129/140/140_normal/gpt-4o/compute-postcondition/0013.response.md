The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. `graph` is still a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one unprocessed node, `n` is still a positive integer, `in_degree` is still a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph, `u` is still a key in `graph` with at least two neighbors, `v` is still the second neighbor of `u` in `graph`, and `in_degree[v]` now holds the updated in-degree value.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one unprocessed node, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value represents the total in-degree of the node in the graph, `u` is a key in `graph` with at least two neighbors, `v` is the second neighbor of `u` in `graph`, `in_degree[v]` is the previous in-degree of `v` plus 1**.
