Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least one neighbor, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the next neighbor in the `graph` of the previous `node`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated, specifically `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` is updated to `queue + [neighbor]`.***
