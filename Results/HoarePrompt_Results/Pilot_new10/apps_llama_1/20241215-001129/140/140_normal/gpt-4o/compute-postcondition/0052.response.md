Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the previously removed leftmost element of the `queue`, `count` is 2, and `graph[node]` is not empty. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 for a `neighbor` in `graph[node]`, then `queue` is not empty and contains `neighbor`. Otherwise, the state of `queue` and `in_degree[neighbor]` remains as per the precondition, with `in_degree[neighbor]` being greater than 0 for the considered `neighbor`.***
