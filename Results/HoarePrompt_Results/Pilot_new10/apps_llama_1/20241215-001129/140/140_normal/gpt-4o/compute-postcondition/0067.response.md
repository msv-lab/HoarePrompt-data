Postcondition: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least one neighbor, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the new last removed element of the `queue`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated based on the graph structure with `in_degree[neighbor]` = `in_degree[neighbor]` - 1, and `queue` has one less element than before and may or may not be empty. The current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0**
