Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem described. It checks if a given directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The function `func_1` iterates through each edge in the graph and checks if removing that edge results in a cycle-free graph. If it finds such an edge, it immediately returns 'YES'. If it checks all edges and can't find one that, when removed, results in a cycle-free graph, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function checks if a graph contains a cycle by using the Topological Sort algorithm. If a graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), then a topological sort of the graph is possible. The function calculates the in-degree of each node (the number of edges that arrive at that node), then it uses a queue to process the nodes with an in-degree of 0. As each node is processed, its in-degree and the in-degrees of its neighbors are updated. If at the end of the process, all nodes have been processed (i.e., the count of processed nodes is equal to the total number of nodes), then the graph is a DAG and does not contain a cycle. Otherwise, it does.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including graphs that are already acyclic, graphs that can be made acyclic by removing one edge, and graphs that cannot be made acyclic by removing one edge. 

The output hints for both functions agree with the code and demonstrate the correct functionality. The examples provided also illustrate cases where the code behaves as expected according to the problem description. 

Therefore, based on the code and output hints provided, the program behaves correctly for all potential cases and should return the expected output for any given input that adheres to the problem description.
