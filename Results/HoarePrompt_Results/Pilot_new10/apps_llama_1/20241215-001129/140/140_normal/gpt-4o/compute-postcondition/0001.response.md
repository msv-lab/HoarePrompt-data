To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement and the initial state.

The loop statement is `for u in graph:`, which means it will iterate over each key in the `graph` dictionary. For this loop to execute, the `graph` dictionary must not be empty, and it should contain at least one key (node) to iterate over.

Given the initial state:
- `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, such that 1 <= `n` <= 500.
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node (integer) from 1 to `n` and each value is 0.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:
1. `graph` is not empty and contains at least one node.
2. Since `u` will take the value of each key in `graph` during each iteration, we can say `u` will be the first node in `graph` at the start of the loop.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must have at least one node, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and each value is 0, `u` is the first node in `graph`**
