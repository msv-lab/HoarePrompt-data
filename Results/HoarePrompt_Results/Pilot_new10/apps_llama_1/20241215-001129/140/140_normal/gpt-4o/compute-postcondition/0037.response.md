The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. Given that `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, if the new value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `neighbor` is added to `queue`; otherwise, the length of `queue` remains the same as before the decrement operation but a node was removed before this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected, except for `in_degree[neighbor]` which has been decremented. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` has at least one key with a value that could be 0 after the decrement operation, `count` is 1, `node` is the same as before, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, and if new `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` contains `neighbor` in addition to its previous nodes, excluding the leftmost node that was removed; otherwise, `queue` is the same length as before the decrement operation but with a node removed before the operation**
