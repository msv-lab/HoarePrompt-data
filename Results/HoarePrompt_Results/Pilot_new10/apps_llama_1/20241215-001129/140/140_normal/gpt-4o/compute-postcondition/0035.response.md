Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` has at least one key with a value that could be 0 after the decrement operation, `count` is 1, `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue` and is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` contains `neighbor` in addition to its previous nodes, excluding the leftmost node that was removed; otherwise, `queue` is one node shorter.***
