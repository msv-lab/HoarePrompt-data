The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds a new element `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. The `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the new last removed element of the `queue`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated, and initially, `queue` has one less element than before.

Since `queue` had one less element than before, now it has the same number of elements as before, because a new element `neighbor` was added.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least two neighbors, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the new last removed element of the `queue`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` = `in_degree[neighbor]` - 1, and `queue` has the same number of elements as before, with `neighbor` as the new last element.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must contain `node` as a key with at least two neighbors, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the new last removed element of the `queue`, `count` is 3, `in_degree` values are updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` = `in_degree[neighbor]` - 1, and `queue` has the same number of elements as before, with `neighbor` as the new last element.**
