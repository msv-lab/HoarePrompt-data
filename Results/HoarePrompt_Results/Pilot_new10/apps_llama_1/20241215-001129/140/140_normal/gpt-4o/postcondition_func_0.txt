The function accepts parameters `n` (number of vertices), `m` (number of edges), and `edges` (list of directed edges), and returns 'YES' if the graph is cycle-free or if removing any single edge makes it cycle-free; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating the presence of a cycle that cannot be removed by deleting a single edge.
