Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `count` is 1, `node` is the same as before, `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in the `graph`, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` contains the `neighbor` node***
