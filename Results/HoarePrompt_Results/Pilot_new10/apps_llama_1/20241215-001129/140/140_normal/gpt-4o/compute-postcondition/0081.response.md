The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary representing a directed graph. The graph dictionary has integer keys representing nodes, and each key's value is a list of neighboring integer nodes. Additionally, the function implicitly relies on the parameter `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), representing the number of nodes in the graph. After executing the function body, the function returns `True` if there are nodes in the graph that are not reachable from nodes with an in-degree of 0, and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a graph represented as a dictionary and the number of nodes, returns `True` if there are nodes not reachable from nodes with an in-degree of 0, and `False` otherwise.**
