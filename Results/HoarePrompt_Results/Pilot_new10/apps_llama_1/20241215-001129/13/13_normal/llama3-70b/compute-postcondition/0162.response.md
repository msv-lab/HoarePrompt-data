The function `func` accepts two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters. It calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters (representing golden trophies) before an 'S' (representing a silver trophy) in the string, and also considers the maximum beauty score that can be achieved by swapping one 'G' with an 'S' if such a swap is possible. The function then prints the maximum of these two calculated beauty scores.

The function handles strings of length between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and does not perform any explicit validation on the input string `s` regarding its contents, assuming it will only contain 'G' and 'S' characters as per the annotations. However, the actual code does not explicitly check for or handle cases where the input string might contain characters other than 'G' or 'S', which could lead to incorrect results in such scenarios. 

Additionally, the function's logic does not account for cases where the optimal swap might not necessarily involve swapping a 'G' followed by an 'S' but could potentially involve other configurations that result in a higher count of consecutive 'G's, although the provided logic does consider a specific case of swapping which aims to maximize the consecutive 'G's by looking at 'G' followed by 'S' scenarios.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer n and a string s of length n, calculates the maximum consecutive 'G' characters before an 'S' and the maximum beauty score achievable by swapping one 'G' with an 'S' if a 'G' is followed by an 'S', then prints the maximum of these two scores, assuming the input string only contains 'G' and 'S' characters. **
