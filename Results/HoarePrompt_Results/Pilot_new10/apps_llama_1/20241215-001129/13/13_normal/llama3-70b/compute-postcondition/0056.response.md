To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(n - 1):`, which means the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters,
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`,
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`,
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character,
- `right` equals `n`, and
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`.

The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which is guaranteed since `n` is between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). This condition is always met given the constraints on `n`.

For the loop to start executing, `i` needs to be defined and set to the initial value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, and `i` is 0**
