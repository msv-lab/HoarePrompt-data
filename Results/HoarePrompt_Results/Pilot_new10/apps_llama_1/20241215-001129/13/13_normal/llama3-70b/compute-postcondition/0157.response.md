The given code `max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)` updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `beauty`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n`, `j` is `n`, and `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards, or 1 if the loop did not execute**
