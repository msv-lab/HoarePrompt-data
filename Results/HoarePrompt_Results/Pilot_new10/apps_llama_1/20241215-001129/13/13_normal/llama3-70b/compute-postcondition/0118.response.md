According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 3`, `n` is greater than `i + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `i + 4`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i + 4`, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`, if `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop.**
