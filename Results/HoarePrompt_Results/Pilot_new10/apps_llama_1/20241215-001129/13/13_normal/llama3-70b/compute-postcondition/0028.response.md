The code increments the value of `left` by 1. The previous value of `left` was less than `right` and pointed to an 'S' character in `s`. 

After incrementing `left` by 1, its new value is still less than or equal to `right` because `right` is the current index plus 1 and we only incremented `left` by 1. 

Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one 'S' character and 'G' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the current index plus 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is less than or equal to `right` and is `left + 1`.**
