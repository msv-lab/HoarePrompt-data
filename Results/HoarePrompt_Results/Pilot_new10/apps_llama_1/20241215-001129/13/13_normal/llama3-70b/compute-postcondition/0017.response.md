The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was 2, so the new value of `left` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters and `s[1]` is 'S' and `s[2]` is 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 3, `right` must be at least 3.
