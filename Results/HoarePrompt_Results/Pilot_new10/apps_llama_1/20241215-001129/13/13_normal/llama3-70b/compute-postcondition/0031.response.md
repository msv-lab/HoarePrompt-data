According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: `left` must be less than `right`, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'. 

At the end of the last iteration, `right` is greater than the new `left` index, which means the first condition is already met. 

For the second condition, since `left` is `left + 1`, it means the previous `left` index did not point to a 'G' character. However, this does not guarantee that the new `left` index will not point to a 'G' character. 

Since `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one 'S' character and 'G' characters, and `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, we need to ensure that the new `left` index is not in `golden` for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one 'S' character and 'G' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is greater than the new `left` index, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is `left + 1`, and the new `left` index is not in `golden`**
