To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `left < right and s[left]!= 'G'`.

1. **Condition 1: `left < right`** - For this condition to be true, `right` must be at least one more than `left`. Since `left` is 1 and `right` is at least 1, to ensure this condition holds true for another iteration, `right` needs to be at least 2 (because `left` will increment in the loop body, but we're focusing on the conditions before the next iteration starts).

2. **Condition 2: `s[left]!= 'G'`** - Given that `s[1]` is 'S', for the loop to continue, the character at the next `left` index must not be 'G'. Since `left` starts at 1 and `s[1]` is 'S', we need to ensure that the next character (at index 2, since indexing starts at 0) is not 'G' for the loop to potentially execute again. However, the condition of `s[left]!= 'G'` is directly dependent on the string `s` itself and how it's modified or interpreted in the loop body, which we don't have information about.

Given these considerations:

- `n` being an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) doesn't directly influence the loop condition as long as `n` is greater than 1 (to accommodate at least two characters in `s`, given `s[1]` is specified).
- `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, and `s[1]` is 'S'. For the loop to potentially execute again, the next character `s` accesses must not be 'G', but this is more about the string's content than a condition we can universally apply without knowing the loop body's effects.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, which might be relevant for understanding where 'G's are located, but isn't directly part of the loop condition.
- `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` being 0, and `left` being 1, `right` being at least 1, are states that need adjustment for the loop condition to potentially hold true for another iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute again, the necessary adjustment based on the given conditions is that `right` must be greater than `left` (which means `right` needs to be at least 2 if `left` is 1), and we cannot determine the exact nature of `s` without the loop body. However, since we're focusing on states that can allow the loop to proceed without assuming the loop body's effects, we stick to what's given and required for the loop conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters and s[1] is 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` must be at least 2**
