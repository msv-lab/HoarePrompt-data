Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap. The issue with the program is that it only checks for the possibility of swapping a 'G' with an adjacent 'S' to increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. However, the problem statement does not restrict the swap to be between adjacent trophies. 

For example, if the input is 8 and the string is "GGSGGSGS", the program will not find the optimal solution because the best swap would be between the first 'S' and the last 'S', resulting in a string "GGGGGSGS" with a maximum beauty of 5. However, the program does not consider this possibility and will incorrectly report a maximum beauty of 3.

The program should check all possible swaps, not just adjacent ones, to find the maximum beauty. 

Here is a correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)

    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'S':
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
                    curr_beauty = 0
                    for right in range(n):
                        if s[right] == 'G':
                            curr_beauty += 1
                        else:
                            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
                            curr_beauty = 0
                    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
                    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
    print(max_beauty)

func()
```
This program checks all possible swaps of a 'G' with an 'S' and updates the maximum beauty if a longer subsegment of golden trophies is found. It then prints the maximum beauty.
