To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i + 1`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`.
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `s[i]` is 'G'.
- `s[i + 1]` is 'S'.
- `j` is `i + 2`.
- If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is the initial value of `beauty` (1) plus the number of 'G' characters to the left of `s[i]` plus 1; otherwise, `beauty` is the initial value of `beauty` (1) plus the number of 'G' characters to the left of `s[i]`.

Loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, since the loop iterates over the range from `i + 2` to `n-1`. Given that `j` starts at `i + 2`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 3`.

Since `j` is now `i + 3`, we are looking at the next character in the string `s` after the previous `j`. All other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, `s[i]`, `s[i + 1]`) do not change because the loop only increments `j` and does not affect these variables directly based on the information given.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i + 1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i + 3`**
