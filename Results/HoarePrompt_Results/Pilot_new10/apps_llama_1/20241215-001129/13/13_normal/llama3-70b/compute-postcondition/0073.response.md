Based on the provided loop code and the output states after the first few iterations, we can analyze the changes in the variables and determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```
From the output states, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The loop iterates from `i - 1` to `-1` in reverse order.
2. If `s[j]` is 'G', the `beauty` variable is incremented by 1.
3. If `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop breaks, and the `beauty` variable is not incremented further.

Considering the initial state and the loop code, we can deduce the final output state:

* `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), as it is not modified within the loop.
* `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, as it is not modified within the loop.
* `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, as it is not modified within the loop.
* `max_beauty` remains the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, as it is not modified within this loop.
* `curr_beauty` remains either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, as it is not modified within this loop.
* `left` remains at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, as it is not modified within the loop.
* `right` remains equal to `n`, as it is not modified within the loop.
* `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
* `i` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
* `s[i]` remains 'G', and `s[i + 1]` remains 'S', as they are not modified within the loop.
* `j` will be `-1` after the loop finishes, as it iterates from `i - 1` to `-1`.
* `beauty` will be the initial value of `beauty` (which is 1) plus the number of 'G' characters to the left of `s[i]`. If there are no 'G' characters to the left of `s[i]`, `beauty` will remain 1.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `-1`, and `beauty` is the initial value of `beauty` (1) plus the number of 'G' characters to the left of `s[i]`.**
