To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```
The loop starts from `i - 1` and decrements `j` until it reaches `-1`. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is `'G'`, it increments `beauty` by 1. If the character is not `'G'`, it breaks out of the loop.

From the output states after the first few iterations, we can see that:

* If the loop executes at least once, `j` is `i - 1`, and `beauty` is either 2 (if the character at index `j` is `'G'`) or 1 (if the character is not `'G'`).
* If the loop executes at least twice, `j` is `i - 2`, and `beauty` is either 3 (if the character at index `j` is `'G'`) or 2 (if the character is not `'G'`).
* If the loop executes at least three times, `j` is `i - 3`, and `beauty` is either 4 (if the character at index `j` is `'G'`) or 3 (if the character is not `'G'`).

We can see a pattern emerging: `beauty` is incremented by 1 for each `'G'` character encountered, and the loop breaks out of the loop when a non-`'G'` character is encountered.

After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `j` will be `-1`, and `beauty` will be the total count of consecutive `'G'` characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `i` is less than or equal to 1), `beauty` will remain at its initial value of 1.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is -1, and `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards, or 1 if the loop does not execute.**
