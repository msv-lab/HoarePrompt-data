The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was strictly less than `n`, so the new value of `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The fact that `trophies[i-1]` must be 'G' and `trophies[i]` must be 'G' before the code is executed means that after the code is executed, `trophies[i-1]` will be the character that was `trophies[i]` before the code was executed (which is 'G'), and `trophies[i]` will be the next character in the `trophies` string, if `i` is still less than `n`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `trophies[i-2]` must be 'G', `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `i - 2`, and if `i` is less than `n`, `trophies[i-1]` must be 'G' and `trophies[i]` can be 'G' or 'S'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `trophies[i-2]` must be 'G', `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `i - 2`, and if `i` is less than `n`, `trophies[i-1]` must be 'G' and `trophies[i]` can be 'G' or 'S'**
