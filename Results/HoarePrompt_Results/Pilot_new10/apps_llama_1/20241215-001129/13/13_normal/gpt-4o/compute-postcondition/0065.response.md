Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 4 elements, `trophies` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 2`.***
