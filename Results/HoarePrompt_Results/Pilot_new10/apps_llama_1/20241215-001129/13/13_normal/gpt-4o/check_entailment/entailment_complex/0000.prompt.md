You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and trophies is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string, `n` remains the same as its original value, and `trophies` remains unchanged.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and is not empty, `n` remains the same as its original value, and `trophies` remains unchanged.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns max_length which is the length of the single sequence of 'G's in the trophies string, calculated as end - start + 1 for the single tuple in segments
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string, `segments` is not empty, `n` remains the same as its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `max_length` is equal to `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, and the number of elements in `segments` is more than 1
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `len(segments) - 1`, `n` is the original number of iterations, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string, `trophies` remains unchanged, and `max_length` is the maximum length of any sequence of 'G's including those separated by a single character.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of any sequence of 'G's (including those separated by a single character) plus one, and the original number of iterations `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', identifies sequences of 'G's, and returns 0 if no sequences are found, the length of a single sequence if only one exists, or the minimum value between the maximum length of any sequence of 'G's (including those separated by a single character) plus one and `n`, while potentially ignoring invalid inputs and edge cases not explicitly handled by the code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
