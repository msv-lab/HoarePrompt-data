The code appends a tuple to the `segments` list. The tuple contains the values of `start` and `i - 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `trophies` is unchanged, `start` is the initial value of `i`, `i` is either `n` or the index of the first 'S' encountered after `start`, and `segments` is updated with the tuple (`start`, `i - 1`).**
