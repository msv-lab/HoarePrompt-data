To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `i` is 3, 
- `n` is greater than 1, 
- `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 4 elements, 
- `trophies` remains unchanged, 
- `prev_start` is `segments[2][0]`, 
- `prev_end` is `segments[2][1]`, 
- `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, 
- `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`.

The code provided is:
```python
max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
```
Given that `max_length` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it exists and has some value. 

This line of code updates `max_length` to be the maximum between its current value and the expression `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `curr_end - curr_start + 1` is the length of the current sequence of 'G's.
- `prev_end - prev_start + 1` is the length of the previous sequence of 'G's.
- Adding these lengths together along with `1` gives the combined length of the two sequences with an additional character in between.

Therefore, `max_length` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and this combined length plus 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 4 elements, `trophies` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`, and `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 2`.**
