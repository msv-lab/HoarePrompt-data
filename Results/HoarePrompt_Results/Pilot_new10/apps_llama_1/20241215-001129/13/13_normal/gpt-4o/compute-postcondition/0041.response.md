Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `start` is the original value of `i`, `i` is the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` starting from `start` or `n` if no 'S' is found after `start`, and `segments` contains the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', then `i` is less than or equal to `n`.***
