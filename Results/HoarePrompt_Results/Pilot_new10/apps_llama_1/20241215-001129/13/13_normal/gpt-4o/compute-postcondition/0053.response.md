Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has more than 1 element, `trophies` remains unchanged, `max_length` is equal to `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, `prev_start` is the start of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` is the end of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`. The current value of `curr_start` is 2 more than the current value of `prev_end`.**
