To calculate the result, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. 

The initial state is: 
- `i` is 2, 
- `n` is greater than 1, 
- `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 3 elements, 
- `trophies` remains unchanged, 
- `prev_start` is the start of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, 
- `prev_end` is the end of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, 
- `curr_start` is the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`, 
- `curr_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`.

Now, let's analyze the impact of the given code on the program:
```python
max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
```
In this code, `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of the lengths of the current and previous sequences of 'G's plus 1.

Here, 
- `curr_end - curr_start + 1` gives the length of the current sequence of 'G's, 
- `prev_end - prev_start + 1` gives the length of the previous sequence of 'G's.

So, `max_length` becomes the maximum of its current value and the sum of these two lengths plus 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `i` is 2, 
- `n` is greater than 1, 
- `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 3 elements, 
- `trophies` remains unchanged, 
- `prev_start` is the start of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, 
- `prev_end` is the end of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, 
- `curr_start` is the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`, 
- `curr_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`, 
- `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 1 + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has at least 3 elements, `trophies` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is the start of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end of the sequence of 'G's at index 2 in `segments`, `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 1 + 1`.**
