Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description correctly because the function `func_1(x)` is being called before it is defined. In Python, the code is executed line by line, so when the `for` loop tries to call `func_1(n * m + 1)`, it raises a `NameError` because `func_1` has not been defined yet.

To fix this issue, the function definition should be moved above the `for` loop. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected and find a counterexample for any given `n`.
