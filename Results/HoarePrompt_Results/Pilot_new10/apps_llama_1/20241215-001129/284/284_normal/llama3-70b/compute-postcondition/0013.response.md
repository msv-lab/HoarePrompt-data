To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down what the loop does and how it affects the variables.

1. **Loop Purpose**: The loop checks if a number `num` is divisible by any integer `i` from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating `num` is not a prime number.

2. **Initial State**: `num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000, and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Iteration Effects**:
   - After the first iteration, `num` must be an odd number (not divisible by 2) within the range [4, 1000] because `i` starts at 2, and if `num` were even, it would be divisible by 2, and the function would return `False`.
   - After the second iteration, `num` must also not be divisible by 3, further restricting its possible values.
   - This pattern continues for each iteration up to `i` equaling the square root of `num`. For each `i`, `num` must not be divisible by `i` to continue through the loop without returning `False`.

4. **Final State**:
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means `num` is not divisible by any number from 2 up to its square root. This implies `num` is a prime number, as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - `i` will be the last value it was assigned in the loop, which is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1 - 1 = int(num ** 0.5)`, because the loop iterates up to but does not include the value `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - However, since the loop's purpose is to check for divisibility up to the square root of `num`, the final value of `i` primarily serves to indicate that the loop has checked all necessary values up to the square root of `num`.

Considering the initial state, the loop's behavior, and the conditions under which the loop will complete without returning `False`, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`num` is a prime number within the range [2, 1000], and `i` is equal to the square root of `num` (if `num` is a perfect square) or the largest integer less than the square root of `num` (if `num` is not a perfect square), indicating that `num` has been checked for divisibility up to its square root and found to be prime.**
