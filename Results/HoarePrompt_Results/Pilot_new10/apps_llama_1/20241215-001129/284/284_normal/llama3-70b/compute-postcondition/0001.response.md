Given that `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 1000, and the current value of `num` is less than 2, this implies `num` must be 1 since it's the only integer within the given range that satisfies the condition of being less than 2.

The code `return False` does not depend on the value of `num` or any other variable; it simply returns the boolean value `False`.

Output State: **The program returns False**
