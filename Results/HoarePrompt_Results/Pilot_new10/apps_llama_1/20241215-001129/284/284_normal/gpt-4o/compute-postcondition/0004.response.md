The given code simply returns `True`, which is a boolean value. The initial state of `x` does not affect the return value of the code because the code does not use `x` in any way. 

Given that `x` is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3, this means `x` can be either 2 or 3. However, as mentioned, the value of `x` does not influence the return value of the code.

Output State: **The program returns boolean value True**
