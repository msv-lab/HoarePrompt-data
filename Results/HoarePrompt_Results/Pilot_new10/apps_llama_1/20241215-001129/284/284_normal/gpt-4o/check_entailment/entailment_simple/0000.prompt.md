You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x):
    if (x <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1
    if (x <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns boolean value True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3
    if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x is greater than 1, x is greater than 3, and x is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3.
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is `35` (since it increments to this value right after the last valid iteration where `i` squared is less than or equal to `x`, considering the loop stops when `i` squared exceeds `x`), and `x` remains unchanged if it is not divisible by any of the primes less than or equal to the square root of `x`, meaning `x` is a prime number itself within the given range if it passes all the divisibility checks without returning `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the number `x` has passed all divisibility checks and is likely a prime number, with `i` being 35, which is the value it incremented to after the last valid iteration where `i` squared was less than or equal to `x`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
