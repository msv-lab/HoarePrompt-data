The input to the function is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees. `x` is assigned the value of this input. The input can be any integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), where positive values denote clockwise camera rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation. 

Output State: **The input to the function is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, `x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), where positive values of `x` denote clockwise camera rotation and negative values of `x` denote counter-clockwise rotation.**
