You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.

One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?

But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.

Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.

Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to "true up". [Image] 

The next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.


-----Examples-----
Input
60

Output
1

Input
-60

Output
3



-----Note-----

When the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.

From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program takes an integer input `x`, which represents the camera angle in degrees. Positive values denote clockwise camera rotation, and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation.

2. The program normalizes the input angle to a value within the range of 0 to 360 degrees using the modulus operator (`x % 360`).

3. The program then calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the "true up" direction. This is done by subtracting the normalized angle from 360 and then dividing by 90, taking the remainder when divided by 4. This approach ensures that the program considers all possible rotations and chooses the one that results in the smallest deviation.

The given examples support the correctness of the program:

- For an input of 60 degrees, the program outputs 1, which is correct because one 90-degree clockwise turn would result in a total rotation of 150 degrees, and the deviation from "true up" would be 150 degrees for one turn, which is not the smallest. However, considering the original problem and its examples, the smallest deviation is actually achieved by rotating the image 1 time (resulting in 150 degrees), but this is not the least deviation possible as per the problem statement and its examples, for instance, when the rotation is 60 counter-clockwise (input -60), three rotations are needed to achieve the smallest deviation, which matches the given output.

The key insight here is that the program is minimizing the deviation from the "true up" direction, which may not always be achieved by rotating the image in the same direction as the camera rotation. The program's approach of considering all possible rotations and choosing the one that results in the smallest deviation is correct.

While the initial analysis may raise questions about specific inputs, a closer examination of the problem and the program reveals that it correctly addresses the requirements outlined in the problem statement. Therefore, based on the provided information and examples, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads an integer input from the user representing a camera angle in degrees, normalizes the angle to be within the range of -360 to 360 degrees, calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to reach a specific position based on the normalized angle, and prints the result. However, the function does not handle negative input angles correctly, does not perform any error checking, and does not account for input values outside the range of -10^18 to 10^18. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
