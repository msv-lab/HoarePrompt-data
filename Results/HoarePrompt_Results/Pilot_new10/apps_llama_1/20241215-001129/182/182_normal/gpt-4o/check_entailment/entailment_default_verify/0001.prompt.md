You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.

One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?

But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.

Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.

Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to "true up". [Image] 

The next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.


-----Examples-----
Input
60

Output
1

Input
-60

Output
3



-----Note-----

When the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.

From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle negative input angles correctly. When a negative angle is input, it will be normalized to an equivalent positive angle between 0 and 360. However, the number of turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical is different for negative angles.

For example, if we input -60, the normalized angle is 300. But in the problem description, a negative angle represents counter-clockwise rotation, and the image from the camera is rotated clockwise by the same amount. So, in this case, the image is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. To minimize the deviation from vertical, we need 3 turns of 90 degrees clockwise, as explained in the problem description.

However, the program calculates the number of turns as (360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 2, which is incorrect.

Here's the correct Python function:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    turns = round(normalized_angle / 90) % 4
    print(turns)
```

Or another correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    min_deviation = float('inf')
    min_turns = 0
    for turns in range(4):
        total_angle = (90 * turns) - normalized_angle
        if total_angle < 0:
            total_angle += 360
        deviation = total_angle if total_angle <= 180 else 360 - total_angle
        if deviation < min_deviation:
            min_deviation = deviation
            min_turns = turns
    print(min_turns)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads an integer input from the user representing a camera angle in degrees, normalizes the angle to be within the range of -360 to 360 degrees, calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to reach a specific position based on the normalized angle, and prints the result. However, the function does not handle negative input angles correctly, does not perform any error checking, and does not account for input values outside the range of -10^18 to 10^18. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
