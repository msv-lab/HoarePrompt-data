Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle negative input angles correctly. The line `normalized_angle = x % 360` normalizes the angle to be within the range of 0 to 360 degrees, but it does not account for the case where the input angle is negative. 

In the problem description, a negative value denotes counter-clockwise camera rotation. However, the given code does not correctly handle this case. 

For example, if the input angle is -60, the normalized angle will be 300 (since -60 % 360 = 300), but the correct normalized angle should be 300 (which is equivalent to -60 degrees). 

Then, the line `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` calculates the number of 90-degree turns required, but it does not give the correct result for negative input angles.

To correctly handle negative input angles, the code should normalize the angle to be within the range of 0 to 360 degrees, taking into account the direction of rotation.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    if normalized_angle <= 90:
        print((90 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4)
    else:
        print(turns)
```
However, a more straightforward and correct solution would be:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    if normalized_angle <= 45:
        print(0)
    elif normalized_angle <= 135:
        print(1)
    elif normalized_angle <= 225:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(3)
```
Or an even simpler solution:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    if x % 360 in [315, -45, 45, -315]:
        print(3)
    elif x % 360 in [270, -90, 90, -270]:
        print(2)
    elif x % 360 in [225, -135, 135, -225]:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```
