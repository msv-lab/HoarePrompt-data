The function reads an integer input from the user representing a camera angle in degrees, normalizes the angle to be within the range of -360 to 360 degrees, calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to reach a specific position based on the normalized angle, and prints the result. However, the function does not handle negative input angles correctly, does not perform any error checking, and does not account for input values outside the range of -10^18 to 10^18.
