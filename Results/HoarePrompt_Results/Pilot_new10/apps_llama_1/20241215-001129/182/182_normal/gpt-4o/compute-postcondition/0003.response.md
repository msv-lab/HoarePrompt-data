The code provided is a print statement, which outputs the value of `turns` to the console. This operation does not change the values of any variables. 

The value of `x` remains an integer between -10^18 and 10^18. 
The value of `normalized_angle` remains the remainder of `x` divided by 360, an integer between -359 and 359. 
The value of `turns` remains `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, an integer between 0 and 3.

The print statement causes the value of `turns` to be returned at the output.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18, `normalized_angle` is the remainder of `x` divided by 360, an integer between -359 and 359, `turns` is `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, an integer between 0 and 3, and the value of `turns` is returned at the output.**
