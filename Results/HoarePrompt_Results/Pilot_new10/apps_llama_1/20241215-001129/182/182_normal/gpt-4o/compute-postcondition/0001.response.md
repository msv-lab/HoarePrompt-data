The code calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 360 and assigns it to `normalized_angle`. Since `x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18, the value of `normalized_angle` will be between -359 and 359 (inclusive) due to the properties of the modulo operation.

For example, if `x` is 360 or a multiple of 360, `normalized_angle` will be 0. If `x` is between 360 and 719, `normalized_angle` will be between 1 and 359. If `x` is between -360 and -1, `normalized_angle` will be between -359 and -1.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18, `normalized_angle` is the remainder of `x` divided by 360, an integer between -359 and 359.**
