Based on the provided information, I will analyze the original assessment and the output hints to determine the correctness of the program.

The original assessment states that the program is correct, providing a breakdown of why it appears to be correct based on the problem description. However, the output hints raise some concerns about the program's handling of negative input angles and lack of error checking.

Upon closer examination, I notice that the program does not handle negative input angles correctly. According to the problem description, a negative value denotes counter-clockwise rotation, but the program's calculation of `normalized_angle = x % 360` does not account for this. When `x` is negative, `x % 360` will be a negative value, which is then not correctly normalized.

The output hints also mention that the function does not perform any error checking, which could be a concern if the program does not handle invalid inputs correctly. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not a major concern in this case.

The key issue lies in the program's handling of negative input angles. The original assessment does not fully address this concern, and upon further analysis, I believe that the program's calculation of `normalized_angle` is not correct for negative input values.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment was not accurate.

Final: **False**
