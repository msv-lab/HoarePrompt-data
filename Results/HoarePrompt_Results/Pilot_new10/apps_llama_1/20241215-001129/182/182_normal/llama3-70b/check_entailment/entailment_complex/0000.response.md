Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. 

The problem description requires the program to find the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which the up direction deviation from vertical is minimum. The up direction deviation from vertical is achieved by rotating the image by the camera angle counter-clockwise.

Let's analyze the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` in the program. This expression does not correctly calculate the minimum number of turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical. 

For a given angle `x`, the program should try all possible rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees clockwise) and find the one that results in the minimum deviation from the vertical.

Here's a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360  # Normalize the angle to the range [0, 360)
    if x < 0:
        x += 360  # Convert to the range [0, 360)
    min_deviation = float('inf')
    min_turns = 0
    for turns in range(4):  # Try all possible rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees clockwise)
        deviation = abs((x + turns * 90) % 360 - 180)
        if deviation > 180:
            deviation = 360 - deviation
        if deviation < min_deviation:
            min_deviation = deviation
            min_turns = turns
    print(min_turns)
```
This program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to get a picture in which the up direction deviation from vertical is minimum. 

The program provided does not follow this logic and therefore does not meet the problem description.
