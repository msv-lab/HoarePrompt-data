Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Here's why it works:

1. The program reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the camera angle in degrees. The problem description states that the input value can range from -10^18 to 10^18, but since the angle is taken modulo 360, the effective range is -359 to 359.

2. The expression `x = x % 360` ensures that the angle `x` is within the range -359 to 359. This is because any angle greater than 359 or less than -359 can be reduced to an equivalent angle within this range by adding or subtracting 360.

3. When `x` is 0, the program prints 0. This is correct because a camera rotation of 0 degrees means that the image does not need to be rotated, so the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required is 0.

4. When `x` is not 0, the program prints `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This expression works as follows:

   - `x + 90`: This shifts the angle `x` by 90 degrees, effectively rotating the camera 90 degrees clockwise.
   
   - `- 1`: This is done to ensure that the division by 90 rounds down, because the `- 1` makes the number slightly smaller. This is equivalent to using the `math.floor` function.
   
   - `// 90`: This divides the result by 90 and discards the remainder, effectively rounding down to the nearest multiple of 90.
   
   - `% 4`: This takes the result modulo 4, ensuring that the final answer is between 0 and 3 (inclusive). This is because there are only four possible 90-degree rotations (0, 90, 180, and 270), and the program needs to find the one that minimizes the deviation from vertical.

5. The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` effectively finds the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to rotate the image so that it is minimally deviated from vertical. This is because it rounds down the angle `x + 90` to the nearest multiple of 90, which gives the number of 90-degree turns required to rotate the image to the nearest multiple of 90 degrees. The modulo 4 operation then ensures that the result is between 0 and 3, which corresponds to the minimum number of turns required.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description, and it produces the correct output for all possible input values of `x`.
