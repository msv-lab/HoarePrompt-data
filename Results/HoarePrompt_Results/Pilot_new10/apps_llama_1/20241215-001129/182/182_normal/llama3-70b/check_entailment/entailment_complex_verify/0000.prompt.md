You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.

One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?

But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.

Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.

Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to "true up". [Image] 

The next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.


-----Examples-----
Input
60

Output
1

Input
-60

Output
3



-----Note-----

When the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.

From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if x == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program determines the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to rotate an image captured by a camera so that the image's up direction is minimally deviated from the vertical up direction. The camera's rotation angle is inputted as an integer x in degrees, where positive values denote clockwise rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's logic:

1. The input angle x is taken modulo 360 to reduce it to a value within the range [0, 360). This is because a rotation of 360 degrees or a multiple of 360 degrees is equivalent to no rotation.
2. If the input angle x is 0, the program prints 0, because no rotation is needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical up direction.
3. For non-zero input angles x, the program calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to rotate the image to minimize its deviation from the vertical up direction. The formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is used to achieve this.

This formula works as follows:

- `x + 90 - 1` shifts the input angle x by 90 degrees clockwise and subtracts 1 to ensure that the result of the integer division is the smallest possible value.
- `(x + 90 - 1) // 90` calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to rotate the image so that its up direction is minimally deviated from the vertical up direction. This is because the result of the integer division gives the smallest number of 90 degrees turns that would rotate the image to a position closest to the vertical up direction.
- `% 4` ensures that the result is within the range [0, 3], which corresponds to the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required.

This program handles all possible input angles x, including positive, negative, and zero values, and it correctly determines the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to rotate the image to minimize its deviation from the vertical up direction. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but it reads an integer x from the input, where x is the camera angle in degrees, -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, and a positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, while a negative value denotes counter-clockwise rotation.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if (x == 0) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive), where a positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation and a negative value denotes counter-clockwise rotation. If `x` is 0, it denotes no camera rotation. If `x` is not 0, an integer value between 0 and 3 (inclusive) has been printed based on the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a camera angle in degrees from the input, normalizes it to an equivalent angle between -359 and 359 degrees, and then outputs 0 if the normalized angle is 0 (indicating no rotation or a full rotation), or otherwise categorizes the rotation into one of four categories based on the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` and prints the corresponding category number.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
