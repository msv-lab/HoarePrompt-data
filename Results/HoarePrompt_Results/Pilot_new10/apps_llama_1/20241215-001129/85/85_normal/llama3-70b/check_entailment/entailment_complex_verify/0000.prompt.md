You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly because it only checks pairs of shovels where one shovel's cost is `i` and the other shovel's cost is `n - i`. However, the problem statement does not restrict the pairs to this format. It only requires that the sum of the costs of the two shovels ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

For example, if `n = 10`, the program will only check the pairs `(1, 9)`, `(2, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, `(4, 6)`, and `(5, 5)`. However, it will not check the pair `(6, 4)`, which also has a sum that ends with a maximum possible number of nines.

Additionally, the program's logic for checking the maximum possible number of nines is also incorrect. It checks if the sum of the costs is divisible by `10` raised to the power of the number of digits in the sum minus one. However, this is not the correct way to check for the maximum possible number of nines.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum possible number of nines that can be achieved by summing the costs of two shovels, and then count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum. 

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels, calculate their sum, and keep track of the maximum number of nines seen so far. Then, iterate over all pairs again and count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum number of nines. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    max_nines = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            sum = i + j
            nines = 0
            while sum % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                sum = sum // 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                ans = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There exists a positive integer n representing the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original input integer, `ans` is the number of integers `i` between 1 and `n // 2` (inclusive) for which `n` is divisible by `10` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n` minus 1, and `i` is `n // 2`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the number of times `n` can be divided by `10` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n` minus 1 without a remainder, and prints this count. However, due to the nature of the condition, the count will either be `n // 2` if the divisibility condition is met or 0 if it is not, essentially making the loop's outcome dependent solely on whether `n` meets the specific divisibility criterion.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
