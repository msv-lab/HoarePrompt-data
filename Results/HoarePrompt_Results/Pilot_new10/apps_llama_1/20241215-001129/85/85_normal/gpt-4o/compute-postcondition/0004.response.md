The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, equal to the input integer, and `n` must end in 9, after the execution of the code, the last digit (9) is removed. 

The new value of `n` is the input integer without its last digit. 

`max_9s` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer without its last digit (which was 9), `max_9s` is 1**
