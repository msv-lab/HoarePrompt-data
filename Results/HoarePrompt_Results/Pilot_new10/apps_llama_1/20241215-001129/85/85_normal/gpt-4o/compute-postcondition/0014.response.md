The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters, but based on the problem description, it can be inferred that the function takes an integer `n` as input, where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and represents the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop. However, the output description is missing, which is necessary to determine the return value of the function.


Since the output description is missing, I'll provide a general format for the functionality based on the given information. Once the output description is provided, the functionality can be updated to include the return value.


Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of shovels, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and returns a value based on the given output conditions, which are currently not specified.**
