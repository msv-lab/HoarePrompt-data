The code snippet is taking an input and converting it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `n`. 

The initial state mentions that the input `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, but this information is not directly used in the code snippet. However, based on the problem description, we can infer that the input `n` should still satisfy this condition.

After executing the code, the value of `n` is updated to the input integer. The input integer is expected to be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, based on the problem description.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, equal to the input integer**
