To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given condition and states.

The loop condition is `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, which means the loop will execute as long as `n + 1` is a multiple of 10. Given that `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` is true at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that `n + 1` ends in 0, and thus `n` ends in 9.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer without its last two digits (the last being 9 and the one before it).
- `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, which means `n` ends in 9.
- `max_9s` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still satisfy the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` after the adjustment. However, since `n` ends in 9 and we are removing the last two digits (which are 9 and another digit before it) from the input integer to form `n`, the next iteration's `n` should also satisfy the condition that its last digit is 9 to ensure `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`.

Considering the state adjustments:
- The condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` being true doesn't directly require an adjustment since it's about the current state of `n`.
- `n` being the input integer without its last two digits implies that for the next iteration, if we were to conceptually add back those digits and then remove them again, `n` should still end in a digit that allows `n + 1` to be a multiple of 10 after the loop body executes.
- `max_9s` being 2 is a constant state here but does not influence the loop condition directly.

Since the loop condition is dependent on `n` and specifically that `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10, the critical adjustment is ensuring that after any modifications within the loop body (which are not specified here), `n` could conceptually be in a state that satisfies the loop condition again. Given the provided information, it's understood that `n` inherently ends in a 9 because of how it's defined and the fact that `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`.

To proceed with the next iteration, the state of `n` essentially needs to conceptually allow for the removal and addition of digits in such a way that it can satisfy `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` again, but given the information, `n` itself doesn't need an explicit adjustment for the loop condition; the focus is more on the structure of the input integer and how `n` is derived from it, ensuring that `n` could potentially end in a digit that makes `n + 1` a multiple of 10 after any loop body execution.

State: **`n` is the input integer without its last two digits (the last being 9 and the one before it), `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, `max_9s` is 2**
