`max_9s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `max_9s` was 1, so the new value of `max_9s` is 2. The value of `n` and the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer without its last digit (which was 9), `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, `max_9s` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer without its last digit (which was 9), `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, `max_9s` is 2**
