The function accepts an integer `n` as input from the user, counts the number of trailing 9s in `n`, calculates the value `(n + 1) * max_9s` where `max_9s` is the count of trailing 9s, and prints this value, assuming `n` ends with one or more 9s; if `n` does not end with a 9, `max_9s` will be 0, and the function will simply print `n + 1` multiplied by 0, which is 0; the function does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases explicitly.
