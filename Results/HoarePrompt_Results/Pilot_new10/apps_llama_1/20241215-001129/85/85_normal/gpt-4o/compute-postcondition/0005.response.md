To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given condition in the `while` loop: `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This condition checks if `n + 1` is divisible by 10, meaning the last digit of `n + 1` must be 0.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer without its last digit (which was 9).
- `max_9s` is 1.

Given that the loop can execute again, we need `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` to be true. This implies that `n + 1` should end in 0, meaning `n` should end in 9.

However, the state of `n` is described as the input integer without its last digit, which was 9. This means `n` currently does not end in 9 but rather is the integer part of the original number without the last digit (9).

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be such that when 1 is added to it, the result is divisible by 10. Given `n`'s current state (lacking its last digit, which was 9), for `n + 1` to be divisible by 10, the original number before removing the last digit (9) must have been a number that ends in 9. Since `n` is now without this last digit, adding 1 to `n` would make it end in 0, but only if the digit before the 9 (which is now the last digit of `n`) is considered.

However, since we're focusing on the condition that needs to be met for the loop to execute again, and given that `n` has been modified (it's the original number without its last digit, which was 9), we need to ensure that the next iteration can happen based on the loop's condition. The critical insight here is recognizing that for `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` to be true, `n` itself must be positioned such that adding 1 makes it a multiple of 10, but since `n` is defined as lacking its last digit (which was 9), the actual condition we're working with is about ensuring that the loop can proceed based on the given states.

Given that `max_9s` is 1, which does not directly affect the loop's condition but indicates that at least one 9 has been encountered (the last digit of the original number), and considering that `n` represents the number without its last digit (9), for the loop to potentially execute again, we are essentially looking at how `n`'s state needs to be considered in the context of the loop's condition.

The condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` will be true if `n` ends in 9, but since `n` is defined as the number without its last digit (which was 9), we are considering the scenario where adding 1 to the current state of `n` (which does not end in 9 because its last digit, 9, has been removed) would make it a multiple of 10. However, this analysis is slightly misguided because we're considering the wrong aspect of `n`'s transformation.

The correct perspective is that since `n` is the input integer without its last digit (9), and we are looking at a condition that checks if `n + 1` ends in 0, we actually need to consider what this means for `n`'s state and the loop's execution. Given `n` and the fact that we've removed a 9 from the end, the loop's condition actually hints at the necessity of `n` being in a state where adding 1 could conceptually align with the loop's requirement, but the direct modification or consideration should be about ensuring the loop can execute based on its own condition, not necessarily altering `n`'s form but understanding the implications of its current state.

Given this, the adjustment isn't about changing `n` or `max_9s` directly in a way that alters their fundamental state but recognizing what the loop's condition implies for the next iteration. Since `n` is specified as lacking its last digit (which was 9), and `max_9s` indicates at least one 9 has been encountered, the loop's ability to execute again hinges on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, which, given `n`'s defined state, suggests a consideration of how `n`'s current form (without its last digit, 9) impacts the loop's potential next execution.

However, my analysis initially overlooked the simplicity of the task, which asks to modify the program state so the next iteration can proceed, based on the loop condition and given states. Given `n` is the input integer without its last digit (which was 9), for `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` to be true (indicating `n + 1` ends in 0, thus `n` would end in 9 if it hadn't been modified), the focus should actually be on the loop's condition and what it requires for `n` to enable another iteration.

Therefore, considering the need for clarity and adherence to the task's requirements, the actual adjustment or consideration needed for the loop to execute one more time, based on the given condition and states, should directly address the loop's requirement without overcomplicating the interpretation of `n`'s state.

State: **`n` is the input integer without its last digit (which was 9), and for the loop to execute again, we must consider the implication of `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, `max_9s` is 1**
