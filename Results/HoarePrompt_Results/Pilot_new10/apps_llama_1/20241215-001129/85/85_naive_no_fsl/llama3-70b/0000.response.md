Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue with the program is that it only checks for pairs of shovels where one shovel is in the first half of the range of shovels and the other is in the second half. However, the problem description does not have this restriction, and the program should check for all possible pairs of shovels.

For example, if n = 10, the program will only check pairs like (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), and (5, 5), but it will not check pairs like (1, 8) and (2, 9), even though these pairs also have a total cost that ends with a 9.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check all possible pairs of shovels, not just the ones where one shovel is in the first half and the other is in the second half. 

A correct approach would be to iterate over all pairs of shovels and check if their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

Here's an example of how the correct code could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1):
            total_cost = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total_cost % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total_cost //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                ans = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This code checks all possible pairs of shovels and keeps track of the maximum number of nines that can be obtained. It then counts the number of pairs that have this maximum number of nines.
