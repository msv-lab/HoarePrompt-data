Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not accurately solve the problem as specified. The problem requires determining the number of pairs of shovels such that the sum of their costs ends with the maximum possible number of nines. However, the program proposed does not correctly calculate this.

The issue with the program lies in its simplistic approach to determining the number of pairs based on the number of shovels `n`. It incorrectly assumes that the number of pairs is directly proportional to `n` and the number of nines in `n`, which does not account for the actual sum of costs of shovel pairs.

For instance, when `n = 1000`, the program does not correctly identify pairs of shovels whose costs sum to numbers ending with the maximum possible number of nines, such as pairs summing to 999, 1998, etc. The program fails to consider the actual sums of the shovel costs and their ending digits.

A correct solution would involve iterating over possible pairs of shovels, calculating the sum of their costs, and counting the number of nines at the end of these sums to identify the maximum possible number of nines and count the corresponding pairs. The program does not implement this logic correctly. 

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly: for `n = 100`, the maximum possible number of nines is 2 (e.g., from the sum of 49 and 50, or other similar pairs), but the program does not correctly calculate this based on its current logic. It simply counts the number of nines in `n+1` and multiplies by `max_9s`, which does not reflect the actual problem constraints or requirements.
