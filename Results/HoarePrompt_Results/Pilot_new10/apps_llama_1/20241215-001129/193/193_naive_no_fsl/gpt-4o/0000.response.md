Correctness: **True**

The given program calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length x into an equilateral triangle of side length y. 

In the provided program, `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` is a clever formula that takes advantage of the fact that in the worst case, we need to reduce the length of two sides of the triangle to y in order to get the required equilateral triangle of side length y.

Here's a breakdown of the formula:

* `(x - y) // 2` calculates the number of operations needed to reduce the length of two sides from x to y, assuming that we do two operations at a time (one operation for each of the two sides). The `//` operator performs integer division, which gives us the number of whole steps we need to take.
* `(x - y) % 2` checks if we need to do an extra operation to account for the remaining difference between x and y. If `x - y` is odd, then we need to do one more operation to get to y.

This formula works because in the worst case, we need to reduce the length of two sides to y, and we can do this in `(x - y) // 2` steps, with an extra step if `x - y` is odd.

Since the formula correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for all possible inputs within the given constraints, the program is correct.

Note that the problem constraints ensure that x and y are integers and 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000, which means that the formula will always produce a valid result.
