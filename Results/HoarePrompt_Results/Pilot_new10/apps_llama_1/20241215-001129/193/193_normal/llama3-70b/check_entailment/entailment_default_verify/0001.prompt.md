You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`. 

The issue lies in the fact that the program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that in each step, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area).

For example, when `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the program will print `3`, which is incorrect. The correct sequence of transformations as mentioned in the problem description is: `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`, which requires 4 steps, not 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct solution would require a more complex approach that takes into account the constraints of the problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads two integer inputs from the user, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result, without enforcing any specific range or relationship between the input values, and without returning any value. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
