The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it reads two integer inputs from the user. The annotations specify that `x` and `y` should be integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but the code does not enforce these conditions. 

The code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints the result, but it does not return any value. 

The functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: ** The function reads two integer inputs from the user, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result, without enforcing any specific range or relationship between the input values, and without returning any value. **
