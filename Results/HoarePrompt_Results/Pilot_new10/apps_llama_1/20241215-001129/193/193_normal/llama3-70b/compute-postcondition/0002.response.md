It appears there is a discrepancy in the task description. The given function definition is `def func():`, which indicates that the function does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.

Assuming the correct function definition should be `def func(x, y):` based on the parameter constraints, let's proceed with the analysis.


The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, where both `x` and `y` are integers. The constraints on these parameters are such that `y` is greater than or equal to 3, `y` is less than `x`, and `x` is less than or equal to 100,000.


Since the output description is missing, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function. However, we can describe the functionality based on the input parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the return value is not specified.**
