The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is `input1` and the value of `y` is `input2`, where `input1` and `input2` are integers from the user input. 

The states of the variables `x` and `y` are not affected, so their values remain `input1` and `input2` respectively. 

The output of the code is the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which is `abs(input1 - input2)`. This value is printed to the console, but it is not stored in any variable.

Output State: **`x` is `input1`, `y` is `input2`, and the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which is `abs(input1 - input2)`, has been printed**
