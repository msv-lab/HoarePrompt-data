The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the user input. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. However, the condition that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 is no longer guaranteed to hold after the update, as the new values of `x` and `y` are determined by the user input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that `x` and `y` are input integers, `x` = input1 and `y` = input2 where input1 and input2 are integers from the user input**
