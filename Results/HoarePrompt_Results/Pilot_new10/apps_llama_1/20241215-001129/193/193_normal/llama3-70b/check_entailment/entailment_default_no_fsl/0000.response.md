Correctness: **False**

The given code is incorrect because it simply calculates the absolute difference between the initial and final side lengths of the equilateral triangles, without considering the fact that in each step, the length of a single side of the current triangle can be modified such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle.

For example, in the first sample test, the code would output `3` (i.e., `|6 - 3| = 3`), which is incorrect because it takes at least `4` steps to transform the equilateral triangle of side length `6` into an equilateral triangle of side length `3`, as shown in the problem description: `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`.

The code fails to account for the fact that each modification must result in a valid triangle, and that the transformation may involve multiple steps, not just a simple difference between the initial and final side lengths. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
