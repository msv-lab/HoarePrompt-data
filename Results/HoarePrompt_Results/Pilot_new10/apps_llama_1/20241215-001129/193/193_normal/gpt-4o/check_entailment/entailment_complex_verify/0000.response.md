Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems accurate. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`. 

The annotated version of the code does not provide any additional information that would contradict the original assessment. The state of the program before the function call is indeed that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000`. 

The formula works as expected: if `x - y` is even, it calculates the number of operations by dividing the difference by 2; if `x - y` is odd, it adds 1 to the result of the division to account for the remaining side length difference.

The examples provided also confirm the correctness of the formula. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
