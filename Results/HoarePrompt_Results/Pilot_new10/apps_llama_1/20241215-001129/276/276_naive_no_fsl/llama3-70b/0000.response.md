Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality to compare two numbers in the golden system notation. It uses the given formula to convert each number to its decimal equivalent and then compares them.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number in the golden system notation. It iterates over each digit in the string, converts it to an integer, and multiplies it by the corresponding power of `q`. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the decimal value of the expression `a_0a_1...a_{n}` equals to `âˆ‘_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} * q^{n - i}`.

2. The program correctly handles the comparison of two numbers. It calculates the decimal equivalents of both numbers and then compares them using simple conditional statements. This is in line with the problem description, which asks to print `>` if the first number is larger, `<` if it is smaller, and `=` if they are equal.

3. The program does not have any explicit error handling, but it assumes that the input will always be a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, which is in line with the problem description. If the input format is incorrect, the program may not work as expected, but this is not a case of the program being incorrect according to the problem description.

In general, the program seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem, and it should work correctly for all valid inputs. I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description.
