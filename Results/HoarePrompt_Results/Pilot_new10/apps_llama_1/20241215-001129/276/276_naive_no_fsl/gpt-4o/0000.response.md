Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately implements the golden system notation comparison as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, from the input.

2. **Decimal Value Calculation**: The `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number using the formula $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$. This formula is directly derived from the definition of the golden system.

3. **Comparison**: The program then compares the calculated decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the correct comparison result ('>', '<', or '=').

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the decimal values for the given golden system numbers and compares them.

The golden number `q` is calculated as `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`, which matches the problem description. The loop in `func_1` iterates over each character in the input string, adding the corresponding power of `q` to the total value if the character is '1'.

The examples provided in the problem statement demonstrate the correctness of the program for different inputs. The program correctly compares the decimal values of the given golden system numbers and produces the expected output.

Overall, the program accurately implements the required functionality, and no potential case was found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
