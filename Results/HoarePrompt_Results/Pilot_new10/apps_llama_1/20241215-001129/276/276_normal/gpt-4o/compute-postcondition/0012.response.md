Postcondition: ***`s1` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `s2` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '1', then `value` is increased by `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`.***
