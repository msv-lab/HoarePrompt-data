Postcondition: **`s1` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `s2` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and if `s[i]` is '1', then `value` is its initial value (which is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` if `s1[1]` or `s2[1]` is '1', otherwise 0) plus `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, otherwise `value` remains its initial value (which is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` if `s1[1]` or `s2[1]` is '1', otherwise 0).**
