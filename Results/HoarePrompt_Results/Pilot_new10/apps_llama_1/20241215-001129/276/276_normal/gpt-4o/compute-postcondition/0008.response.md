The value of `value` is incremented by `q` raised to the power of `n - i - 1`. We know that `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `value` initially depends on `s1[1]` or `s2[1]`. Given `i` is 1, `n - i - 1` becomes `n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)`, and both `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, and `n` must be greater than 1, we can conclude that `n` is at least 2 and at most 100000.

Initially, `value` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` if `s1[1]` or `s2[1]` is '1', otherwise 0. After the operation, `value` becomes `value + (5*len(s1)+3*len(s2)) ** (n - 2)`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `s2` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `value` is contingent upon its initial value plus `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2)) ** (n - 2)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `s2` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `value` is its initial value (which is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` if `s1[1]` or `s2[1]` is '1', otherwise 0) plus `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2)) ** (n - 2)`**
