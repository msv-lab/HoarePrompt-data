The code defines a variable `q` as `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`, which is approximately 1.618033988749895. This is known as the golden ratio. The values of `s1` and `s2` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895**
