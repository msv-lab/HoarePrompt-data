The function accepts a string s consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of the decimal values of the characters in string s weighted by powers of a constant q, approximately 1.618033988749895. If the string is empty, it returns 0. If the string contains characters other than '0' and '1', it raises a ValueError. The function does not enforce any length constraints on the input string.
