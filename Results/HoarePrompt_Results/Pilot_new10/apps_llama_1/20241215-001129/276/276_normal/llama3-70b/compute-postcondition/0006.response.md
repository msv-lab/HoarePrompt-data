To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000. 
- `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895.
- `decimal` is `int(c) + int(c) * q`.
- `i` is 1.
- `c` is the second to last character in `s`.

The loop statement is `for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1, meaning the loop has already processed the last character of `s` (since `enumerate` starts counting at 0).
- `c` is the second to last character in `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `enumerate` will increment `i` by 1 for each iteration, `i` must be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- The loop iterates over `reversed(s)`, which means it processes the characters of `s` from the end to the start. Therefore, if `c` was the second to last character in `s` during the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `c` must now be the third to last character in `s` (since we're moving one step towards the beginning of the string).
- The state conditions related to `s1`, `s2`, and `q` are not directly affected by the loop iteration itself but are part of the overall program state.

Therefore, adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is to be recalculated based on the new `c`, `i` is 2, `c` is the third to last character in `s`**
