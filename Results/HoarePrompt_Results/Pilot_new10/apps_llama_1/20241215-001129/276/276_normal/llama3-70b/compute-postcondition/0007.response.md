To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables. The code is `decimal += int(c) * q ** i`. 

Given that `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is to be recalculated based on the new `c`, `i` is 2, and `c` is the third to last character in `s`.

Since `c` is a character in a string consisting only of '0' and '1', `int(c)` will be either 0 or 1. 

The value of `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, and `i` is 2. So, `q ** i` is approximately `(1.618033988749895) ** 2`, which equals approximately 2.618033988749895.

Thus, `int(c) * q ** i` will be either 0 (if `c` is '0') or approximately 2.618033988749895 (if `c` is '1').

The initial value of `decimal` is not specified, so we keep it as is and understand that it will increase by either 0 or approximately 2.618033988749895, depending on the value of `c`.

Given that `c` is the third to last character in `s`, and without knowing the exact string `s`, we cannot determine the exact value of `c`. Therefore, `decimal` will either remain the same (if `c` is '0') or increase by approximately 2.618033988749895 (if `c` is '1').

The other variables (`s1`, `s2`, `q`, `i`) do not change.

Output State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is the original value of `decimal` plus either 0 or approximately 2.618033988749895 depending on the third to last character `c` in `s`, `i` is 2**
