You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality to compare two numbers in the golden system notation. It uses the given formula to convert each number to its decimal equivalent and then compares them.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number in the golden system notation. It iterates over each digit in the string, converts it to an integer, and multiplies it by the corresponding power of `q`. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the decimal value of the expression `a_0a_1...a_{n}` equals to `∑_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} * q^{n - i}`.

2. The program correctly handles the comparison of two numbers. It calculates the decimal equivalents of both numbers and then compares them using simple conditional statements. This is in line with the problem description, which asks to print `>` if the first number is larger, `<` if it is smaller, and `=` if they are equal.

3. The program does not have any explicit error handling, but it assumes that the input will always be a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, which is in line with the problem description. If the input format is incorrect, the program may not work as expected, but this is not a case of the program being incorrect according to the problem description.

In general, the program seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem, and it should work correctly for all valid inputs. I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 and s2 are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is the sum of the decimal values of the characters in `s` weighted by powers of `q`, `s` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1' characters.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the sum of the decimal values of the characters in string `s` weighted by powers of `q`, where `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895 and `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1' characters


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
