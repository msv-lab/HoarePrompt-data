The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with a length not exceeding 100000. It calculates the sum of the decimal values of the characters in string `s` weighted by powers of `q`, where `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895. The function uses a loop to iterate over the characters in the string from right to left, multiplying each character's decimal value by a power of `q` and adding it to a running total.

Potential edge cases to consider include:

- An empty string: The function does not check if the input string is empty, which would cause the `enumerate(reversed(s))` line to not execute and the function to return 0.
- A string longer than 100000 characters: Although the annotation states that the string length does not exceed 100000, the function does not enforce this constraint.
- A string containing characters other than '0' and '1': The function does not check if the input string contains characters other than '0' and '1', which would cause the `int(c)` line to raise a ValueError.

Considering these edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string s consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of the decimal values of the characters in string s weighted by powers of a constant q, approximately 1.618033988749895. If the string is empty, it returns 0. If the string contains characters other than '0' and '1', it raises a ValueError. The function does not enforce any length constraints on the input string. **
