Correctness: **True**

The given code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift Ivan, such that all the conditions are met. The conditions are:

- Everyone must gift as many coins as others.
- All coins given to Ivan must be different.
- Not less than L coins from gifts altogether must be new in Ivan's collection.

The code calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `L / M`. This ensures that the total number of new coins gifted is at least `L`.

The code then checks if `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, where `N - K` is the maximum number of new coins that can be gifted. If this condition is met, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints -1.

The output hints agree with the code and provide an explanation of the logic used. The examples given in the problem description also work correctly with the code.

For example, for the input `20 15 2 3`, the code calculates `min_x` as `(3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`, which is correct because each friend can gift one coin, and Ivan will receive at least 3 new coins.

Similarly, for the input `10 11 2 4`, the code calculates `min_x` as `(4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`, but `M * min_x = 11` is greater than `N - K = 8`, so it correctly prints -1.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as per the problem description.
