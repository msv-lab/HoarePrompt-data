Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to Ivan, such that all friends gift the same number of coins, all coins gifted are different, and at least `L` coins are new to Ivan's collection.
2. The program calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `M * min_x >= L`. This ensures that at least `L` coins will be new to Ivan's collection.
3. The program then checks if `M * min_x <= N - K`. This condition ensures that there are enough different coins (`N - K`) that can be gifted to Ivan, such that each friend can gift `min_x` coins and all coins gifted are different.
4. If the condition `M * min_x <= N - K` is true, the program prints `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to satisfy the conditions. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to meet the conditions.

The program correctly implements the problem description, and the calculation of `min_x` ensures that the minimum number of coins is found. The condition `M * min_x <= N - K` correctly checks if it's possible to meet the conditions.

For example, consider the input `20 15 2 3`. The program calculates `min_x` as `(3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`, and since `15 * 1 <= 20 - 2 = 18`, it prints `1`, which is the correct answer.

Similarly, for the input `10 11 2 4`, the program calculates `min_x` as `(4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`, but since `11 * 1 > 10 - 2 = 8`, it prints `-1`, which is also the correct answer.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and finds the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to satisfy the conditions.
