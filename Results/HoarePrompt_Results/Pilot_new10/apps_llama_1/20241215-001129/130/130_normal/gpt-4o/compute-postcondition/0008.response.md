The function `func` does not explicitly specify any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems that the function is supposed to work with the integers N, M, K, and L, where 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, and 1 <= L, and all these integers are within the range [1, 10^18]. 

Since the function definition is empty, I'll assume it should take these integers as parameters. Therefore, the function `func` should accept parameters N, M, K, and L. N, M, K, and L are integers, such that 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, and 1 <= L, and N, M, K, L are within the range [1, 10^18]. 

However, without the actual output description, it is impossible to determine the return value of the function. Please provide the output description to proceed.


If we receive the output, we will be able to do something like this:

The function `func` accepts parameters N, M, K, and L. N, M, K, and L are integers, such that 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, and 1 <= L, and N, M, K, L are within the range [1, 10^18]. 

After executing the function body, 
Case_1:.... 
Case_2:.... 
...
Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to....
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, M, K, and L, returns....** 

But based on the provided data we can do:

The function `func` accepts no parameters. 
However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems that the function is supposed to work with the integers N, M, K, and L, where 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, and 1 <= L, and all these integers are within the range [1, 10^18]. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to  accept no parameters but is related to integers N, M, K, and L.
