The given code prints -1, which means it returns -1 as the output of the program. The values of the variables do not change, but the value -1 is returned as output. 

Output State: **N is an integer, M is an integer where 1 <= M, K is an integer, L is an integer where 1 <= L, `min_x` is (L + M - 1) // M, (M * min_x) is greater than (N - K), and the value -1 has been returned as output.**
