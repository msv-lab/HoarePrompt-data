The given code `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the `read` function from `sys.stdin` to the variable `input`. The values of the variables N, M, K, and L remain unchanged. The `read` function is used to read the entire contents of the standard input.

Output State: **N, M, K, and L are integers, such that 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, and 1 <= L, and N, M, K, L are within the range [1, 10^18], `input` is assigned the `read` function from `sys.stdin`.**
