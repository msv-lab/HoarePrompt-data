Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description requires that all friends gift the same number of coins, and all coins gifted must be different.
2. The problem description also requires that at least `L` coins from the gifts must be new in Ivan's collection.
3. The minimum number of coins that can be gifted to satisfy these conditions is when each friend gifts 1 coin.
4. In this case, the total number of coins gifted will be `M`, and if `M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L`, then it is guaranteed that at least `L` coins will be new in Ivan's collection.

The program checks these conditions and prints 1 if they are met, and -1 otherwise. This is the minimum number of coins that can be gifted to satisfy the conditions, as required by the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The condition `M >= N - K + 1` ensures that there are enough friends to gift at least `N - K` coins, which is the number of coins that Ivan doesn't have. This guarantees that at least `N - K` coins will be gifted.
2. The condition `M >= L` ensures that at least `L` coins will be gifted, which is the minimum number of new coins required.
3. If both conditions are met, then it is guaranteed that at least `L` coins will be new in Ivan's collection, and each friend can gift 1 coin to satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
