Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be a correct solution for the given problem description. It checks if the number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to both `N - K + 1` (the maximum number of different new coins that can be given to Ivan) and `L` (the minimum number of new coins required). 

The output hints agree with the code, and it prints `1` when the conditions are met, indicating that each friend can give at least one coin to satisfy all the conditions, and `-1` otherwise.

Let's analyze the conditions further:

- The condition `M >= N - K + 1` ensures that each friend can give a different coin, and the total number of different coins given is at least `N - K + 1`, which means Ivan will get at least `N - K + 1` new coins (since he already has `K` coins). This condition ensures that all friends can give different coins.
- The condition `M >= L` ensures that the total number of new coins given to Ivan is at least `L`, which meets the requirement that at least `L` coins from the gifts must be new in Ivan's collection.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where `M` is equal to `N - K + 1` or `L`. The provided examples also work correctly with the given code.

Therefore, the code seems to be a correct solution to the given problem description.
