Postcondition: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers where their values are determined by the user's input, `N` equals the first input integer, `M` equals the second input integer, `K` equals the third input integer, and `L` equals the fourth input integer. Either `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L`.**
