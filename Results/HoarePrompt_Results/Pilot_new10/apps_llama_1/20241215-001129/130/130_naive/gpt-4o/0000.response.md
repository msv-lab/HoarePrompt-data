Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to Ivan, ensuring that at least $L$ coins are new and that all friends gift an equal number of coins.

The program uses the formula `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` to calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift. This formula ensures that the total number of coins gifted is at least $L$ and that all friends gift an equal number of coins.

The condition `if M * min_x <= N - K` checks whether it is possible to gift the calculated minimum number of coins to Ivan, given the number of friends, the number of different coins, and the number of coins Ivan already has. If this condition is true, the program prints the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, as shown in the provided examples. In the first example, where $N = 20$, $M = 15$, $K = 2$, and $L = 3$, the program correctly outputs 1, as each friend can gift 1 coin to satisfy all the conditions. In the second example, where $N = 10$, $M = 11$, $K = 2$, and $L = 4$, the program correctly outputs -1, as it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it appears that the program is correct and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
