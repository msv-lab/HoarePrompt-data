Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. It first reads the input values for the total number of different coins (`N`), the number of friends (`M`), the number of coins Ivan already has (`K`), and the minimum number of new coins that must be gifted (`L`).

2. It calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which represents the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure that Ivan receives at least `L` new coins, considering the worst-case scenario where some of the coins gifted are duplicates of those Ivan already has.

3. The program checks if `M * min_x` (the total number of coins gifted) is less than or equal to `N - K` (the total number of coins that Ivan doesn't have). This condition ensures that it's possible for all friends to gift different coins and that Ivan will receive at least `L` new coins.

4. If the condition is met, it prints `min_x`, indicating the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift.

5. If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to satisfy all the given conditions.

This logic correctly covers all possible cases based on the problem description. The program accurately calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to ensure that Ivan receives at least `L` new coins while considering the constraint that all friends must gift the same number of coins and that these coins must be different.

Without finding a specific counterexample where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all intended cases.
