Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when `M` is greater than `N - K + 1` but `M` is less than `L`. In this case, the friends cannot give 1 coin each, as it would not be enough to satisfy the condition of having at least `L` new coins.

For example, consider the input `N = 10`, `M = 8`, `K = 5`, and `L = 7`. The program will print `-1`, which is correct. However, a more optimal solution would be to calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to satisfy the condition.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to satisfy the condition of having at least `L` new coins.

Another issue with the program is that it only checks if `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `L`, but it does not consider the case when `N - K + 1` is greater than `L`. In this case, the friends can give `1` coin each if `M` is greater than or equal to `L`.

For example, consider the input `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, and `L = 3`. The program will correctly print `1`, as each friend can give `1` coin to satisfy the condition.

However, consider the input `N = 20`, `M = 3`, `K = 2`, and `L = 10`. The program will print `-1`, but a more optimal solution would be to calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to satisfy the condition.

A correct solution would be to calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to satisfy the condition, considering all possible cases. 

A possible correct implementation could be:
```python
import math

def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M > N:
        print(-1)
    elif M >= L:
        print(1)
    elif N - K >= L:
        print(math.ceil(L / M))
    else:
        print(-1)
```
This implementation first checks if `M` is greater than `N`, in which case it is impossible to satisfy the condition. Then it checks if `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, in which case each friend can give `1` coin to satisfy the condition. If `M` is less than `L` but `N - K` is greater than or equal to `L`, it calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to satisfy the condition by dividing `L` by `M` and rounding up to the nearest integer. If none of these conditions are met, it prints `-1` to indicate that it is impossible to satisfy the condition.
