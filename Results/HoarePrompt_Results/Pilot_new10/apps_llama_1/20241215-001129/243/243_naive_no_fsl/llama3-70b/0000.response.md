Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The logic of the program is to find the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes by counting the number of factors of 5 in n!. However, the program has a flaw in its implementation.

The condition `if n // 5 ** count < m` is incorrect. This condition will stop the loop as soon as it finds an n for which the number of factors of 5 is less than m, but it should continue to check all n values until it finds all n that have exactly m factors of 5.

For example, if the input is 3, the correct output should be the numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. However, the program will stop as soon as it finds an n for which the number of factors of 5 is less than 3, which means it will miss some of the correct n values.

To fix this, the program should use a different approach, such as using the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n!, which is given by the number of factors of 5 in n!, and then find all n values that satisfy this condition.

Here's an example of how the program can be corrected:
```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    ans = []
    n = 1
    while True:
        num_factors_5 = 0
        temp_n = n
        while temp_n > 0:
            temp_n //= 5
            num_factors_5 += temp_n
        if num_factors_5 > m:
            break
        if num_factors_5 == m:
            ans.append(n)
        n += 1
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

# Test the function
func()
```
This corrected program will correctly find all n values that have exactly m factors of 5 in their factorial, which corresponds to the number of trailing zeros in n!.
