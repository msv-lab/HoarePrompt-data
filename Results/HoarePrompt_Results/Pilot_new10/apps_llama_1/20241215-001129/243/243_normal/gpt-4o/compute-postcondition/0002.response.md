The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `result`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is 0, and `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1).

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), and `result` is an empty list**
