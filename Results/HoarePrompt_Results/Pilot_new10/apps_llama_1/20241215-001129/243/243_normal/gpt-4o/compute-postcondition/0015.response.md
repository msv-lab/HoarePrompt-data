To determine the output state after executing the code snippet `left -= 1`, we'll analyze the given initial state and the effect of the code on it.

Initial State:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `low` is `0`.
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`.
- `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`.
- `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`.
- The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`.
- `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute.

Given the code snippet `left -= 1`, we observe that only the variable `left` is affected. 

Before the decrement, `left` was `5 * m // 2 + 2`. After executing `left -= 1`, its value becomes `5 * m // 2 + 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `5 * m // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state is:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `low` is `0`.
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`.
- `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`.
- `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is `5 * m // 2 + 1`.
- The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`, with the understanding that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is `5 * m // 2 + 1`, and the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`, with the understanding that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute.**
