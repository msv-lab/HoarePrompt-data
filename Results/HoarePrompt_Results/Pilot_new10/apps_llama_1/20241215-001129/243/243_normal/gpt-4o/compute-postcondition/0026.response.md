To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition that governs the loop's execution. The loop will execute as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, 
- `m` retains its initial value, 
- `n` retains its initial value, 
- `low` retains its initial value, 
- `high` retains its initial value, 
- `mid` retains its initial value, 
- `zeroes` retains its initial value, 
- `result` retains its initial value, 
- and `right` is equal to `mid + 3`.

The loop's condition depends solely on `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`. However, the current state indicates that `left` has been decremented to a point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, but this does not directly affect the condition for `right`. The crucial piece of information is that `right` equals `mid + 3`, and the value of `func_1(right)` in relation to `m` will determine whether the loop can proceed.

Since `right` is `mid + 3`, and there's no direct information that `func_1(mid + 3)` does not equal `m`, we must ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to execute again. Given that `m` retains its initial value, the adjustment needed is not about changing `m` but ensuring that `func_1,right)` can indeed equal `m`.

However, considering the constraint that `right` equals `mid + 3` and no information about the nature of `func_1` (whether it's monotonic, periodic, etc.), the only state that directly impacts the loop's condition is the relationship between `right` and the function `func_1`. Therefore, we need to adjust our understanding to reflect that `right` should be in a state where `func_1(right)` can equal `m` for the loop to proceed. Given that `right` is determined as `mid + 3` and no explicit change to `mid` or `right` is suggested based on the provided final states, we focus on the condition that must hold for the loop to execute again.

Given this, we recognize that `func_1(right)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue. Since `right` is defined as `mid + 3`, for the loop to execute one more time, it must be possible for `func_1(mid + 3)` to equal `m`. The information about `left` and its relation to `m` through `func_1` does not directly affect the condition for `right`. Hence, we must ensure that the condition for the loop (`func_1(right) == m`) can be met given the current state of `right` as `mid + 3`.

The state adjustments focus on ensuring the loop condition can be satisfied. Given `m` retains its initial value, the critical factor is the relationship between `func_1(right)` and `m`. Since we do not have explicit details about `func_1`'s behavior, we acknowledge that `right`, as defined by `mid + 3`, needs to be in a state where `func_1(right)` can indeed equal `m` for the loop to proceed.

State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, and `right` is equal to `mid + 3` where `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
