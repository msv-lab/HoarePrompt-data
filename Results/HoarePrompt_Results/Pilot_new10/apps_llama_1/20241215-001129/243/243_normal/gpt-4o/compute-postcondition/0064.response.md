The code initializes an empty list `result`. The initial state mentions several variables: `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes`. The code does not affect the values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, or `zeroes`.

The value of `m` is still a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`. The condition for `n` remains `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`. The relationship between `low` and `high` is unchanged, with `low` being less than or equal to `high`. The value of `mid` is still `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is still equal to `func_1(mid)`.

However, a new variable `result` is introduced and initialized as an empty list `[]`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`.**
