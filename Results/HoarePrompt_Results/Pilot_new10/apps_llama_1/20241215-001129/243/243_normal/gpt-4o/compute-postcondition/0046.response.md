To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive).
   - `n` satisfies the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`.
   - `left` starts as `mid`, and `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`.
   - `result` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Conditions and Updates**:
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Output States After Loop Executions**:
   - After 1 iteration: `left` becomes `mid - 1`.
   - After 2 iterations: `left` becomes `mid - 2`.
   - After 3 iterations: `left` is further decremented, showing a pattern where `left` decreases by 1 in each iteration.

Based on these patterns and conditions, we can infer the following:
- The loop will decrement `left` until `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`.
- The value of `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes` does not change within the loop as per the given code.
- `result` remains an empty list throughout the loop's execution since there's no operation updating it within the loop.
- The loop's termination condition is when `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, but the exact value of `left` at termination isn't specified directly. However, given the decrement pattern, `left` will decrease until the condition is no longer met.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is characterized by:
- `m` remaining the same as it was initially set.
- `n` maintaining its relationship with `m` through the given condition, though its actual calculation or value isn't directly affected by the loop.
- `low` and `high` remaining unchanged as they are not updated within the loop.
- `mid` remaining as the average of `low` and `high`.
- `left` being decremented until `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, with its final value depending on when this condition is met.
- `zeroes` remaining the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, as `mid` does not change.
- `result` staying an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and `result` is an empty list.**
