The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The initial state is `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, so the new value of `right` is `mid + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, and `right` is equal to `mid + 2`.
Output State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, and `right` is equal to `mid + 2`.**
