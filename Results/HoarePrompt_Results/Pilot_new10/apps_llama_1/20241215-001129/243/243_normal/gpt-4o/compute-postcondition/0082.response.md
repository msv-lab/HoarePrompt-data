The code snippet is a `break` statement, which exits the nearest enclosing loop. The initial state provides information about several variables: `left`, `zeroes`, `result`, `m`, and `right`. 

Given the `break` statement, the values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `m` is a positive integer, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
