Based on the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can analyze the final output state of the loop.

From the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can see that the loop is performing a binary search to find the range of values for which the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number equals `m`. The `low` and `high` variables are adjusted based on the relationship between the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` and `m`.

After the loop has finished executing, the `low` variable will be greater than the `high` variable if the loop did not find a range of values that satisfy the condition. In this case, the `result` list will be empty.

However, if the loop finds a range of values that satisfy the condition, the `result` list will contain the range of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, and `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

In both cases, the `low` variable will be greater than the `high` variable, indicating that the loop has finished executing.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `low` is greater than `high`, and `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` and `right` are determined based on the relationship between the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` and `m`.

Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` and `right` are determined based on the relationship between the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` and the original value of `m`.**
