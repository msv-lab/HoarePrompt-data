Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately follows the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function `func_1(n)`** calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`. This function works by summing up the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5, which is a mathematical formula to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`** uses binary search to find the range of values of `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It does this by maintaining a search range `[low, high]` and checking the midpoint `mid`. If the number of trailing zeroes in `mid!` is less than `m`, it moves the search range to `[mid+1, high]`. If the number of trailing zeroes is greater than `m`, it moves the search range to `[low, mid-1]`. If the number of trailing zeroes is equal to `m`, it finds the range of values by moving left and right from `mid` until it finds values that have a different number of trailing zeroes.

3. The main part of the program reads an integer `m` from the input, calls `func_2(m)` to find the range of values of `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, and then prints the number of values in the range and the values themselves.

The program is correct because it uses a valid mathematical formula to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial and uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the range of values that satisfy the condition. The program also handles the case where there are no values of `n` that satisfy the condition, in which case it prints 0.

The program does not have any obvious bugs or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, it is correct according to the problem description.
