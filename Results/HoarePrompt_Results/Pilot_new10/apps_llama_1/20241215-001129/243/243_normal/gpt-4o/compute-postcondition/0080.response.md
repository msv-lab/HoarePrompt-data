To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
while func_1(right) == m:
    right += 1
```
This loop will continue to execute as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. In each iteration, `right` is incremented by 1.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:
- `left`, `zeroes`, `result`, and `m` remain unchanged throughout the iterations.
- `right` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from `mid + 1`.

The key to determining the output state after all iterations is understanding the condition that stops the loop: `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`. Since we do not have the exact definition of `func_1`, we can infer based on the loop's behavior that it will stop when `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, meaning `right` has reached a value for which `func_1(right)` returns a different value than `m`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the output state will be:
- `left` remains the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`.
- `zeroes` equals `m`.
- `result` remains an empty list `[]`.
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `right` will be the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, indicating the loop has stopped.

Output State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `m` is a positive integer, and `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.**
