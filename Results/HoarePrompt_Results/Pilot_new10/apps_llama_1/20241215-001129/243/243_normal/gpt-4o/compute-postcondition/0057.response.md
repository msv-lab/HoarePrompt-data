Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`. If the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and the values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `result` are adjusted accordingly based on the new relationship between `zeroes` and `m`. Otherwise, `low` and `high` remain unchanged, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `right` is the smallest value greater than the initial `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and the loop or if statement is terminated.**
