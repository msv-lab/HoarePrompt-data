The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was `(low + high) // 2`, so the new value of `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`**
