To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `while func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute again, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must still be true after the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `low` is `0`.
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`.
- `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`.
- `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is `left - 1`.
- The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`.

Since the loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must continue to equal `m`. Given that `left` is `left - 1`, for `func_1(left)` to still equal `m`, the function `func_1` must produce the same output `m` for the new value of `left`.

However, without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot directly infer how `left` or other variables should be adjusted to ensure `func_1(left) == m` remains true. But since `left` is decremented by 1 and we want the loop to potentially execute again, we need to consider the constraints that could allow `func_1(left)` to still equal `m`.

Since `left` is decreased by 1, for the loop to potentially execute again, we must ensure that `func_1(left - 1)` could also equal `m`. This means the state of `left` needs to be such that `func_1` of its new value (`left - 1`) equals `m`. Without the specifics of `func_1`, this is more about the concept that `left`'s new state must be compatible with the loop's condition.

Thus, considering the lack of information about `func_1` and focusing on the given variables and their states:
- The critical adjustment for the loop to potentially execute again is that `left` must be in a state where `func_1(left)` could equal `m`. Given `left` is `left - 1`, this means we are looking at a new value of `left`.
- Other variables like `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` are not directly implicated in the loop condition. Their states are a result of the previous iteration and do not need adjustment based solely on the loop condition provided.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` could equal `m`, and the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`.**
