To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `low <= high`. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `low` is `0`.
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`.
- `result` is an empty list.

The loop's condition is `low <= high`. Since `low` is `0` and `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, and given that `m` is a positive integer, `high` will always be greater than `low` because `5 * (m + 1)` will always be greater than `0` for any positive `m`. 

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state variables for the loop to execute at least one time, as the condition `low <= high` is guaranteed to be true given the initial conditions.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), and `result` is an empty list**
