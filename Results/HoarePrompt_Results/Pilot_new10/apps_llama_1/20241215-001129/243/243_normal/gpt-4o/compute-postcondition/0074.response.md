To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`.

Given that:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `right` equals `mid + 1`.
- `left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`.
- `zeroes` equals `m`.
- `result` is an empty list `[]`.

The loop condition depends solely on `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. 

Since `right` equals `mid + 1`, and there's no direct information provided about `func_1` or its behavior with respect to `mid` or `m`, the critical piece of information is the relationship between `func_1(right)` and `m`.

For `func_1(right)` to equal `m`, given that `m` is derived from a specific formula involving `n` and considering the constraints on `m`, it implies that `right` (which is `mid + 1`) must be such that `func_1` of this value equals the count of factors of 5 in all numbers up to `n`, as represented by `m`.

Thus, the adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is that `func_1(right)` must indeed equal `m`, which means the state of `right` (or equivalently, `mid`) must be such that this condition is met. Since we cannot directly adjust `func_1` or its result, we must ensure that the conditions under which `func_1` operates can potentially yield `m`. 

Given `m`'s derivation and the constraints on it, it's implicit that `n` (though not directly stated in the initial conditions) and the function `func_1` itself play critical roles in determining the loop's executability.

However, without explicit details on `func_1`'s behavior or `n`'s value, we focus on the necessity that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to execute. The given states (`left`, `zeroes`, `result`, and `m`) indirectly influence or are influenced by this condition but do not directly dictate the loop's first execution except through their relationships with `right` and `m`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the critical state adjustment is ensuring that `func_1(right)` can equal `m`, which is inherently tied to the definitions and behaviors of `func_1` and the value of `right` (`mid + 1`).

State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, and `right` equals `mid + 1` and is such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.**
