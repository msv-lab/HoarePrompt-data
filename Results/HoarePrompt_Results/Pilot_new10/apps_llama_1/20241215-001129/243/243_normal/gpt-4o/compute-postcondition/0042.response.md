To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given condition and the variables involved.

The loop condition is `while func_1(left) == m:`, which means the loop will continue as long as the result of `func_1(left)` equals `m`. 

Given that `left` is `((low + high) // 2) - 1` and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` after the previous iteration.

However, without knowing the specifics of `func_1`, we can infer that the loop's continuation depends on the relationship between `left` (or its calculation) and `m`. 

If `func_1(left)` is supposed to calculate something based on `left` that should equal `m`, and given that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, and `n` satisfies a condition related to the division of `n` by powers of 5, we don't have direct information on how `func_1(left)` relates to `n` or its condition. 

But since we are tasked with ensuring the loop can execute one more time, and given that `left` is directly derived from `low` and `high`, and `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, for the loop to potentially continue, we must ensure that the conditions around `left` and its relationship to `m` (through `func_1`) are such that `func_1(left)` can still equal `m`.

Since we do not have explicit details on `func_1` and its behavior, and given that `result` is an empty list which does not directly impact the loop condition, we must focus on the variables directly involved in the loop condition.

The key here is understanding that `func_1(left)` needs to equal `m` for the loop to continue. Without explicit behavior of `func_1`, we cannot directly modify `left` or `m` without making assumptions. However, we can infer that if `func_1(left)` equals `m` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the relationship between `left` (as calculated from `low` and `high`) and `m` must be such that `func_1(left)` can still potentially equal `m`.

Given the constraints and aiming to avoid assumptions about `func_1`'s behavior, the state adjustments should focus on ensuring that the loop condition `func_1(left) == m` can be met again, but without specific knowledge of `func_1`, we're limited in how we can adjust the state.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `((low + high) // 2) - 1`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, and the relationship between `left` and `m` through `func_1` must be such that `func_1(left)` can equal `m` again**
