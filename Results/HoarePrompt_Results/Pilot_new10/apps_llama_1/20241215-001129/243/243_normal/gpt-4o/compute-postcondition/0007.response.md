The value of `low` becomes `mid + 1`, where `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `5 * m // 2 + 3`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, the current value of `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` and is less than `m`, and `result` is an empty list.
