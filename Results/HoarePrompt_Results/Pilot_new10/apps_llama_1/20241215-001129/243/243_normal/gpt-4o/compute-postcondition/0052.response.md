To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `while func_1(right) == m`.

For the loop to execute again, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must still be true. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `right` is `right + 1` such that `func_1(right)` may or may not equal `m`, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the next iteration.

Looking at the provided states:
- `m` is unchanged.
- `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, but this does not directly affect the loop condition.
- `low` and `high` are unchanged, which does not directly impact the loop condition.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, but its value does not directly influence the loop condition.
- `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, which also does not directly affect the loop condition since it's about `right`.
- `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, not directly relevant to the loop condition.
- `result` is an empty list, which does not impact the loop condition.
- `right` is `right + 1`, and for the loop to continue, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.

Given that the loop's continuation depends solely on `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`, and `right` has been incremented, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that after incrementing `right`, `func_1(right)` still equals `m`. Since we do not have specific information about the behavior of `func_1`, we can only adjust our understanding of `right`'s relationship to `m`.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `func_1(right)` must equal `m` after `right` has been incremented. This implies that `right`'s new value, after being incremented, should still satisfy the equation `func_1(right) == m`.

State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` is such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
