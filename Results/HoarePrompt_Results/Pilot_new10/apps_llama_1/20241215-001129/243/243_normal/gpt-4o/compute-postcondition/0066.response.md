To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`.

According to the given state, `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`. Also, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, which means `mid` and `left` have the same value.

For the loop to execute at least one time, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must be true. Given that `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)` and `mid` equals `left`, it implies that `zeroes` should also equal `m` for the loop condition to be met.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`**
