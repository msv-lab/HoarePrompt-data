The variable `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The function `func_1(mid)` is not defined here, however `zeroes` is now equal to the output of `func_1(mid)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`.**
