Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is either `5 * (m + 1)` or `5 * m // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is more than or equal to `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is `5 * m // 2 + 1` and `result` is an empty list; otherwise, `left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the initial value of `m` (or `mid + 1` if no such value exists), and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.***
