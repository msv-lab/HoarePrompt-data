To calculate the result, we must consider the changes made by the given code snippet to the initial state.

Given the code:
```python
left -= 1
```

The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Initially, `left` was defined as `(low + high) // 2`, which also equals `mid`. After the decrement, `left` becomes `((low + high) // 2) - 1`.

The states of the other variables (`m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, 
`n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, 
`low` must be less than or equal to `high`, 
`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, 
`left` is `((low + high) // 2) - 1` and must produce `m` when passed through `func_1`, 
`zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, 
and `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `((low + high) // 2) - 1`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and `result` is an empty list**
