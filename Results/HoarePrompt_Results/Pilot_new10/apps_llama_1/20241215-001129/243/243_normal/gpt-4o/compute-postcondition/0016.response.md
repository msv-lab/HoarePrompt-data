To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `while func_1(left) == m`. The loop will execute as long as the condition `func_1(left) == m` is met.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `low` is `0`.
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`.
- `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`.
- `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is `5 * m // 2 + 1`.
- The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`.
- `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. Given that `left` is `5 * m // 2 + 1` and considering the constraints and the condition that must be satisfied for the loop to continue, the critical factor is the value of `func_1(left)` in relation to `m`.

Since we do not have the exact implementation of `func_1`, we rely on the given condition that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute. This implies that the loop's continuation depends solely on the relationship between `func_1(left)` and `m`, with all other variables providing context but not directly influencing the loop condition.

However, to ensure `func_1(left)` can equal `m` again (considering `left` is derived from `m`), we must consider the constraints on `m` and how `left` is calculated. Given `left` is `5 * m // 2 + 1`, for `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m` in the next iteration, `m` should remain within its defined bounds (`1 <= m <= 100000`), and the calculation of `left` should be such that it allows `func_1(left)` to potentially return `m`.

Given no specific details about `func_1` and its behavior, the primary adjustment needed for the loop to potentially execute one more time is not directly related to the values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, or `result`, but rather the relationship between `m` and `left` through `func_1`. The condition that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute suggests that as long as this condition can be met, the loop will continue.

Since we are to modify the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, and considering that the loop's execution depends on `func_1(left) == m`, without specific knowledge of `func_1`'s implementation, we rely on the condition itself. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * m // 2 + 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is such that `func_1(left)` can equal `m`, and the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` is less than or equal to `m`.**
