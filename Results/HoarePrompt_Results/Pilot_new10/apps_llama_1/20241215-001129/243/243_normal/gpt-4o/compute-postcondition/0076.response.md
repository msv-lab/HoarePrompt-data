To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the provided state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must still be true after the previous iteration. 

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`.
- `zeroes` equals `m`.
- `result` is an empty list `[]`.
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `right` equals `mid + 2`.

Since the loop condition depends only on `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`, we need to ensure this condition holds true for the next iteration.

After the last iteration, `right` equals `mid + 2`, but there is no direct information about `func_1(right)` in relation to `m` at this point. However, for the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`. 

Considering the state adjustments:
- The value of `left` and its relation to `m` through `func_1(left)` does not directly impact the loop condition since the condition depends on `func_1(right)`.
- The value of `zeroes` being equal to `m` does not impact the loop condition directly.
- The state of `result` as an empty list does not influence the loop condition.
- The nature of `m` and its calculation from `n` does not impact the loop's ability to execute again directly, as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`.
- The critical factor is `right` and its relation to `m` through `func_1(right)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to ensure that `func_1(right)` still equals `m`. Given `right` equals `mid + 2`, and there's no information provided that would inherently change the value of `func_1(right)` in relation to `m`, the primary adjustment needed is conceptual: we need to ensure that the conditions that make `func_1(right)` equal to `m` are still met.

However, based strictly on the information given and the format requested, since `right` equals `mid + 2` and this is the critical piece of information related to the loop condition, and without explicit details on how `func_1`, `mid`, or other variables directly influence the loop's continuation, the focus remains on ensuring `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to proceed.

State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, and `right` equals `mid + 2` and `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`**
