To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement: `while func_1(left) == m`. The loop will execute again if the condition `func_1(left) == m` is still met at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list `[]`.

The key to the loop's continuation is the function `func_1(left)` returning a value equal to `m`. Without the exact definition of `func_1`, we can infer that for the loop to execute again, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must still hold true.

Since `left` is defined as `(low + high) // 2 - 1` and is used in the function `func_1(left)`, for the loop to potentially execute again, the relationship between `low` and `high` must allow for `left` to be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` could still equal `m`. 

However, given that we do not have the specific implementation of `func_1`, we must assume that the only way for the loop to execute again is if the condition is still met with the current or potentially adjusted values of its parameters, in this case, `left`.

Thus, no specific adjustments can be made to `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `left`, `zeroes`, or `result` without knowing the specifics of `func_1`. The loop's continuation depends solely on whether `func_1(left)` can still return `m`, which suggests that `left` must be in a state where this is possible, but without the function's definition, we cannot accurately adjust `left` or any other variables.

Given this analysis and the information provided:
State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1` and must allow `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`**
