The value of `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and `result` is an empty list. `left` is now `(low + high) // 2`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and `result` is an empty list.**
