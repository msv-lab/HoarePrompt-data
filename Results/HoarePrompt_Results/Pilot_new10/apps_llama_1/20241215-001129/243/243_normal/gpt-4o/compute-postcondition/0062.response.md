The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is equal to `mid + 1`, `high` is greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` before the update of `low`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`.
