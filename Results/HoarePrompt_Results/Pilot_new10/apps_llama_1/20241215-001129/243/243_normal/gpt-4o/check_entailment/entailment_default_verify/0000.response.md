The original assessment is accurate. The provided code correctly implements the required functionality. 

The `func_1` function accurately calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number `n` by summing the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 less than or equal to `n`. This is a well-known method for calculating the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial, as it accounts for the factors of 5 that contribute to the trailing zeroes.

The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of `n` values that result in exactly `m` trailing zeroes. This approach is efficient and accurate, as it takes advantage of the fact that the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial increases monotonically with `n`. The function correctly handles the case where there are no `n` values that result in exactly `m` trailing zeroes, in which case it returns an empty list.

The output hints provided are consistent with the problem description and the code's functionality. They confirm that `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`, and that `func_2` returns a list of consecutive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
