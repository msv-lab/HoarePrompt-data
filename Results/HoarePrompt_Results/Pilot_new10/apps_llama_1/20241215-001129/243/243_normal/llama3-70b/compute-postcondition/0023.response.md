The code `ans.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. The value of `n` is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 1, `count` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, and if `n`/5^`count` is less than `m`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `count` is 1, `ans` is [1], and if 1/5^1 is less than `m`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
