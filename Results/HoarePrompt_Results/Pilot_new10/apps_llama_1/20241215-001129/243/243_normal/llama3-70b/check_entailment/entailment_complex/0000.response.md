Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The problem requires finding the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes, and then printing these integers in increasing order.

There are several issues with the program:

1.  The program does not correctly calculate the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial. The number of trailing zeroes in n! is determined by the number of factors of 5 in all the numbers from 1 to n, since 2 * 5 = 10, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5. The program does not take this into account.

2.  The while loop that calculates the count is not correct. It breaks when n // 5 ** count >= m, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The correct approach would be to calculate the number of factors of 5 in n! and compare it to m.

3.  The second while loop is also incorrect. It checks if n // 5 ** count < m and breaks the loop, which again does not make sense. The correct approach would be to calculate the number of factors of 5 in n! and compare it to m, and then add n to the result list if they are equal.

4.  The program does not handle cases where there are no integers n that satisfy the condition (i.e., when m is too large). In such cases, it should print 0.

Here's a correct implementation of the problem:

```python
def find_trailing_zeroes():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    result = []
    
    n = 1
    while True:
        # Calculate the number of trailing zeroes in n!
        zeroes = 0
        i = 5
        while n // i >= 1:
            zeroes += n // i
            i *= 5
        
        # Check if the number of trailing zeroes is equal to m
        if zeroes == m:
            result.append(n)
        elif zeroes > m:
            break
        
        n += 1
    
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

find_trailing_zeroes()
```

This program correctly calculates the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes, and prints these integers in increasing order. It handles cases where there are no such integers by printing 0.
