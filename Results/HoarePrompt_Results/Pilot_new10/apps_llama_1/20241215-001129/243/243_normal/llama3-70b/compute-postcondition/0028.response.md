The code `ans.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the end of the list `ans`. The initial state is: `n` is 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is [1]. 

Since the condition `n // 5` is not a complete condition and seems to be incomplete, we will consider the given code `ans.append(n)` regardless of the condition.

`ans` becomes [1, 2] after `n` is appended to it. The values of `n` and `count` are not changed by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is [1, 2].
Output State: **`n` is 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is [1, 2]**
