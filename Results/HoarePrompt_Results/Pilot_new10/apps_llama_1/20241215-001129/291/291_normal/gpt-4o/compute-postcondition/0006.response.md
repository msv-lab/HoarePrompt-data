The value of `b` is updated to `(n + a - 1) // a`. Given that `a` is 2, the new value of `b` becomes `(n + 2 - 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 2, `min_segments_needed` is `2 + 2n`, `a` is 2, `b` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `segments_needed` is `2 + 2n`**
