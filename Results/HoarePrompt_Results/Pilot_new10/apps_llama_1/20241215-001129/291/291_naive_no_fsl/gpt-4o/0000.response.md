Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires that we draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$ and find the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the provided function `func_1(n)` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments needed. 

For example, the case where $n=3$ does not work correctly with this program. 

The program tries to minimize the number of segments drawn by assuming the arrangement of squares as an $a \times b$ grid where $a \times b = n$, but it simply does not consider that there could be other arrangements that minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler. 

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to realize that the optimal arrangement of squares that minimizes the segments drawn is a grid with dimensions $a$ and $b$ such that $a \le b \le a + 1$. Also, the number of segments required to draw this grid is $2a + 2b - 2$. The provided program does not ensure that $a \le b \le a + 1$ and it does not correctly calculate the number of segments. 

Thus, this solution can be proven to be incorrect for certain cases, such as $n=3$, where a simple 1 by 3 arrangement (with 5 segments drawn) is optimal, but the provided function might return a value greater than 5 or less than 5. The reader should note, though, the minimum segments Sofia can draw is given by the mathematical formula $2\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil$ or $2\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1$ depending on whether $\sqrt{n}$ is an integer or not, a concept the given solution does not recognize or account for.
