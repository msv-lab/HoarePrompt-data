You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the volume of the bottle types. The problem states that a single bottle of type i has volume 2^i - 1 liters, but the program only checks up to i = n, where n is the number of types of bottles. However, the problem description allows for larger bottle types to be used if they are available.

To fix this, the program should check all possible bottle types up to a certain limit, not just the types available in the store. This can be done by changing the line `for j in range(n):` to `for j in range(31):` to check all possible bottle types up to 2^30 - 1 liters.

Here is an example of when the program does not work correctly:

Input:
5 29
10 100 1000 10000 100000
Output:
410
Expected Output:
30

The program does not consider buying a 31-liter bottle (2^5 - 1 = 31), which would be more expensive than buying a 1-liter bottle, 3 7-liter bottles, and 1 15-liter bottle. However, buying a 1-liter bottle, 3 7-liter bottles, and 1 15-liter bottle would require 3 different types of bottles (1, 7, 15), but there is a cheaper option which is buying one 2^5 - 1 liter bottle which is not considered in the given program.

So the program does not work correctly for all cases. The provided code only checks the available bottle types in the store, but it should consider all possible bottle types up to a certain limit. 

However, the algorithm can be fixed by using a different approach. Instead of iterating through all the liters from 1 to L, we can use a greedy approach to try to use the largest bottle type possible to minimize the total cost. This approach will ensure that we consider all possible bottle types, not just the ones available in the store. 

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_cost = 0
    i = n - 1
    while L > 0 and i >= 0:
        vol = 2 ** (i+1) - 1
        if vol <= L:
            count = L // vol
            total_cost += count * costs[i]
            L -= count * vol
        i -= 1
    if L > 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(total_cost)
```
This code uses a greedy approach to try to use the largest bottle type possible to minimize the total cost. It iterates through the available bottle types in descending order and uses as many of each type as possible to minimize the remaining volume. This approach ensures that we consider all possible bottle types, not just the ones available in the store.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function calculates the minimum cost to make a specified amount of lemonade using bottles of different volumes and costs, and returns the minimum cost if possible, or -1 if it is impossible to make the specified amount of lemonade. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
