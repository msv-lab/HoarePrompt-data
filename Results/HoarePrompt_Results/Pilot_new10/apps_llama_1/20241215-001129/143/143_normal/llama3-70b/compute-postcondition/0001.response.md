The given code snippet takes the number of types of bottles and the required amount of lemonade as input, but these values are already stored in the variables `n` and `L` respectively. The new code snippet is taking another input which will be split into integers and stored in the list `costs`. 

The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), and the value of `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The `costs` list will store `n` integers representing the costs of different types of bottles.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers**
