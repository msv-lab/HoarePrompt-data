According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is between 1 and 30 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` becomes 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 0, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then the state of the program variables remains unchanged, specifically `dp[1]` remains as infinity**
