To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive).
   - `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
   - `costs` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `vol` is 3.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])` updates the value of `dp[i]`.
   - Given `i = 1` and `vol = 3`, `i - vol` would be `-2`. This implies that `dp[-2]` needs to exist, which typically would not be the case in a standard list or array indexing starting from 0. However, since we are dealing with dynamic programming (`dp`) and the specifics of `dp`'s initialization are not provided, we'll proceed under the assumption that `dp` is defined and accessible for the required indices.
   - `dp[i]` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and the sum of `dp[i - vol]` (which is `dp[-2]`) and `costs[j]` (where `j = 2`, so it's the third element in `costs`).

3. **Impact on State**:
   - The values of `n`, `L`, `costs`, `i`, `j`, and `vol` do not change.
   - `dp[i]` (specifically `dp[1]`) is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[-2] + costs[2]`.
   - The list `dp` is affected, but since we don't have its initial values, we can only describe the change for `dp[1]`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive).
   - `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
   - `costs` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `vol` is 3.
   - `dp[1]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[-2] + costs[2]`.

Given the specifics of the task and the code provided, the output state must be described with the understanding that `dp`'s structure and initial values are not fully defined but that `dp[1]` has been updated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3, and `dp[1]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[-2] + costs[2]`.**
