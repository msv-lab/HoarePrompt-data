To calculate the result, let's first understand the given initial state and the provided code snippet. 

- The initial state provides the following information: 
  - `i` is `L + 1`
  - `L` is greater than the previous `L`
  - `n` is greater than 1
  - `j` is 1

- The code snippet is: `vol = 2 ** j - 1`

Now, we'll list the impact of the code on the program:

1. `vol` is assigned a new value based on `j`.
2. Since `j` is 1, `2 ** j` equals `2 ** 1`, which is 2.
3. Therefore, `vol = 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `vol = 1`.

The states of `i`, `L`, `n`, and `j` are not affected by the code snippet. 

So, considering all the information:

- `i` remains `L + 1`
- `L` is still greater than the previous `L`
- `n` is still greater than 1
- `j` is still 1
- `vol` is now 1

Output State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is greater than the previous `L`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
