Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 3. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[1]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[-2] + costs[2]`. Since `vol` (3) is greater than `i` (1), no update occurs.***
