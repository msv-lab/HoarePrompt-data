The function `func` accepts no parameters but takes input from two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `L`, where `n` is the number of types of bottles in the store and `L` is the required amount of lemonade in liters. The second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2,..., c_{n}`, where `c_i` is the cost of a bottle of type `i` with volume `2^{i} - 1` liters. 

After executing the function body, the return value is not specified. Therefore, I will assume the return value is based on the given input and the goal is to determine the minimum cost to make `L` liters of lemonade using the given bottles.


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but takes input of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `L`, and the second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2,..., c_{n}`, then returns a value based on the minimum cost to make `L` liters of lemonade.**
