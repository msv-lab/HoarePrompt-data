The code sets the value of `dp[0]` to 0. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are initialized with infinity**
