The value of `vol` is updated to `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 2, `vol` becomes `2 ** 2 - 1` which equals `4 - 1` and that is `3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive) and `n` must be greater than 2, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `vol` is `3`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3**
