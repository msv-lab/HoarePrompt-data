According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `vol` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
