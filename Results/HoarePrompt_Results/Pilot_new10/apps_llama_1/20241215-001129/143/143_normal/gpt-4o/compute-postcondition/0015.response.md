The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Since `i` is 3, `dp[3]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `dp[2] * 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * dp[0]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * min(dp[0] * 2, dp[1])`, and `dp[3]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * dp[2]`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`, and `i` is 3.
