The given code initializes a list `dp` with 31 elements, each set to the value of `max_cost`. The initial state provides specific constraints for the variables `n`, `L`, `costs`, and `max_cost`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30.
- `L` is an integer such that 1 <= L <= 10^9.
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that 1 <= cost <= 10^9.
- `max_cost` is equal to 10^18.

The code `dp = [max_cost] * 31` only affects the variable `dp`, which is assigned a new list of 31 elements, all initialized to `max_cost` (10^18). The other variables (`n`, `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 <= L <= 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that 1 <= cost <= 10^9, `max_cost` equals 10^18, and `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all equal to 10^18.**
