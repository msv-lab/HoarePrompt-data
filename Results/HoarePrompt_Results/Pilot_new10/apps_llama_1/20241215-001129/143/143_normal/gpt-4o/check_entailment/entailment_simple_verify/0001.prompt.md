You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. 

The main issue with the given code is that it does not correctly implement a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade. 

One of the cases where the code does not work as expected is when the cost of a larger bottle is not the minimum cost to buy that amount of lemonade. The code does not consider the possibility that buying multiple smaller bottles might be cheaper than buying a single larger bottle.

For example, consider the case where n = 3, L = 7, and the costs are [10, 20, 100]. In this case, the code will choose to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 100 roubles, but the optimal solution would be to buy one 4-liter bottle for 20 roubles and three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, resulting in a total cost of 50 roubles. 

This example shows that the code does not work correctly for all possible inputs, so its correctness is **False**. 

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm that considers all possible combinations of bottles would be needed. 

Here is an example of how the problem can be solved using bit manipulation and dynamic programming:

```python
def min_cost(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            volume = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1
            if i >= volume:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - volume] + costs[j])
    return dp[L]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cost(n, L, costs))
```
This code maintains a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy `i` liters of lemonade. It then iterates through all possible volumes of lemonade and updates the `dp` array accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum cost to buy `L` liters of lemonade.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30, L is an integer such that 1 <= L <= 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each integer is a cost such that 1 <= cost <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the rest equal `10^18`, and `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)

    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is 0, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, `i` is -1, `answer` is the minimum cost that can be achieved by subtracting powers of 2 from the original value of `L` and adding the corresponding values from the `dp` list, and `current_cost` is the sum of the values from the `dp` list that correspond to the powers of 2 that were subtracted from the original value of `L`.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost that can be achieved by subtracting powers of 2 from the original value of `L` (which is 0) and adding the corresponding values from the `dp` list, where `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, and the original costs are from the list `costs` with `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
