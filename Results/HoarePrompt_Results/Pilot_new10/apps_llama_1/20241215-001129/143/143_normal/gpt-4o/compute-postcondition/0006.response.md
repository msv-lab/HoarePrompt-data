The code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `c[i]`. 

Given that `i` is 1, `dp[1]` will be updated to be the minimum of its current value (`10^18`) and `c[1]` (which is `costs[1]`). 

Since `1 <= costs[1] <= 10^9`, `dp[1]` will be updated to `costs[1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[0]` equals `costs[0]` and `dp[1]` equals `costs[1]` and the rest equal `10^18`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[0]` equals `costs[0]` and `dp[1]` equals `costs[1]` and the rest equal `10^18`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`, and `i` is 1**
