The value of `current_cost` is increased by `dp[i]`. The value of `dp[i]` is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled. Given `i` is 30, `dp[i]` is `dp[30]`. Since `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, and `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `dp[30]` will be `max_cost` because `i` (30) is greater than or equal to `n`. `max_cost` equals `10^18`. Therefore, `current_cost` becomes `0 + dp[30] = 0 + 10^18 = 10^18`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, 
`L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9` and `L >= 1 << 30`, 
`costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, 
`max_cost` equals `10^18`, 
`dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, 
`c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, 
`answer` is `10^18`, 
`current_cost` is `10^18`, 
and `i` is 30.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9` and `L >= 1 << 30`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, `answer` is `10^18`, `current_cost` is `10^18`, and `i` is 30**
