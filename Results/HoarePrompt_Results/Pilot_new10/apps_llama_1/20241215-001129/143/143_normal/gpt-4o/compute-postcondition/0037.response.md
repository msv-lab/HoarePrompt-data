The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). After executing the function body, the function returns the minimum cost that can be achieved by subtracting powers of 2 from the original value of `L` and adding the corresponding values from a calculated list based on the provided `costs`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, L, and costs, and returns the minimum cost achievable based on subtracting powers of 2 from L and adding corresponding minimum costs from the provided list of costs.**
