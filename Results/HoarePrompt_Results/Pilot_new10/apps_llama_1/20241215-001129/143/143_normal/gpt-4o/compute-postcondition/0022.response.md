To calculate the result of the given Python code, we need to understand what the code does and how it affects the variables.

The given code is:
```
L -= 1 << i
```
Here, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9` and `L >= 1 << 30`, and `i` is 30.

First, let's calculate `1 << i`. This is equivalent to `1` shifted left by `i` bits, which is equal to `2` raised to the power of `i`. So, `1 << 30` is equal to `2 ^ 30` or `1073741824`.

Now, let's calculate `L -= 1 << i`. This is equivalent to `L = L - 1 << i` or `L = L - 1073741824`.

The value of `L` after the execution of the code will be `L - 1073741824`. 

Since `L >= 1 << 30` initially, `L - 1073741824` will be greater than or equal to `0`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, 
`L` is an integer such that `L = L_original - 1073741824` where `L_original` is the original value of `L`, 
`costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, 
`max_cost` equals `10^18`, 
`dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, 
`c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, 
`answer` is `10^18`, 
`current_cost` is `10^18`, and 
`i` is 30.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `L = L_original - 1073741824` where `L_original` is the original value of `L`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, `answer` is `10^18`, `current_cost` is `10^18`, and `i` is 30**
