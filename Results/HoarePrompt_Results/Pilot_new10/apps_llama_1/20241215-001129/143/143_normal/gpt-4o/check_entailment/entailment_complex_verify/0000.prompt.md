You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly in all cases. It has several issues. The main issue is that the dynamic programming (DP) approach used is not suitable for this problem. The DP array is initialized with a large value, and then the costs are updated, but the logic of updating the costs and calculating the answer is incorrect.

One possible issue is that the program assumes that the cost of buying a bottle of a certain type is always less than or equal to the cost of buying two bottles of a smaller type. However, this assumption is not always true.

Another issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case where the required amount of lemonade is less than the volume of the smallest bottle. In this case, the program should simply return the cost of the smallest bottle, but the program does not do this correctly.

For example, if the input is:

```
1 1
10
```

The program should return `10`, but it may return a different value.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a different approach, such as a greedy algorithm or a more complex dynamic programming approach.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    memo = {}
    def dp(L):
        if L in memo:
            return memo[L]
        if L == 0:
            return 0
        res = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            if (1 << i) - 1 <= L:
                res = min(res, costs[i] + dp(L - (1 << i) + 1))
        memo[L] = res
        return res
    return dp(L)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30, L is an integer such that 1 <= L <= 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each integer is a cost such that 1 <= cost <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the rest equal `10^18`, and `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, and `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is 0, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, `i` is -1, `answer` is the minimum cost that can be achieved by subtracting powers of 2 from the original value of `L` and adding the corresponding values from the `dp` list, and `current_cost` is the sum of the values from the `dp` list that correspond to the powers of 2 that were subtracted from the original value of `L`.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost that can be achieved by subtracting powers of 2 from the original value of `L` (which is 0) and adding the corresponding values from the `dp` list, where `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, and the original costs are from the list `costs` with `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n, L, and costs, and returns the minimum cost achievable by subtracting powers of 2 from L and adding the corresponding minimum costs from the provided list of costs, with potential errors or incorrect results for inputs outside the specified ranges or for invalid input types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
