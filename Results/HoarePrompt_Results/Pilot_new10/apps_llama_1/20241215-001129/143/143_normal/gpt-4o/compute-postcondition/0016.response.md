To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(1, 31):
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
```
This loop iterates over the range from 1 to 30 (inclusive) and updates the `dp` list at each index `i` with the minimum value between its current value and twice the value at the previous index (`dp[i - 1] * 2`).

From the given output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

- The value of `dp[i]` after each iteration is the minimum between its original value and twice the minimum value of `dp[i - 1]`.
- The values of `n`, `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, and `c` remain unchanged throughout the iterations of the loop.
- The loop does not modify `n`, `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, or `c`, so their final state will be the same as their initial state.

Considering the loop code and the observed patterns, after all 30 iterations, `dp[i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to 30 will have been updated to be the minimum between their original values and the doubling of the minimum value of the previous `dp` element. For the elements in `dp` where `i` is greater than `n`, since their original values are `10^18` (a very large number), unless `n` is 30 and the costs are such that a smaller value than `10^18` is propagated through the doubling and min operations, these values will remain `10^18`. However, since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `30`, and each `dp[i]` is compared with `dp[i - 1] * 2`, the minimum values will propagate forward.

If `n` is 0, the loop still executes 30 times because its range is independent of `n`. In this case, `dp[0]` is the first cost (which doesn't exist, so we consider it as an edge case where `dp[0]` might be considered as a very large number or an initial condition not directly stated), but since the initial state of `dp` for indices greater than `n` is `10^18`, and the loop updates `dp[i]` based on `dp[i - 1]`, the values will be updated according to the rule but starting from an initial condition that isn't directly a cost from `costs` but rather the minimum between a cost (if `n > 0`) and twice the previous minimum.

Given this analysis, the final output state of the loop after all iterations will be:

- `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`.
- `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`.
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`.
- `max_cost` equals `10^18`.
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each `dp[i]` (for `1 <= i <= 30`) is the minimum between its original value (from `costs` if `i <= n`, or `10^18` if `i > n`) and the minimum of all `dp[j] * 2` for `j < i`. If `n` is 0, the initial `dp[0]` isn't directly provided, but the update rule applies starting from `i = 1`.
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, and `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`.**
