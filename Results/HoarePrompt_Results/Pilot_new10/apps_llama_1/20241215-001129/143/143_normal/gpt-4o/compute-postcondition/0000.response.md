The code assigns a value to the variable `max_cost`, setting it equal to 10^18. The values of `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 <= L <= 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that 1 <= cost <= 10^9, and `max_cost` is equal to 10^18**
