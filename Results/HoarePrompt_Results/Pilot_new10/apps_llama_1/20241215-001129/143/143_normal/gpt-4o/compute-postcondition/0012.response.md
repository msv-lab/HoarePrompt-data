According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 31, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. So, `i` should be 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * dp[0]` and the rest of the `dp` list remains unchanged, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`, and `i` is 2**
