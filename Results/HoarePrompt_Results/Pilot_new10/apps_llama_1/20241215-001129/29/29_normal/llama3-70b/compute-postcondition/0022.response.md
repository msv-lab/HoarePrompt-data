To determine the loop's output state after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i, file in enumerate(examples, start=1):
    script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
```
This loop iterates over the `examples` list, which contains filenames from the `files` list where the type is 1. For each filename, it appends a string to the `script` list in the format `f'move {file} {i}'`, where `i` is the index of the filename in the `examples` list, starting from 1.

From the output states for the first few iterations, we can see that:

* `n` remains the same, an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
* `name` and `type_` remain the same, the last filename and type read, respectively.
* `files` remains the same, a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types.
* `_` remains the same, the last index value of `n-1`.
* `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, and its length determines the number of iterations.
* `regular` remains the same, a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0.
* `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'`, where `file` is each filename in the `examples` list, and `i` is the index of the filename in the `examples` list, starting from 1.
* `i` is the index of the last filename in the `examples` list, and `file` is the last filename in the `examples` list.

If the `examples` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the `script` list will remain empty.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples`, `i` is the length of `examples` if `examples` is not empty, otherwise `i` is not defined, and `file` is the last filename in `examples` if `examples` is not empty, otherwise `file` is not defined.**
