The code `name, type_ = input().split()` splits the input into two parts, a string `name` and an integer `type_`, based on the space separator. 

The value of `name` is assigned the value of the filename from the input and `type_` is assigned the value of the integer type from the input.

`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive) and it remains the same. 

`files` is an empty list and it remains the same. 

`_` is undefined and it remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is a string filename from the input, `type_` is an integer type from the input, `files` is an empty list, `_` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is a string filename from the input, `type_` is an integer type from the input, `files` is an empty list, `_` is undefined**
