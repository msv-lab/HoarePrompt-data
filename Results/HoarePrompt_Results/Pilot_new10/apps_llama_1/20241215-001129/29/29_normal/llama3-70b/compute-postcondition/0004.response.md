The code `files.append((name, int(type_)))` appends a tuple to the `files` list. The tuple contains the `name` and the integer value of `type_`. 

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `name` also remains unchanged. The value of `type_` is converted to an integer, but since `type_` is already an integer, its value remains the same. The value of `files` changes as a new tuple is appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is a string filename from the input, `type_` is an integer type from the input, `files` is a list containing a tuple (`name`, `type_`), `_` is undefined**
