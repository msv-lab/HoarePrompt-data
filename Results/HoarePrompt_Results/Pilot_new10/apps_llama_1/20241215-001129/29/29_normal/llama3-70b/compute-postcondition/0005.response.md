According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), and `_` has completed one iteration. For the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented to the next iteration, so `_` is now the second iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is a string filename from the input, `type_` is an integer type from the input, `files` is a list containing at least one tuple (`name`, `type_`), `_` is 1**
