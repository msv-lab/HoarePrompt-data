To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the provided loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i, file in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
```
From this code, we can see that the loop iterates over the `regular` list, which contains filenames where the type is 0. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index `i` and the value `file` of each item in the `regular` list. The `start` parameter is set to `len(examples) + 1`, which means that the index `i` will start from the length of the `examples` list plus 1.

The loop appends a string to the `script` list in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in the `regular` list.

Now, let's analyze the output states after a few iterations:

* After 1 iteration: `regular` must have at least 1 filename, `script` contains strings for each filename in `examples` and the first filename in `regular`, `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, and `file` is the first filename in `regular`.
* After 2 iterations: `regular` must have at least 2 filenames, `script` contains strings for each filename in `examples` and the first two filenames in `regular`, `i` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `file` is the second filename in `regular`.
* After 3 iterations: `regular` must have at least 3 filenames, `script` contains strings for each filename in `examples` and the first three filenames in `regular`, `i` is `len(examples) + 3`, and `file` is the third filename in `regular`.

From these output states, we can see a pattern:

* `regular` must have at least `n` filenames, where `n` is the number of iterations.
* `script` contains strings for each filename in `examples` and the first `n` filenames in `regular`.
* `i` is `len(examples) + n`, where `n` is the number of iterations.
* `file` is the `n`-th filename in `regular`, where `n` is the number of iterations.

Now, let's consider what happens after all iterations of the loop have finished:

* If `regular` is not empty, the loop will execute for each filename in `regular`. The `script` list will contain strings for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`. The `i` variable will be set to `len(examples) + len(regular)`, and the `file` variable will be set to the last filename in `regular`.
* If `regular` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the `script` list will only contain strings for each filename in `examples`. The `i` variable will not be defined, and the `file` variable will not be defined.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)` if `regular` is not empty, otherwise `i` is not defined, and `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty, otherwise `file` is not defined.**
