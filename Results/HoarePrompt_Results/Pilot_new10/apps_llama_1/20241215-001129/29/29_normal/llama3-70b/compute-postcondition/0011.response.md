To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the provided information and the loop code.

The loop code reads:
```python
for _ in range(n):
    name, type_ = input().split()
    files.append((name, int(type_)))
```
From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe the following:

- `n` remains constant throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop. It is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `name` and `type_` are temporary variables that take on the values of the filename and type from the input at each iteration, respectively. After the loop, `name` will hold the filename from the last input, and `type_` will hold the type from the last input.
- `files` starts as an empty list and gets appended with tuples of `(name, type_)` at each iteration. After the loop, `files` will contain `n` tuples, each corresponding to a filename and type from the input.
- `_` is a throwaway variable used to ignore the loop index. Its value after the loop is `n-1`, as it is incremented at each iteration.

Given this analysis, we can determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

If the loop executes (which it will, since `n` is between 1 and 10^5), the final output state will be:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), which is its original value.
- `name` is the filename from the last input.
- `type_` is the type from the last input.
- `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, each corresponding to a filename and type from the input.
- `_` is `n-1`.

However, since we're focused on the final state without considering the intermediate steps in detail, but rather understanding what the variables will hold after all iterations or if the loop doesn't execute (which, based on the given conditions, it always will since `n` is between 1 and 10^5), we simplify the output state to reflect the essence of what the loop achieves:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types, `_` is undefined in terms of its conventional use but technically holds the last index value of `n-1`.**
