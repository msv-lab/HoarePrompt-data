The code appends a new string to the `script` list. The string is in the format 'move {file} {i}', where `file` is the third filename in the `examples` list and `i` is 3. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), 
`name` is still the last filename read, 
`type_` is still the last type read, 
`files` is still a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, 
`_` is still the last index value of `n-1`, 
`examples` is still a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1 and must have at least 3 filenames, 
`regular` is still a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, 
`script` now contains three strings: 
    f'move {first filename in examples list} 1', 
    f'move {second filename in examples list} 2', and 
    f'move {third filename in examples list} 3', 
`i` is still 3, 
`file` is still the third filename in the `examples` list.
