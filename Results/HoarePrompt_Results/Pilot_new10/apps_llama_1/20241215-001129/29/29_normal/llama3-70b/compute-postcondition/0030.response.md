To determine the output state, we analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(len(script))
```
Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `name` is the last filename read
- `type_` is the last type read
- `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types
- `_` is the last index value of `n-1`
- `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1
- `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0
- `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`
- `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)` if `regular` is not empty, otherwise `i` is not defined
- `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty, otherwise `file` is not defined

The code `print(len(script))` prints the length of the `script` list, which means it prints the total number of move commands generated for both examples and regular files.

Since `script` contains a string for each filename in `examples` and `regular`, the length of `script` is equal to the total number of filenames in `examples` and `regular`. Thus, `len(script)` equals `len(examples) + len(regular)`.

The variable `i`, if defined, also equals `len(examples) + len(regular)`. Therefore, if `regular` is not empty, `i` equals `len(script)`.

The output of `print(len(script))` will be the length of `script`, which is a specific number but its exact value depends on the contents of `examples` and `regular`. However, since we are asked to provide the output state, and given that `len(script)` is the same as `len(examples) + len(regular)`, we understand that no variable's value is changed by this print statement, but the output (which is not a variable state) will be this length.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`, `i` equals `len(script)` if `regular` is not empty, otherwise `i` is not defined, `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty, otherwise `file` is not defined, and the value `len(examples) + len(regular)` has been printed**
