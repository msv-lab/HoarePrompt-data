Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not work correctly in all potential cases. It attempts to move each file to its corresponding number based on its type (example or regular test), but it doesn't handle cases where a file with the target name already exists.

For example, consider a case where the input is:

```
2
1 0
2 1
```

The program will output:

```
4
move 2 1
move 1 2
move 2 2
move 1 3
```

However, this is not a valid script because it tries to move file "1" to "2" after it has already moved file "2" to "1". This is not a valid operation because the file "2" no longer exists.

The correct output for this case should be:

```
3
move 1 3
move 2 1
move 3 2
```

The program does not handle such cases correctly, and therefore its correctness is **False**.

The correct approach to solve this problem would be to first move all files to temporary locations, then move them to their final locations. This way, we avoid conflicts between file names. 

Here is a correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    
    # create a temporary location for each file
    temp_locations = [f"temp_{i}" for i in range(len(examples) + len(regular))]
    
    # move each file to its temporary location
    script = []
    for i, file in enumerate(examples + regular):
        script.append(f"move {file} {temp_locations[i]}")
    
    # move each file from its temporary location to its final location
    for i, file in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f"move {temp_locations[i-1]} {i}")
    for i, file in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f"move {temp_locations[i-1]} {i}")
    
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)

```
