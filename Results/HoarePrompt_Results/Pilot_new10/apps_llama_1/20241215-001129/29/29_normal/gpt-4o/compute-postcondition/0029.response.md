To calculate the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element.
- `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0".
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed.
- `moves` is an empty list.
- `temp_counter` is `n + 3`.
- `i` is 0.
- `files_set` must contain the string representations of `n + 1`, `n + 2`, and `n + 4`.

The code snippet increments `temp_counter` by 1:
```python
temp_counter += 1
```

Given that `temp_counter` initially is `n + 3`, after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes `n + 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 4`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state is as follows:

- `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element.
- `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0".
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed.
- `moves` is an empty list.
- `temp_counter` is `n + 4`.
- `i` is 0.
- `files_set` must contain the string representations of `n + 1`, `n + 2`, and `n + 4`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 4`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representations of `n + 1`, `n + 2`, and `n + 4`.**
