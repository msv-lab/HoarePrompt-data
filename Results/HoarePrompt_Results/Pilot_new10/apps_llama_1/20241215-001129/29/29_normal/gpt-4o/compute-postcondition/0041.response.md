To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`, because if it exceeds this value, the loop condition will be false. Thus, `temp_counter` should be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - It is given that `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter - 1)` and `str(temp_counter)`. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to check if `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set` because `temp_counter` will increment by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `files_set` must also contain `str(temp_counter + 1)`.

No adjustments are needed for `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, or `i`, as the loop condition does not directly depend on these variables.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `str(temp_counter)`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)`**
