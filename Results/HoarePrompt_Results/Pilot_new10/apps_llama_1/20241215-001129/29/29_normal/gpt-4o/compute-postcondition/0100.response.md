`moves` is appended with the string 'move {regulars[i]} {target}'. The string representation of `target` is `str(len(examples) + 2)`, but `regulars[i]` is not equal to this string representation. Therefore, `moves` now has an additional string element 'move {regulars[i]} {len(examples) + 2}'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, and `moves` is a list with an additional string element 'move {regulars[i]} {len(examples) + 2}'**
