To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **`temp_counter <= 2 * n`**: For this condition to be true, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, this means `temp_counter` should be within the range that allows it to be at most `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is either the original `temp_counter` or `temp_counter + 1`, and we are considering the state right before the loop, `temp_counter` can be at most `2 * n` for the loop to potentially execute. However, since we are looking at the condition for the loop to execute "one more time," `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` to allow for at least one iteration.

2. **`str(temp_counter) in files_set`**: This condition requires that the string representation of `temp_counter` is present in `files_set`. Since `files` is a list of `n` tuples and we are not provided with how `files_set` is created, we must infer that for `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`, the set must contain string values that correspond to the indices or related values that `temp_counter` could represent.

Given these conditions, to ensure the loop can execute one more time:

- `n` being a positive integer already satisfies part of the condition for the first part of the `while` loop condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`), as it sets an upper limit that can be reached.
- `temp_counter` must be such that it is less than or equal to `2 * n` but also must have a string representation that is in `files_set`. Given that `temp_counter` is either its original value or incremented by 1, and it must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, the state of `temp_counter` itself does not need adjustment in terms of its possible range, but it does need to have a corresponding string representation in `files_set`.
- `files` being a list of `n` tuples and `files_set` needing to contain `str(temp_counter)` implies that `files_set` must be constructed in a way that includes values that can match `str(temp_counter)`. This does not directly affect the state variables given but implies a relationship between `files`, `files_set`, and the values that `temp_counter` can take.

Thus, the adjustments needed are more about ensuring that the conditions can be met given the current states, rather than altering the states themselves, except for the implicit understanding that `files_set` must contain a string representation of a value that `temp_counter` can take.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is updated according to the loop body's logic, `temp_counter` is either the original `temp_counter` or `temp_counter + 1` and must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
