The code `examples.append(name)` modifies the list `examples` by adding the value of `name` to it.

Initially, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` and `regulars` is an empty list. After the code execution, `examples` will be a list containing at least two occurrences of `name`.

If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing `name`. After the code execution, `examples` will be a list containing `name`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is an empty list, otherwise, `examples` is a list containing `name` and `regulars` is a list containing `name`**
