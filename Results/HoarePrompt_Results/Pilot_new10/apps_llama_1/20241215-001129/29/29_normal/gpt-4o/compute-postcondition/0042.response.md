The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`. The condition that `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `str(temp_counter)`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is still valid, but now it contains `str((temp_counter + 1) - 1)`, `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and `str((temp_counter + 1) + 1)`, which simplifies to `str(temp_counter)`, `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and `str(temp_counter + 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and equals to `temp_counter + 1`, and `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`, `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and `str(temp_counter + 2)`**
