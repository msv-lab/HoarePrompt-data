To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

From the given state, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than the last string found in `files_set` that is less than or equal to `2 * n`, plus one, or `2 * n + 1` if all numbers up to `2 * n` are found in `files_set`, plus one.
- `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, with the current value of `regulars` at index `i` (which is 0) not equal to the string representation of `target`.

For the loop to execute one more time, two conditions must be met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` is defined as the smallest value greater than the last string found in `files_set` that is less than or equal to `2 * n`, plus one, or `2 * n + 1` if all numbers up to `2 * n` are found in `files_set`, plus one, the first condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`) is inherently satisfied by the definition of `temp_counter` unless `temp_counter` is exactly `2 * n + 1`, which happens when all numbers up to `2 * n` are found in `files_set`. However, for the loop to execute, `str(temp_counter)` must also be in `files_set`, which implies that `temp_counter` cannot be `2 * n + 1` because it's defined to be such when all numbers up to `2 * n` are in `files_set`, implying `2 * n + 1` would not be in `files_set` under the described conditions.

Therefore, the critical adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter`'s definition ensures it is either within the range of `2 * n` or is `2 * n + 1` when all previous numbers are in `files_set`, and since the loop condition also requires `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`, we must ensure that there is at least one value that satisfies both conditions.

Given the state definitions and the loop condition, no additional adjustments to the states of `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `moves`, `i`, and `target` are explicitly required for the loop to potentially execute one more time, other than ensuring that `temp_counter`'s string representation is in `files_set`, which is implicit in the loop's condition and `temp_counter`'s definition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list where each element is either its original value if no move was necessary or the result of the last move operation if a move was necessary, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0" that must have at least 1 element, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is a list of move commands executed during the loop, `temp_counter` is such that its string representation must be in `files_set`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`.**
