You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct. It follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program first separates the files into examples and regulars based on their types. Then, it iterates over the examples and regulars, checking if their names match the expected names (1 to e for examples and e+1 to n for regulars). If a file's name does not match the expected name, the program generates a temporary name by incrementing a counter until it finds an available name. It then moves the file to the temporary name and finally moves it to the expected name.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* Files with names that are not integers
* Files with names that are not in the expected range (1 to n)
* Files with duplicate names
* Empty sets of examples or regulars

The program also generates the minimum number of moves required to rename the files correctly.

All the provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the program, and no potential case was found where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and files is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (either "0" for a regular test or "1" for an example test), such that the filenames are distinct and the number of files is equal to n.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is a positive integer.
    #   - `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type ("0" for regular test or "1" for example test).
    #   - `examples` and `regulars` are empty lists.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each file in `files`.
    #   - For each file, it splits the file into `name` and `type_`.
    #   - If `type_` is "1", it appends `name` to `examples`.
    #   - If `type_` is not "1", it appends `name` to `regulars`.
    #
    #Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see patterns emerging:
    #- `files` must have at least as many tuples as the number of times the loop executes.
    #- `name` and `type_` are derived from the current `file` being processed.
    #- `examples` and `regulars` are populated based on the `type_` of each file.
    #
    #Considering the loop will execute `n` times (since `n` is the number of tuples in `files`), after all iterations:
    #- `n` remains a positive integer, as it's not modified by the loop.
    #- `files` remains a list of `n` tuples, as it's not modified by the loop, just iterated over.
    #- `file` will be the last file in the list after the loop finishes, as it takes on the value of the current file in each iteration.
    #- `name` and `type_` will be the filename and type of the last file in the list, respectively.
    #- `examples` will be a list containing the filenames of all files where `type_` was "1".
    #- `regulars` will be a list containing the filenames of all files where `type_` was not "1".
    #
    #If the loop does not execute (which contradicts the given that `n` is a positive integer and thus the loop must execute at least once), `examples` and `regulars` would remain empty lists, as they are only modified within the loop.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", and `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed.**

If `regulars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the variables retain their original values.
    return moves
    #The program returns a list of move commands, 'moves', that were performed during the loop, where the loop iterates over a list of 'n' tuples, 'files', with 'n' being a positive integer, and the loop's execution is dependent on the 'regulars' list not being empty, and 'regulars' is a list of strings where each element is 'str(len(examples) + i + 1)' for 'i' in the range of 'len(regulars)'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
