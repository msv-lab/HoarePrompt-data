Based on the provided loop code and the output states after executing some number of times, we can determine the final output state of the loop.

The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`. In each iteration, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.

Considering the conditions for the loop to execute, we can see that `temp_counter` will keep incrementing until it exceeds `2 * n` or its string representation is no longer in `files_set`.

The output state after the loop executes is independent of the values of `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `moves`, `i`, and `target`, as these variables do not affect the loop condition.

The only variables that matter for the loop condition are `temp_counter` and `n`. After the loop finishes executing, `temp_counter` will be either greater than `2 * n` or its string representation will not be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `n` retains its original value as a positive integer**
