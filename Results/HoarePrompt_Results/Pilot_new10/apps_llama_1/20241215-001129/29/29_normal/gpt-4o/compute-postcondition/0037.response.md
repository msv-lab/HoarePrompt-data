Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `i` is 0. If `examples[0]` is not equal to '1', then `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `moves` contains the strings f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}' and f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {1}' where `str(temp_counter - 1)` was the previous value of `examples[0]`, and `examples[0]` is not equal to '1'. If `examples[0]` is equal to '1', then the state remains unchanged.***
