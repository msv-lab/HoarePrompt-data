The value of `target` is updated to `len(examples) + i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `target` becomes `len(examples) + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `len(examples) + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is updated according to the loop body's logic, `temp_counter` is either the original `temp_counter` or `temp_counter + 1` based on the condition in the loop body, `i` is 1, and `target` is `len(examples) + 2`**
