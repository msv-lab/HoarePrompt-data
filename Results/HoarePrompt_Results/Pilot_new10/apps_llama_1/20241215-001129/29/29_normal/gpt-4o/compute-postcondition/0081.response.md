The code increments the value of `temp_counter` by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was the smallest integer greater than the highest integer whose string representation is in `files_set` but not exceeding `2 * n`, or `2 * n + 1` if all such integers are in `files_set`. 

The new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples`, `regulars` is a list where `regulars[0]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `file`, `name`, `type_` retain their values, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, and `moves` is the previous list with an additional element `f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}'`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples`, `regulars` is a list where `regulars[0]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `file`, `name`, `type_` retain their values, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, and `moves` is the previous list with an additional element `f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}'**
