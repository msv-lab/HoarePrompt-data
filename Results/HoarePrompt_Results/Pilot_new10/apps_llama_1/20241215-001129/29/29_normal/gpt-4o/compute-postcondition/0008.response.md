Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `file` is the first file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of the first file, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of the first file. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` and `regulars` is an empty list. Otherwise, `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing `name`.***
