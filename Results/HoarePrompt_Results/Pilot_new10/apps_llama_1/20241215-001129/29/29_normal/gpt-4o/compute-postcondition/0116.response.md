The code appends a string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format 'move {regulars[i]} {target}', where `i` is 2 and `target` is `len(examples) + 3`. 

Since `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, the state of `regulars[2]` and `temp_counter` remains unchanged. 

The `moves` list now includes the string 'move {regulars[2]} {len(examples) + 3}'.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 3`, `regulars[2]` is not equal to `str(len(examples) + 3)`, `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[2]} {len(examples) + 3}'**
