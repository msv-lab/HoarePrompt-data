The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is unchanged, `files` is unchanged, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements and `regulars[2]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 3`, `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than the initial `temp_counter` plus one for which either `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[2]} {temp_counter - 1}'.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `files` is unchanged, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements and `regulars[2]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 3`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[2]} {temp_counter - 1}'**
