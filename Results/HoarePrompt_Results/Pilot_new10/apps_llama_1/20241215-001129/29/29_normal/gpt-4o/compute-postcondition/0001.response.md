The code creates an empty list `regulars`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (either "0" for a regular test or "1" for an example test), such that the filenames are distinct, `examples` is an empty list, and `regulars` is an empty list.
