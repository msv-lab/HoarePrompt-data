The code snippet `moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a string in the format 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}' to the `moves` list. Here, `i` is 0 and `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than the highest integer whose string representation is in `files_set` but not exceeding `2 * n`, or `2 * n + 1` if all such integers are in `files_set`. 

The values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `target`, and `temp_counter` remain unchanged as the given code snippet does not modify them. However, the value of `i` is not modified by this code snippet as well.

The `moves` list now has an additional element: `f'move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}'`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_` retain their values, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than the highest integer whose string representation is in `files_set` but not exceeding `2 * n`, or `2 * n + 1` if all such integers are in `files_set`, and `moves` is the previous list with an additional element `f'move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}'`.**
