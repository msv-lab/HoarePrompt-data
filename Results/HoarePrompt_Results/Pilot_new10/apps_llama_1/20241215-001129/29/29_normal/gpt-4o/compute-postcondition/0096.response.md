The provided Python code snippet updates the value of `regulars[i]`. 

`regulars[i]` is assigned the value of `str(temp_counter)`, which is a string representation of `temp_counter`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes an additional element `'move ' + str(temp_counter) + ' ' + str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes an additional element `'move ' + str(temp_counter) + ' ' + str(temp_counter)`**
