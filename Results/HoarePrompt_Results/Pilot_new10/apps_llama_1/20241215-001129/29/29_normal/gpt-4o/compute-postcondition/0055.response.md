The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, and `temp_counter` was initially equal to `i`, which is 2. Therefore, `temp_counter` becomes 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 3 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is 3, and `files_set` must contain "2".
