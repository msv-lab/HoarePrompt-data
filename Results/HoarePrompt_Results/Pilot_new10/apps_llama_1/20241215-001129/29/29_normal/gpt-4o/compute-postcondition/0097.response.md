The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` was not in `files_set`. After incrementing by 1, `temp_counter` becomes `temp_counter + 1`, which is now greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter + 1)` is not in `files_set` (but we cannot confirm this without knowing the original value of `temp_counter` and the contents of `files_set`), but `regulars[i]` is still `str(temp_counter)`, not `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and `moves` still includes an additional element `'move ' + str(temp_counter) + ' ' + str(temp_counter)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes an additional element `'move ' + str(temp_counter) + ' ' + str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes an additional element `'move ' + str(temp_counter) + ' ' + str(temp_counter)`**
