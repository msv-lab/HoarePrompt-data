The given code is `moves = []`. This line of code creates a new empty list called `moves`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type ("0" for regular test or "1" for example test).
- `examples` and `regulars` are lists of filenames of type "1" and type "0" respectively.
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed.

The new list `moves` is empty and does not affect the values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1", `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, and `moves` is an empty list.**
