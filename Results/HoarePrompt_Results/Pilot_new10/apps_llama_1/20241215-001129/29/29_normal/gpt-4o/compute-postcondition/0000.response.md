The code snippet `examples = []` initializes a new empty list `examples`. The initial state variables `n` and `files` are not modified by this code. 

The value of `n` is still a positive integer and `files` is still a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type, with distinct filenames and the number of files equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (either "0" for a regular test or "1" for an example test), such that the filenames are distinct, and `examples` is an empty list.**
