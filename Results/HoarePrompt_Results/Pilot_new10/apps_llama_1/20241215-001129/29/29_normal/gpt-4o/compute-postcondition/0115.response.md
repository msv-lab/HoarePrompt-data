Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements, initially `i` was 2, the current value of `i` is 2, `target` was initially `len(examples) + 3`, the current value of `target` is `len(examples) + 3`. If `regulars[2]` is not equal to `str(len(examples) + 3)`, then `regulars[2]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[2]} {temp_counter - 1}', otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the current value of `str(target)`, where `i` is 2, and `target` is `len(examples) + 3`.**
