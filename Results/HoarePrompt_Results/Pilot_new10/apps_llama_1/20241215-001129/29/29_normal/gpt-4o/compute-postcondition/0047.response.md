The value of `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, 
`n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, and `i` retain their initial values, 
`moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'` which now becomes `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'` since `examples[i]` has been updated to `str(temp_counter)`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, 
`n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, and `i` retain their initial values, 
`examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, 
`moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'`.
Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n`, `files`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, and `i` retain their initial values, `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `moves` list includes an additional element: `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'`.**
