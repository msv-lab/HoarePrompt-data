The code `regulars.append(name)` modifies the list `regulars` by adding the value of `name` to it. The initial state provides the following information: 
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of at least 2 tuples.
- `file` is the second file in the list.
- `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting.
- `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting.
- If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` and `regulars` is an empty list.
- Otherwise, `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing `name`.

Considering the conditional statement that determines the initial content of `examples` and `regulars`, the code's effect depends on the value of `type_`. 

However, regardless of the condition, the code `regulars.append(name)` will add `name` to the list `regulars`. 

Given that `regulars` could initially be either empty (if `type_` is '1') or contain `name` (if `type_` is not '1'), after executing `regulars.append(name)`, 
- If `type_` is '1', `regulars` will now contain `name`.
- If `type_` is not '1', `regulars` will now contain a duplicate of `name`, since `name` was already in `regulars`.

Therefore, the updated state after executing the code is:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of at least 2 tuples.
- `file` is the second file in the list.
- `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting.
- `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting.
- If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` and `regulars` is a list containing `name`.
- Otherwise, `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing at least two `name`s (or more precisely, `name` appears at least twice in `regulars`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` and `regulars` is a list containing `name`, otherwise, `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing at least two `name`s**
