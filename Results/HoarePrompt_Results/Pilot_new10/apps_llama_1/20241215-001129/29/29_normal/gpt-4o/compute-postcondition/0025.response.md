The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is `n + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representation of `n + 1`.**
