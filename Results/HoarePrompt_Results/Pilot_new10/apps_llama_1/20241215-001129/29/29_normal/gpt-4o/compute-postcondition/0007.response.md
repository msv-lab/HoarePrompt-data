The code appends `name` to the `regulars` list. The previous value of `regulars` was an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is a list containing `name`, `file` is the first file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of the first file, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of the first file, and `type_` is not equal to '1'**
