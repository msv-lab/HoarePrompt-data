The function accepts an input string of three space-separated real numbers from the standard input, calculates twelve different exponentiation expressions, and prints the string representation of the expression that results in the maximum value, assuming the input is well-formed and within a specified range, without explicit handling for potential edge cases such as invalid input formats or out-of-range values.
