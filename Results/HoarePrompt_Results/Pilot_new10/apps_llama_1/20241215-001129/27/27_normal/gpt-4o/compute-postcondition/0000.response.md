The input is redirected to read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. This line of code does not change the values of `x`, `y`, or `z` directly, but it changes how the input will be read in the subsequent code.

Output State: **The input is a string containing three space-separated real numbers x, y, and z, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point, such that 0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0, and input is now read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.**
