You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:  a_1 = x^{y}^{z};  a_2 = x^{z}^{y};  a_3 = (x^{y})^{z};  a_4 = (x^{z})^{y};  a_5 = y^{x}^{z};  a_6 = y^{z}^{x};  a_7 = (y^{x})^{z};  a_8 = (y^{z})^{x};  a_9 = z^{x}^{y};  a_10 = z^{y}^{x};  a_11 = (z^{x})^{y};  a_12 = (z^{y})^{x}. 

Let m be the maximum of all the a_{i}, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that a_{c} = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that a_{c}.

 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.


-----Output-----

Find the maximum value of expression among x^{y}^{z}, x^{z}^{y}, (x^{y})^{z}, (x^{z})^{y}, y^{x}^{z}, y^{z}^{x}, (y^{x})^{z}, (y^{z})^{x}, z^{x}^{y}, z^{y}^{x}, (z^{x})^{y}, (z^{y})^{x} and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

x^{y}^{z} should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (x^{y})^{z} should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(float, input().split())
    a1 = x ** y ** z
    a2 = x ** z ** y
    a3 = (x ** y) ** z
    a4 = (x ** z) ** y
    a5 = y ** x ** z
    a6 = y ** z ** x
    a7 = (y ** x) ** z
    a8 = (y ** z) ** x
    a9 = z ** x ** y
    a10 = z ** y ** x
    a11 = (z ** x) ** y
    a12 = (z ** y) ** x
    a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12]
    b = ['x^y^z', 'x^z^y', '(x^y)^z', '(x^z)^y', 'y^x^z', 'y^z^x', '(y^x)^z', '(y^z)^x', 'z^x^y', 'z^y^x', '(z^x)^y', '(z^y)^x']
    print(b[a.index(max(a))])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program given correctly follows the problem description and calculates the maximum value among the 12 given expressions, then prints the corresponding expression.

The code defines the 12 expressions as `a1` through `a12`, stores them in a list `a`, and their corresponding string representations in a list `b`. It then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum value in the list `a`, finds the index of this maximum value using `a.index(max(a))`, and prints the string representation of this expression from list `b`.

Since the problem description requires finding the maximum value among these expressions and printing the corresponding string representation, and the code correctly implements this, I could not find a case where the program does not work as expected. The code handles all potential cases by calculating and comparing all 12 expressions, and it handles cases of multiple maximums by printing the one that comes first in the list.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and will work as expected for all inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of three space-separated real numbers x, y, and z, where 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and each of x, y, and z has exactly one digit after the decimal point.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(float, input().split())
    a1 = x ** y ** z
    a2 = x ** z ** y
    a3 = (x ** y) ** z
    a4 = (x ** z) ** y
    a5 = y ** x ** z
    a6 = y ** z ** x
    a7 = (y ** x) ** z
    a8 = (y ** z) ** x
    a9 = z ** x ** y
    a10 = z ** y ** x
    a11 = (z ** x) ** y
    a12 = (z ** y) ** x
    a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12]
    b = ['x^y^z', 'x^z^y', '(x^y)^z', '(x^z)^y', 'y^x^z', 'y^z^x', '(y^x)^z',
    '(y^z)^x', 'z^x^y', 'z^y^x', '(z^x)^y', '(z^y)^x']
    print(b[a.index(max(a))])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three space-separated real numbers as input, calculates 12 different exponentiation expressions, and prints the human-readable representation of the expression with the maximum value, without handling potential input exceptions or validation errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
