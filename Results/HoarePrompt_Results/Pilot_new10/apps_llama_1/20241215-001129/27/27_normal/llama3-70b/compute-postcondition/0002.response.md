The code `a2 = x ** z ** y` assigns the value of `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y` to `a2`. Since the initial state already defines `a1` as `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`, which is equivalent to `x ** (y ** z)`, we now have `a2` as `x ** (z ** y)`. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `a1` are not affected by this assignment. 

Given that `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, the values of `a1` and `a2` will be real numbers but their exact values depend on the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. `a1` equals `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z` (`x ** (y ** z)`), and `a2` equals `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y` (`x ** (z ** y)`).

Output State: **`x` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `a1` is `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`, `a2` is `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`.**
