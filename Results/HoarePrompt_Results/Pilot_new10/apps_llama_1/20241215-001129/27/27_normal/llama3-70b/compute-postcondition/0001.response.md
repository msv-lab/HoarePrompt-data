To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `x` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point.

The code is: `a1 = x ** y ** z`. 

This line of code calculates the value of `a1` as `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`. 

Given the ranges of `x`, `y`, and `z`, and considering the properties of exponentiation, `a1` will be a real number. The exact value of `a1` depends on the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `z` but will generally be quite large due to the nature of exponential growth, especially when all values are greater than 1. However, since `x`, `y`, and `z` can also be between 0.1 and 1, `a1` could also be less than 1 if `y` and `z` are small enough to reduce the overall exponent below 1.

Therefore, considering all possibilities, `a1` could be a very large number or a fraction, depending on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The states of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not changed by the code, as it only introduces a new variable `a1` based on their values.

Output State: **`x` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `a1` is a real number equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`.**
