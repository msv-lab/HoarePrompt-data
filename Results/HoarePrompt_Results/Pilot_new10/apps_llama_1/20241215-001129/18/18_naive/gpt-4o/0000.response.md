Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly calculate the number of spectators standing at time t. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- If t is less than or equal to k, the number of standing spectators is equal to t. This is because the spectators stand one by one from the first to the k-th spectator.

- If t is greater than k but less than or equal to n, the number of standing spectators remains constant at k. This is because the first spectator starts sitting down at time k+1, and the last spectator stands up at time n.

- If t is greater than n, the number of standing spectators decreases as time increases. The number of standing spectators at time t is equal to n + k - t. This is because the spectators start sitting down one by one from the first to the last spectator, and the number of standing spectators decreases by 1 at each time step.

The program correctly handles all these cases, and it does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle. 

For example, for the input (10, 5, 3), the program correctly prints 3. For the input (10, 5, 7), the program correctly prints 5. For the input (10, 5, 12), the program correctly prints 3. 

Since the program seems to work correctly for all the examples and it does not contain any obvious errors, it is likely that the program is correct. However, it's always possible that there might be some edge case that is not immediately apparent. But based on the given information and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.
