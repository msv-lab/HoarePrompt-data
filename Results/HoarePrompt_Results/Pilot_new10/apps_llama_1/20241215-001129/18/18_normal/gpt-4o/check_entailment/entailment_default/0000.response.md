Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It handles three cases based on the value of `t` relative to `n` and `k`. 

If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is `t`, which is correctly printed by the function.

If `t` is larger than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains at `k`, which is also correctly printed by the function.

If `t` is larger than `n`, the number of standing spectators starts to decrease. The function prints `n + k - t`, which correctly represents the number of standing spectators in this case.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the logic used to determine the number of standing spectators. The examples provided also match the expected output of the function, which further confirms its correctness.

After thoroughly examining the code, output hints, and examples, I could not find any case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
