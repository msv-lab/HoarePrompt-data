The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t` with specific constraints, and prints a value based on the relative values of `n`, `k`, and `t`: `t` if `t` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` if `t` is larger than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, and `n + k - t` if `t` is larger than `n`.
