Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `t` is an integer between 1 and `n + k - 1`, and `t` is larger than `k`. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the value of `k` has been printed. If `t` is larger than `n`, the value of `n + k - t` is a negative integer.**
