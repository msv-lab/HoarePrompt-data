You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly calculate the number of spectators standing at time t. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- If t is less than or equal to k, the number of standing spectators is equal to t. This is because the spectators stand one by one from the first to the k-th spectator.

- If t is greater than k but less than or equal to n, the number of standing spectators remains constant at k. This is because the first spectator starts sitting down at time k+1, and the last spectator stands up at time n.

- If t is greater than n, the number of standing spectators decreases as time increases. The number of standing spectators at time t is equal to n + k - t. This is because the spectators start sitting down one by one from the first to the last spectator, and the number of standing spectators decreases by 1 at each time step.

The program correctly handles all these cases, and it does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle. 

For example, for the input (10, 5, 3), the program correctly prints 3. For the input (10, 5, 7), the program correctly prints 5. For the input (10, 5, 12), the program correctly prints 3. 

Since the program seems to work correctly for all the examples and it does not contain any obvious errors, it is likely that the program is correct. However, it's always possible that there might be some edge case that is not immediately apparent. But based on the given information and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and t are integers, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if (t <= k) :
        print(t)
    else :
        if (t <= n) :
            print(k)
        else :
            print(n + k - t)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `t` is an integer between 1 and `n + k - 1`, and `t` is larger than `k`. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the value of `k` has been printed. If `t` is larger than `n`, the value of `n + k - t` is a negative integer.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `t` is an integer between 1 and `n + k - 1`. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `t` has been printed. If `t` is larger than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the value of `k` has been printed. If `t` is larger than `n`, the value of `n + k - t` is a negative integer, but since `n`, `k`, and `t` are returned as integers at the output state, `n + k - t` being negative indicates `t` is indeed larger than `n` as per the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t` with specific constraints, and prints a value based on the relative values of `n`, `k`, and `t`: `t` if `t` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` if `t` is larger than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, and `n + k - t` if `t` is larger than `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
