The function seems to be missing parameters in its definition. Based on the provided constraints, it should accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`. 

The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`. `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`. 

However, the output description is missing. To provide a complete answer, the output description is necessary. 

If we were to assume the output description would follow a similar pattern to the examples, it might look something like this:

Output: 
Case_1: If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the function returns a value based on `t` and `n`;
Case_2: If `t` is greater than `n` but less than `n + k`, the function returns a value based on `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Given the provided information, the most accurate description would be:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and t, where n, k, and t are integers with specific constraints, and returns a value based on the values of n, k, and t.**
