Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the logic to determine the number of spectators standing at time `t` according to the given problem description. The function takes into account two main scenarios: when `t` is less than or equal to `n` and when `t` is greater than `n`.

In the case where `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is simply the minimum of `t` and `k`. This is because the first `t` spectators stand, up to a maximum of `k`.

When `t` is greater than `n`, the number of standing spectators is calculated as `k - (t - n) % k`. This formula accounts for the fact that after `n` spectators have stood, the first spectator sits at `t = n+1`, the second at `t = n+2`, and so on. The modulo operation `(t - n) % k` determines how many spectators have sat down at time `t`, and subtracting this from `k` gives the number of spectators still standing.

The code accurately handles the edge cases and follows the problem description. The output hints also align with the code's logic, providing further confidence in its correctness. The examples provided in the problem description, such as inputting `10 5 3`, `10 5 7`, and `10 5 12`, also yield the expected outputs of `3`, `5`, and `3`, respectively, when using the provided code. Therefore, the code accurately implements the problem description for every potential case.
