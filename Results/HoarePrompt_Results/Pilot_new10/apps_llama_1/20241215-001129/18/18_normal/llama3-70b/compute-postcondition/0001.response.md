To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given code and the initial state of the variables.

The code is: `print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)`

Given the initial state: `n`, `k`, and `t` are input integers.

Let's break it down:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the code prints the minimum of `t` and `k`. This means the printed value will be the smaller of the two values `t` and `k`.

2. If `t` is greater than `n`, the code prints `k - (t - n) % k`. Here, `(t - n) % k` calculates the remainder of `(t - n)` divided by `k`, and then `k` minus this remainder is printed.

Considering these two cases, we can determine the output based on the relationship between `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `t` is the third input integer, and the printed value is `min(t, k)` if `t <= n`, otherwise it is `k - (t - n) % k`**
