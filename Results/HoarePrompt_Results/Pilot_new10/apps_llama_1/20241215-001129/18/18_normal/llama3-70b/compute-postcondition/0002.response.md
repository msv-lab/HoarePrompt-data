The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters n, k, and t, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function `func` should accept three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `t`, where `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, 1 <= `k` <= `n`, and 1 <= `t` < `n` + `k`. However, the problem description and output for the function are missing, so we cannot determine the return value.


To provide a complete answer, we need to know the output of the function. However, based on the information given, we can describe the parameters.


Functionality: **The function should accept parameters n, k, and t, where n, k, and t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= t < n + k, and return a value based on the given output conditions which are currently unknown.**
