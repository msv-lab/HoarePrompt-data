Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the rules of the Mexican wave as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is simply `t`, because each time step adds one more spectator standing.
- If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains at `k`, because each time step adds one more spectator standing and one more spectator sitting.
- If `t` is greater than `n`, the number of standing spectators decreases by one each time step, starting from `k`. This is because the spectators who stood first start sitting down. The number of standing spectators at time `t` is `n + k - t`.

The program handles all these cases correctly and doesn't have any obvious edge cases that it doesn't account for. It also passes the provided example test cases. Therefore, it is a correct implementation of the Mexican wave problem.
