Correctness: **True**

The given code is a simple and correct implementation of the problem description. It iterates through the string `s` and increments the counter `ans` whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. This effectively counts the number of segments of continuous characters in the string, which is the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Strings with all characters being the same (in which case the output is 1)
* Strings with alternating characters (in which case the output is equal to the length of the string)
* Strings with sequences of the same character (in which case the output is equal to the number of transitions to different characters)

The output hints provided agree with the code's behavior, and the examples given in the problem description (e.g., `abaca` and `abcddcba`) are also correctly handled by the code.

The code's logic is straightforward and easy to follow, and it does not appear to have any missing edge cases or incorrect assumptions. Therefore, it is correct to conclude that the code does what the problem description says for every potential case.
