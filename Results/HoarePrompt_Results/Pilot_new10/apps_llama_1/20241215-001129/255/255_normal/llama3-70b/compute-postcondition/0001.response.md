The value of `s` is updated to be the input string. The input string `s` can be any string, but based on the given constraints for `n` and the initial `s`, we know `n` is still the length of the string `s`. The length of `s` is still within the range of 1 to 500 characters, and it consists only of lowercase Latin letters is not guaranteed as the input can have any characters.

However, since the input is assigned to `s`, we can say that `s` is the input string, and its length `n` can be any value between 1 and 500 if the input string length falls within that range.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 500`, `s` is the input string of length `n`.**
