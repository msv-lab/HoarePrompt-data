You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string s. 

Here's the explanation for the correctness of the program:

* The program starts with a single operation to delete the first character. This is because we need at least one operation to delete the string.
* Then it iterates over the string from the second character to the end. For each character, it checks if the current character is different from the previous one.
* If the characters are different, it increments the operation count. This is because if the characters are different, we need a new operation to delete the contiguous substring of the current character.
* Finally, it prints the total operation count.

This approach works correctly because the problem statement allows us to delete any contiguous substring of the same character in one operation. So, we only need to count the number of distinct characters in the string, and each distinct character will require a new operation.

We can test this program with several examples to verify its correctness:

* For the input "abaca", the program outputs "3", which is correct because we need three operations to delete the string: one for "a", one for "b" and "a", and one for "c" and "a".
* For the input "abcddcba", the program outputs "4", which is correct because we need four operations to delete the string: one for "a", one for "b" and "c", one for "d", and one for "c" and "b" and "a".

We can try different inputs, and the program will always output the correct minimum number of operations to delete the whole string. Therefore, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n, where 1 <= n <= 500, and a string s of length n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 500`, `s` is the input string of length `n`, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is the number of segments of continuous characters in `s`, which is at least `1` and increases by `1` for each transition to a different character in `s`.
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
