The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. The initial state includes `n` as an integer where `1 <= n <= 500` and `s` as the input string of length `n`. These conditions are not affected by the assignment of `ans`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 500`, `s` is the input string of length `n`, and `ans` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 500`, `s` is the input string of length `n`, and `ans` is `1`.**
