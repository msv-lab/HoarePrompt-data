Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the operation described in the problem description. 

The key insight here is that the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string is equivalent to the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the string plus one. 

This is because each operation can delete a contiguous substring of equal characters, and each transition between different characters represents the start of a new substring that needs to be deleted. 

The program correctly counts the number of transitions between different consecutive characters by iterating through the string and incrementing the `operations` counter whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. 

The initial value of `operations` is set to 1, which correctly accounts for the case where the entire string consists of the same character, in which case only one operation is needed to delete it.

The program does not need to explicitly check if `n` is within the range of 1 to 500 or if `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, as this is assumed to be the case according to the problem description. 

Overall, the program correctly implements the operation described in the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
