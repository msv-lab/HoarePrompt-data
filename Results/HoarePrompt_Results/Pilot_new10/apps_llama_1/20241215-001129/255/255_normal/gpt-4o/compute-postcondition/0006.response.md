Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1`, then `operations` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `operations` and other variables remains as in the precondition since there is no else part to modify them.***
