To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because if `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not iterate.

At the start of the loop, `i` will be 1, as that's the starting point of the range. The states of `s` (the input string) and `operations` (which is 1) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, as the loop's iteration depends solely on `n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the necessary adjustments to the state are:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` starts at 1.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` must be greater than 1, `operations` is 1, `i` is 1**
