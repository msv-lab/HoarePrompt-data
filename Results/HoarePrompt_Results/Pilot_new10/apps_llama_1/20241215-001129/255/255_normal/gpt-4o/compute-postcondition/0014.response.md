The `print(operations)` statement prints the current value of `operations` to the console. The value of `operations` is 1 plus the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the first `n-1` characters of `s`. This print statement does not change the values of any variables.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the input integer, if `n` is greater than 1 then `i` is `n-1` and `operations` is 1 plus the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, otherwise `i` is undefined in the context of the loop's execution but is determined by the loop's range which would not have executed and `operations` is 1, and the value of `operations` has been printed**
