You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)


```
Output hints: The function takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input from the user, calculates the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the string `s`, and prints this count. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints 1. The function does not check if `n` is within the range of 1 to 500 or if `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
