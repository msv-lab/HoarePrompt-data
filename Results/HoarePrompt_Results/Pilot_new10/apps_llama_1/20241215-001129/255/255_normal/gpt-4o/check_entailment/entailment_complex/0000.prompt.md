You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the input string, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, and `operations` is 1 plus the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the first `n-1` characters of `s`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and `operations` remains 1, `i` is undefined in the context of the loop's execution but is determined by the loop's range which would not have executed, and `s` remains the input string.
    print(operations)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input from the user, calculates the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the string `s`, and prints this count. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints 1. The function does not check if `n` is within the range of 1 to 500 or if `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
