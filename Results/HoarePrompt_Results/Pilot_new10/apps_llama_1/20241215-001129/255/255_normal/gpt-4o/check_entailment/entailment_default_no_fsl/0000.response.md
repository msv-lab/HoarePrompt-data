Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$. The program iterates through the string, incrementing the operations count whenever it encounters a character different from the previous one. This approach is correct because, in the context of the problem, each sequence of the same characters can be deleted in one operation.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description and examples provided. For instance, in the example "abaca", the transitions occur at positions where 'a' meets 'b', 'b' meets 'a', and 'a' meets 'c', resulting in 3 operations (one for each transition plus the initial operation to account for the first character). This matches the expected output.

The provided output hints also suggest that the function works as expected, counting the transitions between different consecutive characters and printing this count. Although the hints mention that the function does not check for the range of $n$ or the composition of $s$, this does not affect the correctness of the operation count itself, given that the input adheres to the problem description.

However, it is worth noting that the program does not include error checking for the input parameters $n$ and $s$ as specified in the problem description (e.g., $n$ being within the range of 1 to 500 and $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters of length $n$). Despite this, the program's logic for calculating the minimum number of operations based on the string $s$ is sound. 

Given the constraints and examples provided, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, thus justifying the conclusion of Correctness: **True**.
