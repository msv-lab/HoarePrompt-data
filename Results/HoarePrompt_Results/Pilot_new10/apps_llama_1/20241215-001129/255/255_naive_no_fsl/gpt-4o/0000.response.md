Correctness: **True**

The given program works correctly because it correctly counts the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string $s$. 

The program iterates through the string, and whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one, it increments the operation count. This is because the previous contiguous substring of equal characters can be deleted in one operation, and the new character marks the start of another contiguous substring.

This approach works correctly because the problem allows the deletion of any contiguous substring of equal characters. The program does not need to consider the actual length of the contiguous substrings, only the transitions between different characters.

For example, in the string "abaca", the program correctly counts 3 operations: one for "a", one for "b", and one for "aca" which can be deleted in one operation because although "a" and "c" are different, "aa" was not together so the program has counted "a" before.

All the provided examples have been correctly solved by the program, and no edge cases have been found that would cause the program to produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is correct.
