Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is designed to compare two numbers, X and Y, represented in different bases. The program first converts the given digits of X and Y into their decimal equivalents using the function `func_1`, and then compares these decimal values to determine the relationship between X and Y.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of a number represented in a given base. It iterates through the digits from left to right, updating the decimal value by multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the current digit.

The main part of the program reads the input for X and Y, converts them to decimal using `func_1`, and then compares these decimal values to print '<', '>', or '=' accordingly.

All the logic in the program aligns with the problem description, and there's no apparent case where it would not work as expected. The provided examples also demonstrate the program's correctness in various scenarios.

The key to the program's correctness is the accurate conversion of numbers from their respective bases to decimal, which allows for a straightforward comparison. Since the conversion and comparison are correctly implemented, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
