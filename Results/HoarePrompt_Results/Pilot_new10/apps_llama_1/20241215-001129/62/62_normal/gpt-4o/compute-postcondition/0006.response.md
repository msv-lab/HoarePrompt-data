The given code multiplies the current `decimal_value` by `base` and then adds the `digit`. The initial state provides that `decimal_value` is equal to the new `digit` times `(base + 1)`, and `digit` is the third digit in `digits`. 

Given `decimal_value = digit * (base + 1)`, 
the new `decimal_value` after execution will be:
`decimal_value = (digit * (base + 1)) * base + digit`.

This simplifies to:
`decimal_value = digit * (base^2 + base) + digit`.

Further simplification yields:
`decimal_value = digit * (base^2 + base + 1)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list with at least three non-negative integers, each less than `base`, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), `decimal_value` is equal to the third digit in `digits` times `(base^2 + base + 1)`, and `digit` is the third digit in `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list with at least three non-negative integers, each less than `base`, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), `decimal_value` is equal to `digit` times `(base^2 + base + 1)`, and `digit` is the third digit in `digits`**
