The original assessment states that the given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic for comparing two numbers represented in different bases. The output hints provided summarize the code functionality and do not indicate any incorrect behavior.

Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic for converting numbers from different bases to decimal and comparing them. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of the input number represented in a given base.

The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` calculates the decimal equivalent of the input number without any error checking or handling, which is consistent with the problem description's assumption that the input will be valid.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.

Final: **True**
