Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. It first reads the number of digits and the base of each number, then reads the digits of each number. The `func_1` function is used to convert the digits from their respective bases to decimal. The program then compares the decimal values and prints the result.

The program handles all the potential cases correctly. It does not perform any error checking or handling, but this is not required according to the problem description, which guarantees that the input will be valid (i.e., no leading zeroes, all digits are non-negative integers less than their respective bases, and the bases are between 2 and 40).

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the program for different inputs. For instance, in the first example, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 and Y = 47_10, so the program correctly outputs '='. In the second example, X = 102_3 = 11_10 and Y = 24_5 = 14_10, so the program correctly outputs '<'.

In general, the program will work correctly for any valid input, because it accurately converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal and then compares the decimal values. Therefore, the program's correctness is verified.
