To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `digits` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, each less than `base`.
- `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive).
- `decimal_value` is equal to the first digit in `digits`.
- `digit` is the first digit in `digits`.

The loop statement is `for digit in digits:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the `digits` list.

For the loop to execute again, it must not have reached the end of the `digits` list yet. Since `digit` is the first digit in `digits` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `digits` must have at least two elements (since it's already processed the first one).
- `base` remains unchanged as it's not modified by the loop iteration itself.
- `decimal_value` must be updated to be equal to the next (second) digit in `digits`, assuming the loop body modifies it based on the current digit being processed.
- `digit` must be the next (second) digit in `digits` for the loop to process it in the next iteration.

State: **`digits` is a list with at least two non-negative integers, each less than `base`, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), `decimal_value` is equal to the second digit in `digits`, and `digit` is the second digit in `digits`**
