The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, and `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), where each digit in `digits` is less than `base`. The function returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by the list `digits` in base `base`.
