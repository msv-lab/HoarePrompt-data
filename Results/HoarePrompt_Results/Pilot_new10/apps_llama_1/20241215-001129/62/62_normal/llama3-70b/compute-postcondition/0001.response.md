According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, and `result` is 0. For the loop to execute, `digits` must have at least 1 digit.

State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40 and for all i in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, and `result` is 0**
