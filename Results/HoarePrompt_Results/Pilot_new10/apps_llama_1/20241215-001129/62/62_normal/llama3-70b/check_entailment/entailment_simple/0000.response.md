Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input in the specified format, which includes the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y. It uses `map(int, input().split())` to read and parse the input into integers.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` converts the given base `base` number represented by the list of digits `digits` into its decimal equivalent. It does this by iterating through each digit from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the current digit. This is a standard algorithm for converting numbers from any base to decimal.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers X and Y to their decimal equivalents using `func_1`, the program compares these decimal values. Based on the comparison, it outputs '<' if X is less than Y, '>' if X is greater than Y, and '=' if X is equal to Y. This directly follows the problem description's requirements for comparing the two numbers.

The program handles all potential cases as follows:

- It correctly converts numbers from bases between 2 and 40 to decimal, as required.
- It handles numbers of varying lengths (up to 10 digits), as specified.
- It ensures that the digits for each number are within the valid range for their respective bases (0 â‰¤ digit < base).
- It correctly compares the decimal equivalents of the two numbers and outputs the result as specified.

Given that the program adheres to the problem description's requirements and handles all specified cases correctly, it is considered correct.
