According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one more digit, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, `result` equals `result * base + digit`, and `digit` is one of the values in `digits`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `digits` must have at least one more digit, and `digit` should be the next digit in the list.

State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, `result` equals `result * base + digit`, and `digit` is the next value in `digits`**
