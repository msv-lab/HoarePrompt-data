The code `result = result * base + digit` updates the value of `result`. Initially, `result` equals one of the `digits` values (a non-negative integer less than `base`), and `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40. After the update, `result` becomes `result * base + digit`. 

Given that `digit` is one of the values in `digits` and for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, the new value of `result` is a combination of its old value multiplied by `base` and added to `digit`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `digits` remains a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 digits, `base` remains an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, and for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`. 

Also, note that `digit` is not defined in the initial state, so we consider it as a new variable that has been introduced.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, `result` equals `result * base + digit`, and `digit` is one of the values in `digits`.**
