According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 2 digits, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, and `result` equals one of the `digits` values. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 digits.
State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, and `result` equals one of the `digits` values (a non-negative integer less than `base`)**
