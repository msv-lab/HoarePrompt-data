Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only handles the case where `n` is 2, and for other values of `n`, it incorrectly outputs a sequence of fractions.

The program prints `1/(n//2) + 1/n` for all `n` greater than 2. However, this does not satisfy the given equation `1/n + 1/(n-1) = 1 - 1/n` for all `n`. 

For example, when `n = 4`, the equation becomes `1/4 + 1/3 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4`, but the program outputs `1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4`, which is correct. However, the problem statement requires the denominators to be less than `n`, which `n` itself does not satisfy.

A counterexample can be seen when `n = 5`. The equation becomes `1/5 + 1/4 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. However, the program outputs `1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10`, which is not equal to `4/5`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect. It does not handle all cases correctly and does not produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
