Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. It simply generates all the divisors of `n` and pairs them with `1` as the numerator, which is not guaranteed to satisfy the equation.

For example, when the input is `6`, the program correctly outputs `YES` and generates the sequence `1/2` and `1/3`, which sums up to `1 - 1/6`. However, when the input is `4`, the program outputs `YES` and generates the sequence `1/2`, which does not sum up to `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`. The correct output for the input `4` should be `YES` and the sequence `1/2` and `1/4`, but the program does not generate this sequence.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where `n` is a prime number greater than `2`. In this case, the only divisors of `n` are `1` and `n`, and the program should output `NO` because there is no sequence of fractions that sums up to `1 - 1/n`. However, the program outputs `YES` and generates an empty sequence.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. This can be done by using a different approach, such as using the fact that `1 - 1/n = (n-1)/n` and finding a sequence of fractions that sums up to `(n-1)/n`.
