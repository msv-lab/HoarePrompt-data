Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the goal is to find a sequence of fractions that sums up to 1 - 1/n, where each fraction has a divisor of n as the denominator. However, the given program simply generates a sequence of fractions with all divisors of n as denominators, which does not necessarily satisfy the sum condition.

A counterexample can be found with the input n = 6. The program will output:
```
YES
3
1 2
1 3
1 6
```
However, the sum of these fractions is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 6/6 = 1, which is not equal to 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The correct output for n = 6 is:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 3
```
which sums up to 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6, as required.

The program fails to generate the correct sequence of fractions for this input because it simply generates fractions with all divisors of n as denominators, without considering the sum condition. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to generate a sequence of fractions that satisfies the sum condition, which may require a more complex algorithm.
