The value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to the `divisors` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `n` is a multiple of `i` (i.e., `n` is divisible by 2) and `i` is 2, `n` is an even integer. The range of `n` is still between 4 and 10^9 (inclusive), but now we also know that `n` is divisible by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing the integer 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing the integer 2, `i` is 2**
