Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet all the requirements specified in the problem description. The main issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for divisors of the input number `n` up to its square root and then constructs fractions with these divisors. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions will be equal to `1 - 1/n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 6`. The program will correctly output `YES` and then list the fractions `1/2` and `1/3`, which indeed sum up to `1 - 1/6`. However, for `n = 4`, the program will incorrectly output `YES` and then list the fraction `1/2` only, but `1/2` does not equal `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`.

Another case where the program fails is when `n` is a prime number greater than 2. In such cases, the only divisors are `1` and `n` itself, but since the problem statement specifies that `1 < b_i < n`, the program will incorrectly output `NO` without even attempting to find a sequence of fractions.

The program's logic is flawed, and it does not handle all possible cases correctly. It only works for specific inputs like `n = 6` but fails for many others. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
