The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on three possible cases: 
In Case_1, the function returns 'NO'. 
In Case_2, the function returns 'NO'. 
In Case_3, the function returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and then lists each of these divisors in the format '1 d', where d is a divisor of `n` and is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. 
Since only one case can be fulfilled at a time, the function will return either 'NO' or a 'YES' string with the specified divisor information. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by the count and list of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by the count and list of divisors of n that are less than or equal to the square root of n.**
