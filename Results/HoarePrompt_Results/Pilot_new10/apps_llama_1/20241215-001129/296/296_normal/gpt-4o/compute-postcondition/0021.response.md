To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        divisors.append(i)
        if i!= n // i:
            divisors.append(n // i)
```
From the loop code, we can see that the loop will iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it appends `i` to the `divisors` list and also appends `n // i` if `i` is not equal to `n // i`.

Now, let's analyze the output states after the first few iterations:

* After 1 iteration: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 2. If `n` is even, then `divisors` is a list containing the integers 2 and `n // 2` if `n // i` is not equal to `i`.
* After 2 iterations: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 3. If `n` is a multiple of 3 and `n` is greater than 9, then `divisors` is a list containing the integers 3 and `n // 3`, given that `i` is not equal to `n // i`.
* After 3 iterations: `n` is an integer such that 16 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 4. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then if `i` is not equal to `n // i`, `divisors` is a list containing the values 4 and `n // 4`.

From these output states, we can see that the loop is finding the divisors of `n` and appending them to the `divisors` list. The loop will execute at least once if `n` has a divisor between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive).

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to the square root of `n` (if `n` is a perfect square) or the largest integer less than the square root of `n`. The `divisors` list will contain all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`. If `n` is a perfect square, its square root will be appended to the `divisors` list only once.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`.**
