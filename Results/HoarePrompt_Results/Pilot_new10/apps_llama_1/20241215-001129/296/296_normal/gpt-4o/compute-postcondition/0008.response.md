To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet: `divisors.append(n // i)`. 

Given that `n` is an even integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing the integer 2, and `i` is 2.

Since `i` is 2, `n // i` will be `n // 2`. Given that `n` is even, `n // 2` will always be an integer.

The code appends `n // i` (which is `n // 2`) to the list `divisors`. So, after the execution, `divisors` will contain two elements: 2 and `n // 2`.

The states of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing the integers 2 and `n // 2`, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing the integers 2 and `n // 2`, `i` is 2**
