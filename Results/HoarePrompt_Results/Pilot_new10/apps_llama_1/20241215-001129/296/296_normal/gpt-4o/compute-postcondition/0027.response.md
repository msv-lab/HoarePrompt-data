To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given return statement and the initial state of variables.

Given the return statement:
```python
return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
```
And the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9.
- `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
- `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` and is not empty.
- `k` is the number of elements in `divisors`.
- `fractions` is a list of tuples equal to [(1, d) for d in `divisors`].

Let's break down what the return statement will output:
1. `'YES\n{k}\n'`: This part of the string will output "YES" followed by a newline, then the number of elements in `divisors` (which is `k`), followed by another newline.
2. `'\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)`: This part will take each tuple in `fractions`, format it into a string with a space between the two elements of the tuple, and then join all these strings together with newlines in between. Since `fractions` is defined as [(1, d) for d in `divisors`], each line will be "1" followed by a divisor of `n` that is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

So, putting it all together:
- The string starts with "YES" to indicate the presence of divisors.
- Then, it outputs the count of divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
- Finally, it lists each of these divisors in the format "1 d", where d is a divisor.

Output State: **The program returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and then lists each of these divisors in the format '1 d', where d is a divisor of `n` and is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.**
