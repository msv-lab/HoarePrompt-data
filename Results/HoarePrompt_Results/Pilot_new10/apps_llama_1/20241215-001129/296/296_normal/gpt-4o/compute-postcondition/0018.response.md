To calculate the result, let's first understand the impact of the code on the program. The code `divisors.append(n // i)` adds a new element to the `divisors` list. This new element is the result of the integer division of `n` by `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 16 <= `n` <= 10^9
- `i` is 4
- `divisors` is a list containing the value 4

The new element added to the `divisors` list is `n // i`, which is equivalent to `n // 4` since `i` is 4. 

The value of `n // 4` depends on `n`, but since `n` is within the range 16 <= `n` <= 10^9, `n // 4` will be within the range 4 <= `n // 4` <= 2.5 * 10^8.

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is:
- `n` is still an integer such that 16 <= `n` <= 10^9
- `i` is still 4
- `divisors` is a list containing the values 4 and `n // 4`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 16 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 4, `divisors` is a list containing the values 4 and `n // 4`**
