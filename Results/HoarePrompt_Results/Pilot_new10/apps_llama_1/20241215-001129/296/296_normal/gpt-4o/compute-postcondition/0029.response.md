The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` between 2 and 10^9. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, in which case it returns 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 2, it calculates the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` and stores them in the `divisors` list. If the `divisors` list is empty (i.e., `n` is a prime number), the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and then lists each of these divisors in the format '1 d', where d is a divisor of `n` and is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that the code does not handle the case when `n` is a perfect square (i.e., its square root is an integer). In this case, the square root of `n` will be counted twice as a divisor, once as `i` and once as `n // i`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a positive integer `n` between 2 and 10^9 and return either 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or if `n` is a prime number, or a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and then lists each of these divisors in the format '1 d', where d is a divisor of `n` and is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. However, the function may include duplicate divisors if `n` is a perfect square.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer n between 2 and 10^9 and returns either 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 2 or if n is a prime number, or a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors of n that are less than or equal to the square root of n, and then lists each of these divisors in the format '1 d', where d is a divisor of n and is less than or equal to the square root of n, but may include duplicate divisors if n is a perfect square. **
