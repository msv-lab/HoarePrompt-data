Given the initial state that `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to 2, this implies `n` can only be 2 because it's the only positive integer that satisfies both conditions (being less than or equal to 2 and greater than or equal to 2). However, the code simply returns the string 'NO' without any direct relation to the value of `n`. 

Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**
