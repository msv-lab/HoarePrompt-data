The value of `n` is divided by `i` and the result is appended to the `divisors` list. The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 9 and less than or equal to 10^9, and `i` is 3. 

So, `n // i` is `n // 3`, which means the integer part of the division of `n` by 3. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `n // 3` will be greater than or equal to 3.

The `divisors` list initially contains the integer 3. After executing the code, it will contain 3 and `n // 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 9 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 3, `divisors` is a list containing the integers 3 and `n // 3`.**
