To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides that:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9.
- `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
- `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `divisors` is not empty.

The code `k = len(divisors)` assigns the length of the `divisors` list to the variable `k`. This means `k` will hold the count of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

Given that `divisors` is not empty, `k` will be at least 1, because there is at least one divisor (1 itself is a divisor of every number, and since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the list must contain at least the divisor 1, and depending on `n`, possibly more divisors up to the square root of `n`).

The states of `n`, `i`, and `divisors` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` remains the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `divisors` remains a list of all divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

The output state includes the new variable `k`, which is equal to the number of elements in `divisors`, along with the unchanged states of `n`, `i`, and `divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `divisors` is a list containing all the divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n` and is not empty, and `k` is the number of elements in `divisors`.**
