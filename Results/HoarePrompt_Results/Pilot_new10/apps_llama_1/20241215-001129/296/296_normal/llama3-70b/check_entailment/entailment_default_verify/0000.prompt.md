You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 4, the program should print "YES" and provide a sequence of fractions that sum to 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. However, the program prints "YES" and then prints "1 2" and "1 4", which corresponds to the fractions 1/2 and 1/4, respectively. The sum of these fractions is 3/4, which is correct, but the program does not always produce a correct sequence of fractions for all inputs.

Another issue with the program is that it always prints "1" as the numerator for both fractions. This is not correct, as the problem statement allows for any positive integers a_i and b_i such that 1 ≤ a_i < b_i.

For example, when the input is 6, the program prints "YES" and then prints "1 3" and "1 6". However, a correct sequence of fractions for this input could also be "1 2" and "1 3", as shown in the example in the problem description.

The program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the sequence of fractions for all possible inputs, and it should not always print "1" as the numerator for both fractions. 

One way to solve this problem is to find all the divisors of n and then use a subset sum problem to find the correct sequence of fractions. Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)

        # Check if this sequence is correct
        sum_fractions = 1 / (n // 2) + 1 / n
        if sum_fractions!= 1 - 1 / n:
            print("Error in calculation")

func()
```

However, the previous code still does not work correctly for all cases. It only works for certain values of n where n // 2 and n are divisors of n.

A more general solution involves finding the proper divisors and then finding the right numerators.

```python
import math

def find_proper_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    return divisors

def find_sequence(n):
    divisors = find_proper_divisors(n)
    # Use a subset sum problem to find the correct sequence of fractions
    # This can be done using dynamic programming
    target = 1 - 1 / n
    for divisor in divisors:
        numerator = 1
        while numerator < divisor:
            fraction = numerator / divisor
            remaining = target - fraction
            for other_divisor in divisors:
                if other_divisor == divisor:
                    continue
                other_numerator = int(remaining * other_divisor)
                if other_numerator < other_divisor and other_numerator > 0:
                    if math.isclose(remaining, other_numerator / other_divisor):
                        return [(numerator, divisor), (other_numerator, other_divisor)]
            numerator += 1
    return None

def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        sequence = find_sequence(n)
        if sequence is not None:
            print('YES')
            print(len(sequence))
            for numerator, divisor in sequence:
                print(numerator, divisor)
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

In the previous Python code, `find_proper_divisors` finds all the proper divisors of `n`, and `find_sequence` uses these divisors to find a sequence of fractions that sum to `1 - 1/n`. If such a sequence is found, it is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function takes an integer `n` as input from the user, checks if `n` is equal to 2 and prints 'NO' if true, otherwise prints 'YES', 2, '1' and `n // 2`, and '1' and `n`, but does not return any value. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
