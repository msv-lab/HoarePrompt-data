The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it is mentioned that there is a constraint on a variable `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 1. But since this variable is not passed as a parameter to the function, we can't consider it as an input to the function.


Since there is no information about the return value of the function, we can't describe what the function returns.


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but the functionality description can't be completed due to lack of information about the return value.**
