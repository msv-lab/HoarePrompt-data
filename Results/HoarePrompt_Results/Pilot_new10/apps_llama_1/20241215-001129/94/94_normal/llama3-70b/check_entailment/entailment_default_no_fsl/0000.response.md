Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem description requires determining if there exists a sequence of moves that takes the puzzles to the same configuration. However, the provided code only checks if the grids are identical after swapping the 'X' values between the two grids. This approach is insufficient, as it does not consider all possible moves and configurations.

In the given code, the function `func_1` only swaps the 'X' values between the two grids, which does not simulate the actual movement of tiles. To correctly solve the problem, the code should generate all possible moves from the initial configurations and check if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.

For example, consider the initial configurations:

Bessie's puzzle:
AB
XC

Elsie's puzzle:
BA
CX

The given code will swap the 'X' values and compare the resulting configurations, which would be "ABXC" and "BACX". Since these are not identical, the code will print "NO". However, there exists a sequence of moves that can transform Bessie's puzzle into Elsie's puzzle, so the correct output should be "YES".

To fix this, the code should be modified to generate all possible moves from the initial configurations and check if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. One possible approach is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible configurations and check if the target configuration is reachable.
