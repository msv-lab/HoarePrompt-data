Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is 1. If the current value of the first element of `puzzle1` is 'X', then `x1` is 1. Additionally, if the current value of the element at index `i` (which is 1) of `puzzle2` is 'X', then `x2` is 0. If the current value of the first element of `puzzle1` is not 'X', then the state of `x1` is undefined and the rest of the variables retain their original state.***
