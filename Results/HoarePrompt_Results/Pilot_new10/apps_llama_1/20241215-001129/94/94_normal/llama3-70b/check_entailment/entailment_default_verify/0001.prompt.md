You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
    (puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2]) = (puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1])
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks if the two puzzles have the same set of tiles after swapping the empty cells, but it does not check if the tiles can be rearranged to the same configuration through a sequence of valid moves.

A counterexample is:

Input
AC
BX
AC
BX

The program will return 'YES' because the puzzles have the same set of tiles, but they cannot be rearranged to the same configuration through a sequence of valid moves because the 'A' and 'C' tiles are in the same positions in both puzzles, but the 'B' tile is in a different position.

The program should instead check all possible configurations that can be reached by moving the tiles in the puzzles and see if there is a common configuration. 

The correct solution should involve checking all possible permutations of the puzzles and seeing if they can be transformed into each other through a series of valid moves. 

Here is a brief outline of the correct approach:

1. Generate all possible permutations of the puzzle.
2. Check if any of these permutations match the given puzzle configurations.
3. If a match is found, return 'YES'.
4. If no match is found after checking all permutations, return 'NO'. 

The given code does not implement this approach and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two 2x2 grid parameters, each containing the strings 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', swaps the 'X' values between the two grids, and returns True if the grids are identical after swapping and False otherwise, but may raise an error if 'X' is not found in either grid. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
