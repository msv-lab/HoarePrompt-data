Postcondition: **`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is 2. If `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', then `x2` is 2. If `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', then `x1` is 2. If `puzzle1[i]` is not 'X', then `x1` is either 1 or undefined depending on the value of the first element of `puzzle1`. If `puzzle2[i]` is not 'X', then the state of `x2` is either 0 or 2 depending on the value of the element at index 2 of `puzzle2`.**
