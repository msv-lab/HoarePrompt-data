Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately determine if two given 2x2 puzzles can reach the same configuration through a sequence of moves (where a move involves sliding a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell).

The issue with the code is that it simply swaps the positions of the 'X' (empty cell) in the two puzzles and checks if the resulting puzzles are identical. However, this approach does not accurately model the possible moves in the puzzle.

A correct approach would involve checking if it's possible to transform one puzzle into the other through a sequence of valid moves. This could be achieved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm or a similar approach to explore all possible states of the puzzles and determine if a path exists between the initial states of the two puzzles.

In the given code, the function `func_1` does not actually perform the necessary checks to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. It simply swaps the 'X' values and checks if the resulting puzzles are sorted equally, which is not equivalent to checking if the puzzles can be transformed into each other through valid moves.

For example, consider the input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
The code would incorrectly output "YES" because it would swap the 'X' values and find that the sorted puzzles are equal. However, the correct output should be "NO" because there is no sequence of valid moves that can transform the first puzzle into the second puzzle.

Therefore, the code does not accurately solve the problem and should be considered incorrect.
