Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it does not correctly check if there exists a sequence of moves that takes the puzzles to the same configuration. 

The program simply swaps the 'X' position of the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted tiles are the same. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual sequence of moves that can be made.

For example, consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
The program will swap the 'X' position of the two puzzles, resulting in:
```
AB
XC
AX
BC
```
Then, it will check if the sorted tiles are the same, which they are. However, this does not mean that there exists a sequence of moves that takes the puzzles to the same configuration.

The correct approach would be to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves and check if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.

Here's an example of how the correct implementation could look:
```python
from collections import deque

def is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    # Define the possible moves
    moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

    # Convert the puzzles to a 1D list
    puzzle1 = list(puzzle1)
    puzzle2 = list(puzzle2)

    # Find the position of 'X' in each puzzle
    x1 = puzzle1.index('X')
    x2 = puzzle2.index('X')

    # Perform BFS
    queue = deque([(puzzle1, x1)])
    visited = set(tuple(puzzle1))

    while queue:
        curr_puzzle, curr_x = queue.popleft()

        # Check if the current puzzle is the same as puzzle2
        if curr_puzzle == puzzle2:
            return True

        # Generate all possible next states
        for dx, dy in moves:
            new_x = curr_x + dx + dy * 2
            if 0 <= new_x < 4 and abs(new_x // 2 - curr_x // 2) + abs(new_x % 2 - curr_x % 2) == 1:
                new_puzzle = curr_puzzle.copy()
                new_puzzle[curr_x], new_puzzle[new_x] = new_puzzle[new_x], new_puzzle[curr_x]
                new_puzzle_tuple = tuple(new_puzzle)

                # Check if the new state has been visited
                if new_puzzle_tuple not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_puzzle_tuple)
                    queue.append((new_puzzle, new_x))

    return False

puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')

if is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
This implementation correctly checks if there exists a sequence of moves that takes the puzzles to the same configuration.
