#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are 2D lists of strings, each representing a 2x2 grid, where each string is either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', and each grid contains exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2x2 grids each containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is 3, `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two 2x2 grid parameters, each containing the strings 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', swaps the 'X' values between the two grids, and returns True if the grids are identical after swapping and False otherwise, but may raise an error if 'X' is not found in either grid.
