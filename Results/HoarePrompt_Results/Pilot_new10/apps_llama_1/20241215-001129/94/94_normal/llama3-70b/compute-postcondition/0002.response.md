The code `x1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x1`. Since `i` is 0, `x1` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is 0, the current value of the first element of `puzzle1` is 'X', `x1` is 0**
