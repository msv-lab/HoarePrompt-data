According to the code, the loop will execute 4 times, regardless of the values of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. The loop variable `i` will take on the values 0, 1, 2, and 3. 

Since the loop will execute 4 times, `i` must be initialized to 0 before the loop starts. 

State: **`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is 0**
