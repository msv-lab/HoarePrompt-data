To determine the impact of the code on the program, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet provided.


The code provided is:
```python
new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
```
This line of code converts the `new_state` list into a string, `new_state_str`, by joining all the characters in the list.


Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.
- `queue` is a deque containing no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle.
- `visited` is a set containing the string `start`.
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is equal to `start`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2.
- `dr` is -1.
- `dc` is 0.
- `new_row` is 0.
- `new_col` is either 0 or 1.
- `new_pos` is either 0 or 1.
- `new_state` is a list where the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.


After executing the code, the only variable that changes is `new_state_str`, which becomes a string representation of `new_state`. The other variables retain their initial values.


Therefore, the Output State is:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.
- `queue` is a deque containing no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle.
- `visited` is a set containing the string `start`.
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is equal to `start`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2.
- `dr` is -1.
- `dc` is 0.
- `new_row` is 0.
- `new_col` is either 0 or 1.
- `new_pos` is either 0 or 1.
- `new_state` is a list where the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.
- `new_state_str` is a string where the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `current` are swapped.


Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is 0, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0 or 1, `new_state` is a list where the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string where the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `current` are swapped**
