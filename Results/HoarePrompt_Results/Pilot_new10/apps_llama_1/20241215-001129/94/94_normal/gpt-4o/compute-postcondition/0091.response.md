Postcondition: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str`, `queue` is not empty and its last element is either the original last element or updated to `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` equals `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` is not empty, `dr` and `dc` are the first elements of `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` equals `((empty_pos // 2) + dr) * 2 + ((empty_pos % 2) + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`.**
