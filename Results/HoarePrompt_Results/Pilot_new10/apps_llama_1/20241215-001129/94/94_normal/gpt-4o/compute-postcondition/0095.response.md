The value of `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. 
The value of `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
The `directions` has at least 2 elements, and `dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`. 
Therefore, `new_pos` equals `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 2 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**
