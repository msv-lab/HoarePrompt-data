Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the condition used to check if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The code checks if there is an intersection between the sets of reachable states from Bessie's and Elsie's puzzle configurations using the bitwise AND operator (&). However, this is not the correct condition to check if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration.

The correct condition should be to check if there is any common state in the sets of reachable states from Bessie's and Elsie's puzzle configurations. This can be done using the intersection of the two sets.

The annotation for the line `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:` suggests that this line checks if there are any common reachable states between the two puzzles, but the bitwise AND operator is not the correct way to do this. Instead, the code should use the `&` operator as a set intersection operator, like this: `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:` should be `if bessie_reachable.intersection(elsie_reachable):` or simply `if bessie_reachable and elsie_reachable:` is not correct either because it checks if both sets are not empty.

The correct check should be `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:` should be replaced with `if bessie_reachable.intersection(elsie_reachable):` 

Here is the correct code:

```python
bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
bessie_start = func_1(bessie_puzzle)
elsie_start = func_1(elsie_puzzle)
bessie_reachable = func_2(bessie_start)
elsie_reachable = func_2(elsie_start)
if bessie_reachable.intersection(elsie_reachable):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
``` 

However since sets in Python do have the intersection method but also the & operator does intersection as well I could argue that my initial claim was actually wrong because indeed bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable does perform the intersection of the two sets and thus the program actually does follow the problem description for every potential case.

Upon reviewing my initial claim, I realize I made a mistake. The & operator does perform the intersection of two sets in Python. Therefore, the code actually does follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
