Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos` is based on the updated `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` are updated to include `new_state_str`, and `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped. Otherwise, no updates are made to `queue`, `visited`, or `new_state`.***
