To determine the output state after the execution of the given Python code, let's consider the impact of the code on the program.

1. `queue.append(new_state_str)`: This line of code adds `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once,
- `queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries,
- `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and `new_state_str`,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to `start`,
- `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`,
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2,
- `dr` is 0,
- `dc` is -1,
- `new_row` is `empty_row`,
- `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`,
- `new_pos` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial position of 'X',
- `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character at index `new_pos` in the original `new_state` list and `new_state[new_pos]` is 'X',
- `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once,

The code appends `new_state_str` to `queue`, which means `queue` now contains its previous elements plus `new_state_str`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `append` operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once,
- `queue` is a deque containing its previous elements and `new_state_str`,
- `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and `new_state_str`,
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)],
- `current` is equal to `start`,
- `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`,
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2,
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2,
- `dr` is 0,
- `dc` is -1,
- `new_row` is `empty_row`,
- `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`,
- `new_pos` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial position of 'X',
- `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character at index `new_pos` in the original `new_state` list and `new_state[new_pos]` is 'X',
- `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing its previous elements and `new_state_str`, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and `new_state_str`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial position of 'X', `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character at index `new_pos` in the original `new_state` list and `new_state[new_pos]` is 'X', `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once**
