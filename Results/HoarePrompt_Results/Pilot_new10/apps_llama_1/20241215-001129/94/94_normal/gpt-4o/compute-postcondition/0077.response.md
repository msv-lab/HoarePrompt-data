According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is empty if all reachable states have been visited. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `queue` must not be empty, meaning there must be at least one more reachable state that has not been visited yet.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty, `current` is the last state processed, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are determined by the last `current` state, and `directions` remains unchanged**
