The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` converts the list `new_state` into a string `new_state_str` by joining all elements of the list into a single string.

The initial state is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, 
`queue` is one element shorter and not empty, 
`current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` equals `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` equals `empty_pos % 2`, 
`directions` is not empty, 
`dr` and `dc` are the first elements of `directions`, 
`new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` equals `((empty_pos // 2) + dr) * 2 + ((empty_pos % 2) + dc)`, 
and `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

After executing the code, `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which is a string representation of the list `new_state`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is one element shorter and not empty, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` equals `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` is not empty, `dr` and `dc` are the first elements of `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` equals `((empty_pos // 2) + dr) * 2 + ((empty_pos % 2) + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, and `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`**
