Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_col`, if `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` then `new_pos` is `empty_pos + 2` interpreted within valid moves, `new_state` is the result of swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, and `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `queue` and `visited`.***
