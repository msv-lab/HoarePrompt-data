The value of `queue` is changed as it now contains `new_state_str` as its last element, in addition to the elements it already had, and it is still not empty. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, including `new_state_str`, `queue` is not empty and its last element is `new_state_str`, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` equals `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` is not empty, `dr` and `dc` are the first elements of `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` equals `((empty_pos // 2) + dr) * 2 + ((empty_pos % 2) + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`.
