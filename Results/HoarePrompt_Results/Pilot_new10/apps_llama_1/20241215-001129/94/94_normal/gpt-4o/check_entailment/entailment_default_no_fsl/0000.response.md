Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The main issue is with the condition in the last line of the code. The `&` operator in Python is a bitwise AND operator, not a logical AND operator. It should be replaced with `and`. 

However, even with the correct operator, the condition `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:` (or `if bessie_reachable and elsie_reachable:`) is still incorrect. This condition checks if both `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable` are truthy, but it does not check if there is any common element between `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable`. 

To fix this, we should check if there is any common element between `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable`. We can do this using the `&` operator on sets, like this: `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
bessie_start = func_1(bessie_puzzle)
elsie_start = func_1(elsie_puzzle)
bessie_reachable = func_2(bessie_start)
elsie_reachable = func_2(elsie_start)
if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

In this corrected code, `bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable` will be a set containing all elements that are common to both `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable`. If this set is not empty, it means that there is at least one common configuration between `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable`, so we print 'YES'. Otherwise, we print 'NO'.
