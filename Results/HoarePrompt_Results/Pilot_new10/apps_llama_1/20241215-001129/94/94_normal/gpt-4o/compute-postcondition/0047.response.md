The value of `new_pos` is determined by the expression `new_row * 2 + new_col`, where `new_row` and `new_col` are the results of adding a direction (`dr`, `dc`) to the row and column of the 'X' position in the `current` state, and their values are such that `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`. The values of `queue`, `visited`, `start`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` do not change as a result of the code.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed, `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the removed state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are true.**
