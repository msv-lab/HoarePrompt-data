Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one more direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` and `visited` are updated to include `new_state_str` in addition to their previous values, and `new_state` is a list where the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, and `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
