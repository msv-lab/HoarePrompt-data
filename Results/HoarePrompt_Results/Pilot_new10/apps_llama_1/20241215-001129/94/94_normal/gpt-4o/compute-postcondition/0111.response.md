Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str`, `queue` is not empty and contains `new_state_str` as its last element, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 3 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the third elements of `directions`, `new_row` = `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` = `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` = (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' where 'X' is at `new_pos`, `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, where 'X' is at the position `new_pos`.***
