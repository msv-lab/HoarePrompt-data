The function func_2 accepts a string parameter `start` representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states of the puzzle. The algorithm works by maintaining a queue of states to visit and a set of visited states. It starts with the initial state and iteratively generates all possible next states by moving the 'X' (empty space) in all four directions (up, down, left, right) if the move is valid.

The function returns a set of all unique reachable states from the original puzzle configuration `start`. However, it does not provide any information about the shortest path to each state or the sequence of moves required to reach each state.

It is also worth noting that the function does not handle any invalid inputs, such as a string of length not equal to 4, or a string that does not contain the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once. In such cases, the function may not work as expected or may raise an exception.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle and returns a set of all unique reachable states from this configuration, assuming the input is valid and the puzzle is solvable, but does not provide any information about the sequence of moves required to reach each state and does not handle invalid inputs. **
