Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 2 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, and `queue` contains all previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, where `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, and `new_state` is a copy of `current` with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped***
