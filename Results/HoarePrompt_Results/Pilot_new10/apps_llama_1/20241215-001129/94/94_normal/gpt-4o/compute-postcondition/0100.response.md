The given code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. 

The value of `queue` is updated by appending `new_state_str` to it. 

All other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far including `new_state_str`, `queue` is not empty and contains all previous elements and `new_state_str`, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 2 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far including `new_state_str`, `queue` is not empty and contains all previous elements and `new_state_str`, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 2 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once**
