To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code snippet on the variables.

The code snippet is swapping the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. 

Given that `new_pos` equals `((empty_pos // 2) + dr) * 2 + ((empty_pos % 2) + dc)`, this operation effectively moves the 'X' (represented by `empty_pos`) to a new position (`new_pos`) in the `new_state`.

As a result, the value of `new_state` is updated, and the positions of the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

The states of the other variables (`start`, `visited`, `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `directions`, `dr`, `dc`, `new_row`, `new_col`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, 
`queue` is one element shorter and not empty, 
`current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` equals `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` equals `empty_pos % 2`, 
`directions` is not empty, 
`dr` and `dc` are the first elements of `directions`, 
`new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` equals `((empty_pos // 2) + dr) * 2 + ((empty_pos % 2) + dc)`, 
and `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is one element shorter and not empty, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` equals `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` equals `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` is not empty, `dr` and `dc` are the first elements of `directions`, `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` equals `((empty_pos // 2) + dr) * 2 + ((empty_pos % 2) + dc)`, and `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.**
