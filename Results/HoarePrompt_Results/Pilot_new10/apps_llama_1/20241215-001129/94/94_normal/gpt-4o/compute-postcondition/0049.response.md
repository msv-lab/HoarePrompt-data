The value of `new_state[empty_pos]` becomes the value of `new_state[new_pos]`, and the value of `new_state[new_pos]` becomes the value of `new_state[empty_pos]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `new_state` is a list copy of `current`, `new_state` now contains the characters of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped. The rest of the variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed, `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the removed state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` are true, and `new_state` is a list where the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` of `current` are swapped.
