To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once,
- `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far,
- `queue` is not empty,
- `current` may be updated,
- `empty_pos` may be updated,
- `empty_row` may be updated,
- `empty_col` may be updated,
- `directions` has at least 2 elements,
- `dr` and `dc` are the second elements of `directions`,
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`,
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`,
- If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, and `queue` contains all previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.

Loop statement: `for (dr, dc) in directions:`

Since `dr` and `dc` were the second elements of `directions` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, they need to move to the next elements in `directions`. Given that `directions` has at least 2 elements and assuming it is iterated sequentially, the next iteration will use the third elements of `directions` as `dr` and `dc`.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, `queue` is not empty, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 3 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the third elements of `directions`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, and `queue` contains all previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.**
