The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. The previous values of `new_state_str` and `visited` are used to calculate the new state.

Given the initial state, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries. The code will add `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. 

Other variables such as `start`, `queue`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, `dc`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and `new_state_str`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial position of 'X', `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character at index `new_pos` in the original `new_state` list and `new_state[new_pos]` is 'X', `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once**
