The code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` assigns the index of 'X' in the string `current` to the variable `empty_pos`. The string `current` is of length 4 and contains the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed, `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the removed state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by the position of 'X' in the new `current` state**
