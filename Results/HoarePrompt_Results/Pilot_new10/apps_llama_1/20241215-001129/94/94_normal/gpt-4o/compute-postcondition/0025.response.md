The line of code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. Other variables are not affected. 

`new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, which is the result of swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`queue` is a deque containing either no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, 
`visited` is a set containing the string `start`, the string representation of the initial state of the puzzle after swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, and possibly other strings, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to `start`, 
`empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, 
`dr` is 1, 
`dc` is 0, 
`new_row` is `empty_row + 1`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col`, 
`new_pos` is `empty_pos + 2` interpreted within valid moves, 
`new_state` is the result of swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, 
`new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`.
