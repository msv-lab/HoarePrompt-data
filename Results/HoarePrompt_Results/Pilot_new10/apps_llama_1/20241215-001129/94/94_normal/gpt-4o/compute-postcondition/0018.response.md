Postcondition: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly a new string if the new position is within the boundaries and the new string was not already in `visited`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, if `new_row` is within the boundaries, `new_row` is 0, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0 or 1, and if the new state string is not in `visited`, then `queue` contains the new state string and `visited` contains `start` and the new state string, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**
