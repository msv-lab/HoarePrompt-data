To calculate the new state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet:

Given Initial State:
- `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.
- `queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries.
- `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries.
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is equal to `start`.
- `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2.
- `dr` is 0.
- `dc` is -1.
- `new_row` is `empty_row`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
```

Now, let's calculate `new_pos` based on the given values of `new_row` and `new_col`.

Given that `new_row` is `empty_row` and `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, and considering `empty_row` and `empty_col` are derived from `empty_pos` (the initial index of 'X' in `current`), we must first determine the value of `empty_pos`.

Since `start` contains 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once and is of length 4, let's assume 'X' can be in any of these positions. However, without a specific arrangement, we'll consider the general formula to calculate `new_pos`.

The position `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`, where `new_row` equals `empty_row` (which is `empty_pos // 2`) and `new_col` equals `empty_col - 1` (where `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`).

Let's consider the possible positions of 'X' and their implications:
1. If 'X' is at position 0 (`empty_pos = 0`), then `empty_row = 0`, `empty_col = 0`, `new_row = 0`, and `new_col = -1`. In this case, `new_pos = 0 * 2 + (-1) = -1`.
2. If 'X' is at position 1 (`empty_pos = 1`), then `empty_row = 0`, `empty_col = 1`, `new_row = 0`, and `new_col = 0`. In this case, `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 0 = 0`.
3. If 'X' is at position 2 (`empty_pos = 2`), then `empty_row = 1`, `empty_col = 0`, `new_row = 1`, and `new_col = -1`. In this case, `new_pos = 1 * 2 + (-1) = 1`.
4. If 'X' is at position 3 (`empty_pos = 3`), then `empty_row = 1`, `empty_col = 1`, `new_row = 1`, and `new_col = 0`. In this case, `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 0 = 2`.

Considering these scenarios, `new_pos` can be -1, 0, 1, or 2, depending on the initial position of 'X' in `start`.

The states of the other variables (`queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`) remain unchanged by the execution of the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State, considering the possible values of `new_pos` based on the position of 'X', is:

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, and `new_pos` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial position of 'X'.**
