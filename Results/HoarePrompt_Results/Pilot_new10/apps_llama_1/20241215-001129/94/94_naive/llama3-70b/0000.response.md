Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The issue with the program is in the `func_1` function, where it attempts to swap the positions of the empty cells ('X') in the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted tiles are the same. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual moves required to transform one puzzle into the other.

The program does not actually perform the necessary steps to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. It only checks if the tiles are the same when sorted, which is not sufficient. The correct solution would involve implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial configurations and check if the two puzzles can ever reach the same configuration.

A counterexample where the program does not work correctly is:

Input:
AB
XC
AX
BC

In this case, the program would incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly implement the logic to transform one puzzle into the other.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a search algorithm that explores all possible moves and checks if the two puzzles can ever reach the same configuration. The correct solution would involve a more complex implementation that takes into account the actual moves required to transform one puzzle into the other. 

A correct implementation would consider all possible moves (up, down, left, right) for the empty cell and recursively check if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. 

Here is a high-level example of a correct implementation:
```python
from collections import deque

def is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    queue = deque([(puzzle1, puzzle2)])
    visited = set((puzzle1, puzzle2))

    while queue:
        p1, p2 = queue.popleft()

        if p1 == p2:
            return True

        for i in range(4):
            if p1[i] == 'X':
                x1 = i
            if p2[i] == 'X':
                x2 = i

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx1, ny1 = divmod(x1 + dx * 2 + dy, 2)
            nx2, ny2 = divmod(x2 + dx * 2 + dy, 2)

            if 0 <= nx1 < 2 and 0 <= ny1 < 2:
                np1 = list(p1)
                np1[x1], np1[nx1*2 + ny1] = np1[nx1*2 + ny1], np1[x1]
                np1 = ''.join(np1)

                if (np1, p2) not in visited:
                    queue.append((np1, p2))
                    visited.add((np1, p2))

            if 0 <= nx2 < 2 and 0 <= ny2 < 2:
                np2 = list(p2)
                np2[x2], np2[nx2*2 + ny2] = np2[nx2*2 + ny2], np2[x2]
                np2 = ''.join(np2)

                if (p1, np2) not in visited:
                    queue.append((p1, np2))
                    visited.add((p1, np2))

    return False

puzzle1 = input() + input()
puzzle2 = input() + input()

if is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial configurations and checks if the two puzzles can ever reach the same configuration. If the puzzles can reach the same configuration, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
