The value of `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`min_speed` was the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`, so now it is the minimum of the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed` plus `d`, and `max_speed`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`v1` is an input integer, 
`v2` is an input integer, 
`t` is an input integer greater than 1, 
`d` is an input integer, 
`max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, 
`min_speed` is the minimum of the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed` plus `d`, and `max_speed`, 
`max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, 
`min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + min(min(v1, v2) + d, max_speed)`, 
and `i` is `t - 2`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed` plus `d`, and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + min(min(v1, v2) + d, max_speed)`, and `i` is `t - 2`**
