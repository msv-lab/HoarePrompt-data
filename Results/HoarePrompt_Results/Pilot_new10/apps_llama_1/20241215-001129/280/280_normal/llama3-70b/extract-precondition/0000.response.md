Precondition: **v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 2 and 100, and d is an integer between 0 and 10, such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the first speed equals v_1, the last speed equals v_2, and the absolute difference between any two adjacent speeds does not exceed d.**
