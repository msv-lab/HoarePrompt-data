The function `func` accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10. The return value is based on whether there exists a sequence of speeds where the first speed equals `v_1`, the last speed equals `v_2`, and the absolute difference between any two adjacent speeds does not exceed `d`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters v_1, v_2, t, and d, and returns whether a sequence of speeds exists with the given constraints.**
