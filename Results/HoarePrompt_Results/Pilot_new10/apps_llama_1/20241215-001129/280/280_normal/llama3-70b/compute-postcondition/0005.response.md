`min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed * t`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed` are not changed by this line of code. The value of `max_length` is also not changed. 
The value of `min_length` is now equal to `min(v1, v2) * t`, which is the minimum speed multiplied by time. 

The other variables maintain their initial conditions: 
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`
- `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t`

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`, `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t**
