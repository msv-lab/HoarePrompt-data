The value of `max_speed` is updated to be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. The previous value of `max_speed` was the maximum of `v1` and `v2`. The value of `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`v1` is an input integer, 
`v2` is an input integer, 
`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, 
`d` is an input integer, 
`max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, 
`min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, 
`max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`, 
`min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t`, 
`i` is `t - 1`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`, `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
