To determine the output state after the given code is executed, let's break down what the code does and analyze its impact on the variables.

Given code: `max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`

This line of code updates the value of `max_speed` to be the maximum of two values: `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.

Initial State:
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer greater than 2
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed` plus `d`, and `max_speed`
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2)) + max_speed`
- `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + min(min(v1, v2) + d, max_speed) + min_speed`
- `i` is `t - 3`

After executing the code:
- The value of `max_speed` is updated to be `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`. Given that `max_speed` initially is defined in terms of itself and `min_speed`, this operation essentially ensures that `max_speed` is at least as large as `min_speed` after subtracting `d` from it. If `max_speed - d` is less than `min_speed`, then `max_speed` will be set to `min_speed`, effectively increasing it. If `max_speed - d` is greater than or equal to `min_speed`, then `max_speed` remains unchanged because `max_speed - d` is already greater than or equal to `min_speed`, and the equation degenerates to `max_speed = max_speed`.
- The definitions of `min_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` depend on the initial values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed`. Since the code only updates `max_speed`, we need to consider how this update affects `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `min_length` indirectly through `max_speed`.

However, given the initial state's definitions of `max_speed` and `min_speed` already imply a relationship that the code seeks to enforce, the update primarily ensures that `max_speed` is indeed not less than `min_speed` after considering the subtraction of `d`. 

Since `min_speed` is defined in terms of `max_speed` plus `d` and `min(v1, v2) + d`, and `max_speed` is updated to ensure it's not less than `min_speed` after subtracting `d`, the relationship between `max_speed` and `min_speed` remains consistent with their initial definitions. 

`max_length` and `min_length` include `max_speed` in their calculations, so their values would be directly affected by any change in `max_speed`. However, without specific numerical values for `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, and the initial `max_speed` and `min_speed`, we cannot calculate exact new values for `max_length` and `min_length` but acknowledge that `max_speed`'s update could influence them.

`i` remains unchanged as `t - 3`, since the code does not affect `t` or `i`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer greater than 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of its previous value minus `d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed` plus `d`, and `max_speed`, `max_length` is potentially updated based on the new `max_speed`, `min_length` is potentially updated based on the new `max_speed`, and `i` is `t - 3`**
