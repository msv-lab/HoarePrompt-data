To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the impact of the code snippet `min_length += min_speed` on the variables.

Initial State:
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer greater than 2
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum of its previous value minus `d` and the new `min_speed`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`
- `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`
- `i` is `t - 3`
- `min_length` is initially not defined in terms of an equation but is impacted by `min_speed`

The code snippet `min_length += min_speed` directly affects `min_length` by adding the current value of `min_speed` to it.

Given the initial state definitions:
- The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `i` are not directly altered by the operation `min_length += min_speed`.
- `min_length` is updated by adding `min_speed` to its previous value.

Therefore, the output state, considering the direct impact of the code and retaining the initial conditions where applicable, is:
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer greater than 2
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum of its previous value minus `d` and the new `min_speed`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`
- `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`
- `i` is `t - 3`
- `min_length` is its previous value plus `min_speed`

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer greater than 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of its previous value minus `d` and the new `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, and `min_length` is its previous value plus `min_speed`.**
