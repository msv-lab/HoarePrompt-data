To determine the output state, we need to consider the changes made by the code snippet to the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 1
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`
- `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t`
- `i` is `t - 1`

The code executes the following line:
```python
max_length += max_speed
```
This means `max_length` is increased by the value of `max_speed`.

After this operation, the state of the variables changes as follows:
- `v1` remains an input integer
- `v2` remains an input integer
- `t` remains an input integer greater than 1
- `d` remains an input integer
- `max_speed` remains the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`
- `min_speed` remains the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`
- `max_length` becomes `max(v1, v2) * t + max_speed`
- `min_length` remains `min(v1, v2) * t`
- `i` remains `t - 1`

Since `max_speed` is defined as the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, let's express it in terms of `v1`, `v2`, and `d` for clarity in the final state. The expression for `max_length` would then be more accurately represented as:
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`

Therefore, considering all variables and their updated values or expressions:
Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t`, and `i` is `t - 1`**
