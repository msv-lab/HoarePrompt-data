The code takes two integer inputs, assigns them to `v1` and `v2` respectively, which were initially represented as `v_1` and `v_2`. 

Since `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values from the input, we know they are integers and their values are determined by the input provided by the user.

The states of `t` and `d` are not affected by this code snippet. 

Given the new information, the output state is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10**
