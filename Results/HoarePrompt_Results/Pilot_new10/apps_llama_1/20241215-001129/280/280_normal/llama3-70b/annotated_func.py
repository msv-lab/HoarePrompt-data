#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 2 and 100, and d is an integer between 0 and 10, such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the first speed equals v_1, the last speed equals v_2, and the absolute difference between any two adjacent speeds does not exceed d.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        
        max_length += max_speed
        
        min_length += min_speed
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the result of iteratively adjusting the maximum of `v1` and `v2` by `d` over `t - 1` iterations while ensuring it does not go below `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the result of iteratively adjusting the minimum of `v1` and `v2` by `d` over `t - 1` iterations while ensuring it does not exceed `max_speed`, `max_length` is the accumulation of `max_speed` values over `t` (including the initial `max(v1, v2) * t`), and `min_length` is the accumulation of `min_speed` values over `t` (including the initial `min(v1, v2) * t`), with the loop's execution dependent on `t` being greater than 1.
    print(max_length)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the maximum possible distance (`max_length`) that can be traveled under given constraints, including initial and final speeds (`v1` and `v2`), time (`t`), and maximum speed difference per time unit (`d`), but does not explicitly verify the existence of a valid sequence of speeds as suggested by the annotations.
