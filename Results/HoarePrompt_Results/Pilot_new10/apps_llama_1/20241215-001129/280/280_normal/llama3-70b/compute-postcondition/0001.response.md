The code `t, d = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `t` and `d` based on the input provided. 

`t` is assigned an integer value from the input, but its previous constraint of being between 2 and 100 is not guaranteed to hold after this operation. 

`d` is similarly assigned an integer value from the input, and its previous constraint of being between 0 and 10 is also not guaranteed to hold after this operation.

The values of `v1` and `v2` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
