The function reads two initial and final speeds, time, and acceleration, calculates a list of speeds based on these inputs where each subsequent speed is the minimum of the previous speed plus acceleration and the final speed plus acceleration times the remaining time, and prints the total distance traveled by summing up these speeds.
