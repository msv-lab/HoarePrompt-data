The code `v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `v1` and `v2` by taking two integers as input from the user. 

The values of `t` and `d` are not affected by this code. 

The initial state constraints on `v1` and `v2` (1 <= v_1, v_2 <= 100) are no longer applicable as their values are updated based on the user's input. 

However, the constraints on `t` (2 <= t <= 100) and `d` (0 <= d <= 10) remain the same.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 <= d <= 10**
