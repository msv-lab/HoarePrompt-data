The value of `count` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial state has `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 12`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` can be any value greater than or equal to -4.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 12`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `count` is increased by 1**
