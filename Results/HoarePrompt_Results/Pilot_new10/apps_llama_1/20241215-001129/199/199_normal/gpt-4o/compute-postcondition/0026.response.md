The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function returns a value based on the conditions met for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`. If none of the conditions are met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the number of times the conditions `n - 4 * a > 0`, `n - 4 * a` is even, and `a` is not equal to `(n - 4 * a) // 2` are met. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the count of specific conditions being met for a range of values, or 0 if none of the conditions are met.
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, returns 0 if no conditions are met, or the count of conditions where `n - 4 * a > 0`, `n - 4 * a` is even, and `a` is not equal to `(n - 4 * a) // 2` for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`.**
