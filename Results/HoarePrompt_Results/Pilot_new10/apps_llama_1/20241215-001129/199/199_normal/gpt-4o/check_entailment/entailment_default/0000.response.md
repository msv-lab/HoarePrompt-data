Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given code only considers cases where two pairs of parts have the same length. However, it does not account for cases where all four parts have different lengths but can still form a rectangle (e.g., a, b, a, b or a, b, b, a). 

In particular, the code only checks for the condition where `a` is equal to `b` and does not consider all possible combinations of pairs of parts with the same length that can form a rectangle. This oversight leads to an undercount of valid ways to split the stick.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible ways to split the stick into four parts and check if the parts can form a rectangle but not a square. The provided code does not handle this correctly, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
