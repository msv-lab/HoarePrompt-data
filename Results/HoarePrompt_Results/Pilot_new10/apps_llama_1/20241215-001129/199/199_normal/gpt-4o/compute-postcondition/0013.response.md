The code assigns the value of `a` to `b`. The initial value of `a` is 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is still `n - 4`, and `a` is still 2. 

However, the value of `b` changes to 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 4`, `a` is 2, `b` is 2**
