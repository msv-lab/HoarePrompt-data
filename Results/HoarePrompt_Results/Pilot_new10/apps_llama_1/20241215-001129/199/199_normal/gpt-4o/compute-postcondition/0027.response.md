The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns an integer value. 

Let's break down the functionality step by step:

- If `n` is less than 6, the function immediately returns 0. 
- If `n` is 6 or greater, the function initializes a counter `count` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 4` (inclusive). 
- For each iteration, it sets `b` to the current iteration value `a`, calculates the remainder `rem` as `n - 2 * (a + b)`, and checks if `rem` is greater than 0 and even. 
- If `rem` is greater than 0, even, and not equal to `a` (since `b` is set to `a`), it increments the `count`. 
- After iterating over the entire range, the function returns the `count`, which represents the number of times the specified conditions are met.

The function does not explicitly handle any potential edge cases such as non-integer or non-positive input values for `n`. However, based on the provided code, it seems that such cases are not considered.

Therefore, considering all potential cases and the actual code, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is less than 6, or the count of integers `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4` where `n - 4 * a > 0`, `n - 4 * a` is even, and `a` is not equal to `(n - 4 * a) // 2`, otherwise **
