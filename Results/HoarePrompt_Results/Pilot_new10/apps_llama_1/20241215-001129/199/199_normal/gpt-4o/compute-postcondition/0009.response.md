The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 1, `rem` is `n - 4`, `rem` is greater than 0, `rem` is an even number, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `a` is not equal to half of the current value of `rem`**
