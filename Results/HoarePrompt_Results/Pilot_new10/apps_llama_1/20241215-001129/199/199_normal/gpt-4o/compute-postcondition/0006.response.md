The code calculates the remainder `rem` by subtracting twice the sum of `a` and `b` from `n`. Given `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1, we can substitute these values into the equation.

`rem = n - 2 * (a + b)`
`rem = n - 2 * (1 + 1)`
`rem = n - 2 * 2`
`rem = n - 4`

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 6, the minimum value of `n - 4` is 2 (when `n` is 6), and it increases as `n` increases.

The states of `n`, `count`, `a`, and `b` are not changed by this operation. Only a new variable `rem` is introduced, which is equal to `n - 4`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is `n - 4`**
