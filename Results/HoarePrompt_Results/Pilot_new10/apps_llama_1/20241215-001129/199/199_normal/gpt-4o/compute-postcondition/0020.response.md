To determine the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given Python code snippet affects it.

Initial State: 
- `n` is greater than or equal to 8
- `rem` is `n - 8`
- `a` is 3
- `b` is 3

Given Code:
```python
rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
```

Now, let's calculate the new value of `rem` based on the given code and initial state.

Given that `a` is 3 and `b` is 3, the expression `a + b` equals 6. So, `2 * (a + b)` equals `2 * 6`, which is 12.

Thus, `rem` is updated to `n - 12`.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as the code only updates the value of `rem`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 12`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3**
