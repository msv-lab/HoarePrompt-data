You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It correctly counts the number of ways to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The program uses a brute-force approach to iterate over all possible lengths of the stick parts and checks if it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square. The function `func_1(n)` takes the length of the stick `n` as input and returns the count of such ways.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- It first checks if `n` is less than 6. If so, it returns 0, as it's impossible to split the stick into four parts of positive integer length.

- It then iterates over all possible lengths `a` from 1 to `n // 4` (inclusive), which represents one pair of equal-length parts.

- For each `a`, it calculates `rem = n - 2 * (a + a)`, which represents the remaining length after removing the two pairs of equal-length parts.

- If `rem` is greater than 0 and divisible by 2 (i.e., `rem % 2 == 0`), it means we have a valid pair of equal-length parts.

- However, to avoid forming a square, it checks if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If this condition is true, it increments the count.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the examples provided in the problem description demonstrate its correctness. The program's output for the given examples (6 and 20) matches the expected output. 

After reviewing the code, it seems to be correct and should work as expected for all inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is less than 6, or the count of integers `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4` where `n - 4 * a > 0`, `n - 4 * a` is even, and `a` is not equal to `(n - 4 * a) // 2`, otherwise 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
