According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `n`, and `b`. The loop iterates over a range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. For this loop to execute, `a` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, and since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and `a` is 1, this condition is met. 

At the start of the loop, `b` should be equal to `a`, which is 1. The state of `ways` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop's execution. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1**
