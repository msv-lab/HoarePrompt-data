To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over `b` in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. For each `b`, it checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. If both conditions are true, it increments `ways` by 1.

The initial state sets `a` to 3, `b` to `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, and `ways` to the number of pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `2 * (a + b) == n`. 

From the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can observe the following patterns:
- `a` remains constant at 3.
- `b` increments by 1 in each iteration, starting from `a` (which is 3) up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
- `n` must be at least 5, and for each iteration, `n` needs to be at least as large as `2 * (a + b)` for the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` to potentially be satisfied.
- `ways` is incremented by 1 for each `b` where `a!= b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`.

After all iterations, `b` will have reached its maximum value within the given range, which is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. However, the key focus is on how `ways` is updated based on the conditions.

The final value of `ways` will be the initial number of pairs satisfying `2 * (a + b) == n` plus the number of iterations where `a!= b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`. Since `a` is fixed at 3, and the loop checks all possible `b` values from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `ways` essentially counts how many pairs `(3, b)` satisfy `2 * (3 + b) == n`, excluding cases where `a == b` (which only happens when `b` is 3).

Considering the loop's range and conditions, and given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, the final state of `ways` will accurately reflect the total number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is 3, and `2 * (a + b) == n`, with `b` ranging from 3 up to `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, excluding any case where `a == b` if such cases existed within the satisfying conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is 3, `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, and `ways` is the total number of pairs `(3, b)` where `b` ranges from 3 to `(n - 3) // 2 + 1` and `2 * (3 + b) == n`, excluding cases where `3 == b` if they don't satisfy the equation due to the increment condition.**
