The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 4 and returns the number of distinct positive integer pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is from 1 to `n//2`, `b` is from `a` to `(n-a)//2`, and `2*(a+b)` equals `n`, or returns 0 if no such pairs exist, and may not be well-defined for `n` less than 4 or for non-integer or non-positive inputs
