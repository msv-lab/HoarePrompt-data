According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, the loop can execute. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`, so the variable `a` will be initialized to 1 before the loop starts.

At the start of the loop, `a` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4. The variable `ways` is 0, but it does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
