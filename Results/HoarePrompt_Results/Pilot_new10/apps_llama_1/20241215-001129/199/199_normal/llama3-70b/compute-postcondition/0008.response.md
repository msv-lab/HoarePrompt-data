Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, `b` is 2. If `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 * (a + b) equals `n`, then if `n` equals 6, `a` + `b` equals `n` / 2 and `ways` is 2, otherwise `ways` is incremented by 1 from its initial state. If `a` equals `b` or 2 * (a + b) does not equal `n`, then the state of `ways`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged, with `a` + `b` not necessarily equal to `n` / 2 and `ways` is either 1 if the initial conditions of `a` not equal to `b` and 2 * (a + b) equals `n` were met before the if statement, or remains in its initial state if those conditions were not met***
