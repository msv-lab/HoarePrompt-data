According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is at its maximum value in the given range, which is `(n - a) // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
