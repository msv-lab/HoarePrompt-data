Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The problem asks to count the number of ways to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square. The provided code calculates the number of distinct positive integer pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is from 1 to `n//2`, `b` is from `a` to `(n-a)//2`, and `2*(a+b)` equals `n`.

The code assumes that to form a rectangle, two pairs of parts must have the same length, and to avoid forming a square, the two pairs must have different lengths. The condition `a!= b` ensures this.

The loops over `a` and `b` iterate over all possible combinations of part lengths that satisfy the conditions. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of the lengths of the four parts equals `n`.

The examples provided in the problem description, such as the inputs `6` and `20`, yield the correct outputs using this code, which further supports its correctness.

The output hints agree with the code, confirming that it returns the number of distinct positive integer pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions.

Overall, the code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and there are no apparent cases where it does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
