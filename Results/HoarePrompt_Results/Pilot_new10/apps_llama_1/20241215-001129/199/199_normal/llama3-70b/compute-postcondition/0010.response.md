The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. However, the initial value of `ways` is not provided in the initial state. The initial state only provides information about `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, and `b` is 3, and the code does not affect these variables, their values remain the same. 

The value of `ways` is increased by 1, but its initial value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, and `ways` is increased by 1 from its initial value.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, and `ways` is its initial value + 1**
