Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the program works and why it's correct:

1. The program takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the length of the stick.
2. The function `func_1(n)` is called with `n` as an argument.
3. Inside `func_1(n)`, two nested loops are used to iterate over all possible pairs of distinct positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is in the range from 1 to `n // 2` and `b` is in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
4. For each pair `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. This is the condition for forming a rectangle using the four parts of the stick (two parts of length `a` and two parts of length `b`), but not a square (since `a` and `b` are distinct).
5. If the condition is met, the program increments the `ways` counter by 1.
6. After the loops finish, the program returns the total number of ways to split the stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square.

The program correctly implements the problem description because:

* It iterates over all possible pairs of distinct positive integers `(a, b)` that can form a rectangle using the four parts of the stick.
* It checks the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` to ensure that the four parts can be combined to form a rectangle with perimeter `n`.
* It excludes the case where `a == b`, which would result in a square instead of a rectangle.

Therefore, the program correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square, and returns this count as the result.
