According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a` and `n`. If `a` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is 2, and `b` is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be increased by 1. So, `a` becomes 3. 

Since `a` is now 3, `b` should also be updated to `(n - a) // 2 + 1` with the new value of `a`. Now `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`. The value of `ways` remains the same for now because we don't have enough information about how `ways` is updated inside the loop body.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is 3, `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, and `ways` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `2 * (a + b) == n`**
