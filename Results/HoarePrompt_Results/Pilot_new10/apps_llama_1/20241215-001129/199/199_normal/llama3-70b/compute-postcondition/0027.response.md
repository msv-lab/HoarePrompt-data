Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, the current values of `a` and `b` are not equal, and the sum of `a` and `b` multiplied by 2 equals `n`. `ways` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `2 * (a + b) == n`, which in this case includes the current pair `(a, b)` since they satisfy the condition.**
