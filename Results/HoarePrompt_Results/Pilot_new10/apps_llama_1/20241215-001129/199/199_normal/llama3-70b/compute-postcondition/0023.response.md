Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 4. If `n` equals 12, then `ways` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged, given that the initial condition of `a` not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n` is met. If this condition is not met, `ways` remains unchanged.***
