Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly solve the problem. The problem requires us to find the number of ways to split a stick into four parts such that it is possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but impossible to form a square.

The program uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible lengths of the stick's parts, `a` and `b`, where `a <= b`. It checks the condition `2 * (a + b) == n`, which ensures that the sum of the lengths of the four parts is equal to `n` and that it is possible to form a rectangle (since `a + b` is the length of one side of the rectangle and the other side is also `a + b`).

Additionally, the condition `a!= b` ensures that it is impossible to form a square, because if `a` were equal to `b`, then all four parts would have the same length, which would allow us to form a square.

The program correctly returns the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that meet these conditions.

I have checked several examples and the program produces the expected output in all cases. I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
