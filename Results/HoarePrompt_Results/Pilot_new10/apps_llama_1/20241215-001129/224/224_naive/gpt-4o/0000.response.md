Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations $p$ such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. It seems to simply calculate the factorial of $n-1$, which is not the correct approach.

For example, when $n = 6$, the program outputs $120$, which is correct, but this is just a coincidence. For smaller values of $n$, the program may also produce correct results, but this does not guarantee that it will work for all $n$.

One potential case where the program may not work correctly is when $n$ is a prime number. In this case, the maximum value of $f(p)$ will be $2$, because the only divisors of $n$ are $1$ and $n$ itself. However, the program does not take this into account and simply calculates the factorial of $n-1$.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of $f(p)$ for a given $n$, and then count the number of permutations $p$ that achieve this maximum value. This is a more complex task than simply calculating the factorial of $n-1$, and it requires a deeper understanding of the properties of permutations and their greatest common divisors. 

For instance, when $n = 5$, we have a maximum value $f_{max}(5) = 3$. The permutations that achieve this maximum value are those that start with $1$, $2$, and $3$, or those that start with $1$, $3$, and $2$, in any order. There are $3! = 6$ such permutations for each starting sequence, and there are $2$ starting sequences, so the total number of permutations is $2 \cdot 6 = 12$. However, the program would output $24$, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
