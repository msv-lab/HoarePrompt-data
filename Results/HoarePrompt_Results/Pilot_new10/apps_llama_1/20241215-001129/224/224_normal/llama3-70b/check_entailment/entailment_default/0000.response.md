Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function `func_2` calculates the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, but it does not correctly calculate this value. The function `func_3` calculates the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `10^9 + 7`, but this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The problem requires counting the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. The code provided does not correctly implement this counting.

The function `func_2` seems to be calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of numbers from `1` to `n`, not the maximum value of `f(p)`. The function `func_3` is calculating the Fibonacci number, which is not related to the problem.

The code does not correctly handle the problem description, and the provided output hints do not agree with the code. The function `func_2` does not calculate the maximum value of `f(p)`, and the function `func_3` does not count the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`.

For example, when `n = 3`, the correct output should be `4`, which corresponds to the permutations `[2,1,3]`, `[2,3,1]`, `[3,1,2]`, and `[3,2,1]`. However, the provided code does not correctly calculate this output. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
