To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

The code is `dp[j] %= MOD`. 

Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is 0.

Since `dp[j]` is equal to `dp[f_max_n - 2]`, which is 0, `dp[j] %= MOD` will also result in 0, because any number modulo `MOD` will be itself if it is less than `MOD`, and since 0 is less than `MOD`, `dp[j]` will remain 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is `f_max_n - 2`**
