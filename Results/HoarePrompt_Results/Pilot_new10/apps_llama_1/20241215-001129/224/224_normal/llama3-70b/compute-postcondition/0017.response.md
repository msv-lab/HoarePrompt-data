To calculate the result, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the program. The code `dp[j] %= MOD` affects the value of `dp[j]`. Given that `MOD` is `1000000007` and `j` is `f_max_n`, we need to calculate `dp[f_max_n] %= 1000000007`. 

Since `dp[f_max_n]` is 2, which is less than `1000000007`, the result of `dp[f_max_n] %= 1000000007` is still 2. 

So, after executing the code, the value of `dp[f_max_n]` remains 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[f_max_n]` = 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
