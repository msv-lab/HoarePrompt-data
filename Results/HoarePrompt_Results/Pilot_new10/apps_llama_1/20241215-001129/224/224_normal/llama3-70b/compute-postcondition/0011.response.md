The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given the initial state, `j` is `f_max_n - 2` and `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 3]`. Since `dp[i]` is 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[f_max_n - 3]` is 0. 

So, `dp[j]` which is `dp[f_max_n - 2]` becomes `dp[f_max_n - 2] + 0` which is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`. But since `dp[f_max_n - 2]` was initially 0, the new value of `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is also 0 because 0 + 0 is 0. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and specifically `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is 0**
