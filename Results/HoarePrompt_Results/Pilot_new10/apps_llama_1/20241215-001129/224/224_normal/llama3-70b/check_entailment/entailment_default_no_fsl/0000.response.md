Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The main issue is that `func_2(n)` does not calculate `f_max(n)` correctly. The function `func_2(n)` is supposed to find the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, but it simply iterates from `1` to `n` and updates the maximum value by calculating the GCD of the current maximum and the current iteration number, starting with an initial maximum of `0`. This approach does not take into account the permutations of the numbers.

Furthermore, `func_3(n, f_max_n)` calculates the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is not related to the problem of counting the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`.

To solve the problem correctly, we would need to generate all permutations of the numbers from `1` to `n`, calculate `f(p)` for each permutation, and count the number of permutations where `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. The provided code does not implement this approach.

For example, when `n = 3`, the code outputs `4`, but it does not correctly calculate `f_max(3)` or count the permutations where `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(3)`. The correct output should be `4` because there are indeed `4` permutations where `f(p)` is equal to `2`, which is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of integers `1`, `2`, and `3`. However, the code does not arrive at this result through the correct calculation.

Therefore, the provided code does not solve the problem as described, and its correctness is **False**.
