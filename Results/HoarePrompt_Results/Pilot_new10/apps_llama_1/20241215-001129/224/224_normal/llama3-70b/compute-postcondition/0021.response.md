According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1 because the loop is iterating in reverse order. So, `j` becomes `f_max_n - 2`. 

State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` = 2, `dp[f_max_n]` = 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2**
