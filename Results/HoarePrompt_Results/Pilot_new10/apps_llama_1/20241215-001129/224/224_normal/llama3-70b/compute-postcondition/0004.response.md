According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, and `i` is 1, for the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `j` must be initialized to `f_max_n` before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
