Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

The function `func_2(n)` is supposed to calculate `f_max(n)`, which is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`. However, the current implementation simply calculates the GCD of all numbers from `1` to `n`, which is not related to the problem description.

The function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` is supposed to count the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. However, the current implementation simply calculates the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `1000000007`, which is not related to the problem description.

The problem description requires a more complex solution, involving the calculation of the GCD of prefixes of permutations and the counting of permutations with a specific property.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to generate all permutations of the numbers `1` to `n`, calculate `f(p)` for each permutation, and count the number of permutations where `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. This would require a different approach than the one implemented in the provided code. 

A correct implementation would involve the following steps:
1. Generate all permutations of the numbers `1` to `n`.
2. For each permutation, calculate the GCD of the prefix of length `i` for `i` from `1` to `n`.
3. Calculate `f(p)` as the number of distinct GCDs calculated in the previous step.
4. Calculate `f_max(n)` as the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations.
5. Count the number of permutations where `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`.

The provided code does not implement these steps, and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.
