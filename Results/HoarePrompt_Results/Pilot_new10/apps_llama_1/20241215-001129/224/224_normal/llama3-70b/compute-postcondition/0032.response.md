According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `f_max_n`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` is `f_max_n - 2`. The other variables `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i` do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 2` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`**
