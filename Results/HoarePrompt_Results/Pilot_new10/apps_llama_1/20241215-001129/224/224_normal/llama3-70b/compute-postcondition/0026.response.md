According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. 

For the loop to execute, `j` must start from `f_max_n` down to 1. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `j` is `f_max_n`. 

State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`**
