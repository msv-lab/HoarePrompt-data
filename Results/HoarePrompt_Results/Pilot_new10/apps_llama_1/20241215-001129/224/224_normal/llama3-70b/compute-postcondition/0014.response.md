According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` must have been equal to `n` because that's when the loop ends. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be equal to `n + 1` and since `i` starts from 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for `i` to reach `n + 1`. However, `n` must actually be greater than the previous value of `n` for `i` to be within the loop range again. Therefore, `i` should be 1 (because it starts from 1) and `n` must be greater than the previous `n`. 

State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `i` is 1**
