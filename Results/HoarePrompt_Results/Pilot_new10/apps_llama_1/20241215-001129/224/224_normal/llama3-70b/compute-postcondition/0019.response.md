The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, we substitute `j` with `f_max_n - 1` in the code. 

So, `dp[f_max_n - 1] += dp[f_max_n - 1 - 1]`, which simplifies to `dp[f_max_n - 1] += dp[f_max_n - 2]`. 

We know that `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`. Therefore, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` = 1 and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` = 1. 

After the update, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` = 2, `dp[f_max_n]` = 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` = 2, `dp[f_max_n]` = 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
