The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is `f_max_n`, this operation affects the last element of the `dp` list.

Initially, `dp[j]` equals 1 for all `j` from 0 to `f_max_n`. After the operation, `dp[f_max_n]` will be updated to `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`. Since `dp[f_max_n]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` are both 1, `dp[f_max_n]` becomes 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `n` is still greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is still `1000000007`, `i` is still 1, and `j` remains `f_max_n`. The `dp` list, however, has been modified at its last index.

Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[f_max_n]` = 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
