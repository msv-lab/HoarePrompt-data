The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive) and `mod` is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7. 

The function calculates the factorial of `n` starting from 2 (2 * 3 *... * n) and returns this value modulo `mod`. 

Upon examining the code line by line, it appears that the code accurately implements the described functionality within the given constraints. 

However, potential edge cases to consider include:
- What happens if `n` is less than 2 or greater than 10^6? The function does not include any error checking for these cases, so it will still attempt to calculate the factorial and return the result modulo `mod`.
- What happens if `mod` is not equal to 10^9 + 7? The function does not include any error checking for this case, so it will still attempt to calculate the factorial and return the result modulo the provided `mod` value.
- What happens if `n` is 0 or 1? Although the annotations specify that `n` is between 2 and 10^6, the code does not explicitly handle these cases, but since the loop starts from 2, the function will return 1 for `n` = 0 or 1.

Considering these potential edge cases, the functionality of the function is to calculate the factorial of `n` starting from 2 (or return 1 if `n` is 0 or 1) and return this value modulo `mod`, without any explicit error checking for the constraints on `n` and `mod`.

Functionality: ** The function calculates the factorial of `n` starting from 2 (or returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1) and returns this value modulo `mod`, for any integer `n` and `mod`, without explicit error checking for the constraints on `n` and `mod`. **
