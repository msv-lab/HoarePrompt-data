According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 3) is less than or equal to `n`. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again, but since `n` is already greater than or equal to 2, we can say `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, which is already satisfied by the condition 2 <= n <= 10^6. However, for `i` to be valid in the next iteration, `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 3**
