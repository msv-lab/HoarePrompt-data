To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states.

The loop code is as follows:
```python
for j in additional_marks:
    if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
        additional_marks.append(i + j)
```
From the loop code, we can see that `additional_marks` is a list that is being iterated over, and new elements are being appended to it if certain conditions are met.

The initial state of the variables is as follows:
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` and `y` are input integers
- The ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers
- `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer
- `i` is an element of `marks`
- `j` is equal to `n` (but this value is overwritten in the loop)
- If `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`

Now, let's analyze the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times:
- After 1 iteration, `j` is `x`, and if `i + x` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + x` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` contains `x`, `y`, and `i + x`.
- After 2 iterations, `j` is `y`, and if `i + y` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + y` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` contains at least `y` and `i + y`.
- After 3 iterations, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` also contains `i + j`.

From these output states, we can see that `additional_marks` is being dynamically updated based on the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`.

To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's consider what will happen when the loop terminates. The loop will terminate when there are no more elements to iterate over in `additional_marks`, or when the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks` are no longer met.

At this point, `additional_marks` will contain all the elements that were appended to it during the iterations, which are the values of `j` that satisfied the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`. The final value of `j` will be the last element that was iterated over in `additional_marks`.

The values of the other variables will remain unchanged, except for `additional_marks`, which will have been updated dynamically during the iterations.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is the last element that was iterated over in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` contains all the values of `j` that satisfied the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks` during the iterations.**
