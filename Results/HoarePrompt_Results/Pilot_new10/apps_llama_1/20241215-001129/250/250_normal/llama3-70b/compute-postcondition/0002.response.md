The code assigns `need_x` and `need_y` the values `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`**
