Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers. If `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` is a set with at least 3 elements including the new element `i + j`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
