To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement and the initial state.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(i, n):
```
Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be at least 3. This is because the `range()` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value. Therefore, if `n` equals `i` (which is 2 in this case), the loop would not execute because there would be no numbers in the range from `i` to `n`.

The initial state provides several variables: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, a sequence of integers representing a ruler, a set of unique integers `marks`, `i`, `need_x`, and `need_y`. However, the loop's execution depends directly on the values of `i` and `n`. Other variables might influence the loop body's execution or outcome but do not affect whether the loop starts or not.

Considering the loop's condition, we need to adjust the state so that `n` is at least 3 (since `i` is 2), ensuring the loop has at least one iteration. Additionally, since `j` starts at `i` (which is 2), `j` should initially be 2 for the loop to begin.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[1] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[1] == y`**
