Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` and `j` are equal to `n`. If `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`. If `need_y` is `True`, the state of `additional_marks` remains unchanged, but since there's no specific else part to modify it, the specifics of `additional_marks` when `need_y` is `True` are not further defined, except as initially given.***
