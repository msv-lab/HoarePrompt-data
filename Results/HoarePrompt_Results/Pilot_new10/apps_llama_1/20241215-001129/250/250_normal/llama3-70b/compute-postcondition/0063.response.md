The code appends the value of `x` to the list `additional_marks`. 

The list `additional_marks` was initially empty, so now it contains the single element `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is a boolean value indicating whether there exists a pair of marks in `marks` with a difference of `y`, `i` and `j` are equal to `n`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing the single element `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is a boolean value indicating whether there exists a pair of marks in `marks` with a difference of `y`, `i` and `j` are equal to `n`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing the single element `x`.**
