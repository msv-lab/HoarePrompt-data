According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If the set has at least one more element after the current `j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` has at least one element, and `j` is the smallest element in `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element after the current `j`, and `j` must be the next smallest element in `additional_marks`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `additional_marks` has at least two elements, `j` is the next smallest element in `additional_marks`**
