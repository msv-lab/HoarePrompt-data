Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, initially `j` is `x` and from then on the current value of `j` is `x`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and the current value of `i + j` is not an element of `marks`**
