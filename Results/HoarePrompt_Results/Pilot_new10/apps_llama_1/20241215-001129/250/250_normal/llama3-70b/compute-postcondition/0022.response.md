According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 1, `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == x`, `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`**
