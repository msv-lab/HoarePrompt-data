Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` has at least three elements where the last element is `i + j`. Otherwise, the state of `additional_marks` remains unchanged, with `j` being the next smallest element before any potential append operation.**
