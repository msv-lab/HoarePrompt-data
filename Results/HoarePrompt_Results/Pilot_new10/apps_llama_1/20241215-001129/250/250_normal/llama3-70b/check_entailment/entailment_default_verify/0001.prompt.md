You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue with the program is that it simply checks if the distances x and y can be measured with the existing marks. If not, it adds x and y as additional marks. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal solution. 

For example, if the input is:
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

The program will output 0, which is correct. However, if the input is:
4 250 185 235
0 20 185 250

The program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, with the additional mark being 235, because 235 - 20 = 215 and 215 is not in the existing marks, but 235 - 185 = 50 and 50 is not in the existing marks, but 235 - 20 = 215 is not in the existing marks, so we should add 235 as an additional mark.

Another example is if the input is:
3 300 180 270
0 180 270

The program will output 0, which is correct. However, if the input is:
4 300 180 270
0 90 180 270

The program will output 0, which is also correct.

However, the issue arises when the input is:
4 300 155 270
0 90 155 270

The program will output 2, with the additional marks being 155 and 270, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 0 because 270 - 155 = 115 and 115 is not in the existing marks, but 270 - 90 = 180 and 180 - 90 = 90 and there is no mark 115, but there is a mark 155, so we should be able to measure 155, and there is a mark 270, so we should be able to measure 270, but 270 - 155 = 115 is not in the existing marks, so we should be able to measure 115 by adding a mark 115, but we should be able to measure 155 and 270.

In this case, the program does not work correctly because it does not consider all possible cases. The correct approach would be to check all possible pairs of existing marks and see if we can measure the distances x and y by adding the minimum number of additional marks.

The correct program should consider all possible cases, including the cases where we need to add one or more marks to measure the distances x and y, and it should output the minimum number of additional marks needed.

The program should also consider the optimal solution, not just add x and y as additional marks. The optimal solution would be to find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure the distances x and y.

So, the given program is incorrect and does not solve the problem correctly. 

This solution does not work in all cases. 

One case where the solution does not work is if the input is:
4 250 185 235
0 20 185 250

In this case, the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 1, with the additional mark being 235.

The issue with the program is that it does not consider all possible cases. It simply checks if the distances x and y can be measured with the existing marks. If not, it adds x and y as additional marks. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal solution.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to consider all possible cases and find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure the distances x and y.

The correct program should use a different approach, such as checking all possible pairs of existing marks and seeing if we can measure the distances x and y by adding the minimum number of additional marks.

Here is the correct Python code for this problem:

```python
def min_additional_marks():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))

    need_x = any(marks[j] - marks[i] == x for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n))
    need_y = any(marks[j] - marks[i] == y for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n))

    additional_marks = set()
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.add(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.add(y)

    for mark in marks:
        if mark + x <= l and mark + x not in marks and x not in additional_marks:
            additional_marks.add(mark + x)
        if mark + y <= l and mark + y not in marks and y not in additional_marks:
            additional_marks.add(mark + y)

    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(additional_marks))))

min_additional_marks()
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: To understand the functionality of the given function, we need to analyze the provided annotated code and consider the actual code as the truth, including any potential edge cases and missing logic. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
