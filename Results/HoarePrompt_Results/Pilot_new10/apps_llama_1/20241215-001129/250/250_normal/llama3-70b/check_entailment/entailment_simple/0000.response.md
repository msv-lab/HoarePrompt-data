Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The main issue lies in the way the program checks for the existence of marks that can measure distances x and y, and how it determines the minimum number of additional marks needed.

According to the problem description, Valery can add marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler. The program attempts to add marks x and y if they are not already measurable. However, it does not consider the fact that adding a mark at a distance that is a multiple of x or y could potentially allow for the measurement of both distances with fewer additional marks.

For example, consider a case where x = 10, y = 20, and the existing marks are 0 and 30. The program would add marks 10 and 20, resulting in two additional marks. However, adding a single mark at 10 would allow for the measurement of both distances 10 and 20, since 20 can be measured as 30 - 10.

Furthermore, the program's approach of adding sums of existing marks and additional marks can lead to unnecessary marks being added, which can exceed the minimum number required.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of additional marks and determining the minimum number required to measure both distances x and y. This can be achieved through a more sophisticated algorithm that considers the relationships between the existing marks and the distances to be measured.

In conclusion, the program does not always follow the problem description, and its approach can lead to suboptimal solutions. Therefore, its correctness is **False**.
