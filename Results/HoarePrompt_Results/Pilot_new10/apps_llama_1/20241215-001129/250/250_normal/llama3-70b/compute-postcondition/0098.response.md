The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. 

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `i` is an input integer, but for the sake of calculation let's denote it by its value or keep `i` as it is.

The value of `j` is the next smallest element in `additional_marks`, so `j` is an input integer.

After appending `i + j` to `additional_marks`, the list `additional_marks` now has at least two elements: its original elements and the new element `i + j`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `additional_marks` has at least two elements including `i + j` where `i` is an input integer and `j` is the next smallest element in the original `additional_marks`, `j` is an input integer**
