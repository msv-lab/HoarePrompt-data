Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, then the current value of `need_x` is `True` and `need_y` is `False`. The current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `y`.**
