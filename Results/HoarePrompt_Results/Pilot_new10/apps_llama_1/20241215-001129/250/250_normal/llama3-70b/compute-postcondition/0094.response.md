Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set, and `j` is the smallest element in `additional_marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and the current value of `i + j` is not an element in `marks`.**
