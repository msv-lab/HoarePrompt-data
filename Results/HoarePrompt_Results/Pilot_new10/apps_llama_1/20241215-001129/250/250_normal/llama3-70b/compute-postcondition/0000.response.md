The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are updated based on the input. Since the input is a string of four space-separated integers, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values of these four integers, respectively. 

The fact that `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, is no longer guaranteed as the new values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are determined by the input. 

The ruler is still represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, where `a_{i}` denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin. However, the condition `a_1 = 0` and `a_{n} = l` may not hold anymore.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, where `a_{i}` denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin**
