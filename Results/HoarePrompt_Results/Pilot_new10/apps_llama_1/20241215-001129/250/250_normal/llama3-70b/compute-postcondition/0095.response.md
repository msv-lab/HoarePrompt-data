The code appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` set. 

The previous value of `additional_marks` was a non-empty set, and now it includes the additional element `i + j`. 
The value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not an element in `marks`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set that includes `i + j`, and `j` is the smallest element in `additional_marks` which may have changed after the append operation.**
