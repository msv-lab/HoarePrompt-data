According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 2`. Also, `n` must be greater than `i + 2` for the loop to execute again. The values of `x`, `y`, `l`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y` do not affect the loop condition, so they remain the same. 

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is the previous `i`, `j` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True`. Additionally, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True`.**
