The code sets `need_x` to `True`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this code. 
`n` is still an input integer and must be greater than 1, 
`l` is still an input integer, 
`x` is still an input integer, 
`y` is still an input integer, 
the ruler is still represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, 
`marks` is still a set of unique input integers, 
`i` is still 1, 
`j` is still 1, 
`need_y` is still `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`, 
and the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is still equal to `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`, and the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`.**
