According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `need_y` is True or False depending on the previous condition**
