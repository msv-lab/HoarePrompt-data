Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 3, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True`, otherwise `need_y` remains unchanged, and if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True`, but this condition is not checked in this if statement, so `need_x` remains unchanged***
