According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `marks`. If `marks` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` being an element of `marks`. The state of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, the ruler, `j`, and `need_y` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but their initial states should still be considered. `additional_marks` is dependent on `need_y`, but its state does not affect the loop's execution directly. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is equal to `n`, if `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`**
