The code provided is a print statement that outputs the elements of `additional_marks` as a string, separated by spaces. This operation does not modify any variables; it only outputs the current state of `additional_marks`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` and `y` are the original input integers
- The ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers
- `marks` is a set of unique input integers
- `additional_marks` contains all sums `i + j` where `i` is in `marks`, `j` is in the updated `additional_marks`, `i + j <= l`, and `i + j` is not in `marks`
- `i` is the last element in `marks`
- `j` is the last element in the updated `additional_marks`
- The length of `additional_marks` is returned at the output state

The print statement does not change any of these conditions but indicates that the contents of `additional_marks` are being output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are the original input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `additional_marks` contains all sums `i + j` where `i` is in `marks`, `j` is in the updated `additional_marks`, `i + j <= l`, and `i + j` is not in `marks`, `i` is the last element in `marks`, `j` is the last element in the updated `additional_marks`, and the string representation of `additional_marks` has been printed. The length of `additional_marks` has been returned.**
