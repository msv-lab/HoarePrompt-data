Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is `y`, and if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` contains at least `y` and `i + y`, otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `additional_marks` containing at least `y` and potentially `i + x` if the original conditions were met.**
