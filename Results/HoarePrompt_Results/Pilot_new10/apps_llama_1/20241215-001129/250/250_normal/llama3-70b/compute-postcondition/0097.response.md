According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If `additional_marks` is not empty after the last iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set that includes `i + j`, and `j` is the smallest element in `additional_marks`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least two elements, and `j` must be the second smallest element in `additional_marks` after the smallest one has been processed. Since `j` was the smallest in the previous iteration, for `j` to be the next smallest, the smallest element from the previous iteration must have been removed or `additional_marks` has more than one element with the same smallest value and one of them has been removed. Therefore, for `additional_marks` to have the next smallest `j`, one of its elements with the smallest value must have been removed.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `additional_marks` has at least one element, `j` is the next smallest element in `additional_marks`**
