Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `mark` is either the last mark processed or remains undefined if `marks` is empty, if `new_marks` is not empty, then the integer 1 has been printed, the value of `new_marks.pop()` has been printed, and `new_marks` is a set containing one less element than before. If `new_marks` is empty, then `result` has been printed as a string of its elements separated by spaces, and the length of `result` is printed as output. Additionally, `x_found` is `True` if the condition for `x` was met, and `y_found` is `True` if the condition for `y` was met.**
