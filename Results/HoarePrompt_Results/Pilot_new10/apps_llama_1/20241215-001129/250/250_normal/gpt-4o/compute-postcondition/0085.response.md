The value of `result` is updated by appending the input integer `y` to it. Initially, if `x_found` is `False`, then `result` is a list containing the input integer `x`. After appending `y`, `result` will be a list containing `x` and `y` if `x_found` is `False`. If `x_found` is `True`, then `result` retains its original value but with `y` appended to it. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `mark` is either the last mark processed or remains undefined if `marks` is empty, `new_marks` is an empty set, `y_found` is `False`, if `x_found` is `False`, then `result` is a list containing the input integers `x` and `y`, otherwise `result` is its original value with `y` appended to it, and `x_found` retains its original value**
