The code `print(1)` simply prints the integer 1 to the console. This operation does not modify any variables or data structures in the program. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `mark` is either the last mark processed or remains undefined if `marks` is empty, `new_marks` is a non-empty set containing elements added based on the conditions checked during the loop iterations, `x_found` is `True` if the condition for `x` was met, `y_found` is `True` if the condition for `y` was met, the integer 1 has been printed, and the current value of `new_marks` is not empty, indicating that at least one new mark has been added.
