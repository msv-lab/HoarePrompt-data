The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value of `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. 

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 
`n` is an input integer, 
`l` is an input integer, 
`x` is an input integer, 
`y` is an input integer, 
`a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, 
`marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, 
`marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, 
`y_found` is either `True` or `False`, 
`mark` is the third mark in `marks`, 
`new_marks` is a set containing at least the element `mark + y`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`, `new_marks` is a set containing at least the element `mark + y`**
