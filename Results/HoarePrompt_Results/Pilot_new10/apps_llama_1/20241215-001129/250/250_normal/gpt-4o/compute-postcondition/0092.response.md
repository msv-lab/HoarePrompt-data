The function accepts several parameters through input: two integers `n` and `l`, and two integers `x` and `y` where `x < y`. It also accepts a list of `n` integers representing marks on a ruler from 0 to `l`. 

The function checks if there exist marks on the ruler such that the difference between two marks is either `x` or `y`. If both conditions are met, it prints 0.

If either `x` or `y` (or both) is not found, it attempts to find a mark such that adding or subtracting `x` or `y` results in another mark on the ruler, given certain conditions. If such a mark is found, it prints 1 followed by the mark.

If no such mark is found for either `x` or `y`, it prints the number of missing distances (`x` and/or `y`) and then prints the actual values of the missing distances.

The function does not return any value but prints the results directly to the console.

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `n` integers representing marks on a ruler, checks for marks with differences of `x` or `y`, and prints 0 if both are found; otherwise, it attempts to find a mark that can be added or subtracted by `x` or `y` to get another mark, and if such a mark is found, it prints 1 followed by the mark, or it prints the number of missing distances and their values if no such mark is found. **
