The value of `new_marks` is updated by adding the element `mark - y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `mark` is still the third mark in `marks`. The value of `n` is still an input integer, `l` is still an input integer, `x` is still an input integer, `y` is still an input integer, `a` is still a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is still a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` is still a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`, `new_marks` contains at least the elements it had before and `mark - y`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`, `new_marks` contains at least the elements it had before and `marks[2] - y`.**
