Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` from the first line, and the list of marks `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` from the second line.

2. **Initial Checks**: The program checks if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks on the ruler. It does this by iterating through each mark and checking if the mark plus or minus `x` or `y` is present in the set of marks. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, the program prints `0`, indicating no new marks are needed.

3. **Finding New Marks**: If either `x` or `y` cannot be measured, the program attempts to find a new mark that can be added to the ruler to measure both distances. It does this by checking if the sum or difference of `x` and `y` with any existing mark is also present in the set of marks. If such a mark is found, it is added to the `new_marks` set.

4. **Printing New Marks**: If a new mark is found, the program prints `1` followed by the new mark. If no new mark is found, the program checks if both `x` and `y` need to be added as new marks. If so, it prints the length of the `result` list (which contains `x` and `y`) followed by the list of new marks.

The program covers all possible cases:

* If both `x` and `y` can be measured using existing marks, it prints `0`.
* If either `x` or `y` can be measured by adding a new mark, it prints `1` followed by the new mark.
* If both `x` and `y` need to be added as new marks, it prints the length of the `result` list followed by the list of new marks.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
