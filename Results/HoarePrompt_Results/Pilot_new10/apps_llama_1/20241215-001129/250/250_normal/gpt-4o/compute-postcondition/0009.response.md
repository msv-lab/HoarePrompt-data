Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, if previously `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then the current value of `x_found` is `True` and `y_found` is `False`, otherwise, the current state of `x_found` and `y_found` remains unchanged, `mark` is the first mark in the `marks` list, and the current value of either `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`**
