#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `n` integers representing marks on a ruler, checks for marks with differences of `x` or `y`, and prints 0 if both are found; otherwise, it attempts to find a mark that can be added or subtracted by `x` or `y` to get another mark, and if such a mark is found, it prints 1 followed by the mark, or it prints the number of missing distances and their values if no such mark is found.
