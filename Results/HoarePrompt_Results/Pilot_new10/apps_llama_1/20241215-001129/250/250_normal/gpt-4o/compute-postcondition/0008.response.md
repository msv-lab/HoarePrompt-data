Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, if `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True` and `y_found` is `False`, otherwise, the state of `x_found` and `y_found` remains unchanged, and `mark` is the first mark in the `marks` list***
