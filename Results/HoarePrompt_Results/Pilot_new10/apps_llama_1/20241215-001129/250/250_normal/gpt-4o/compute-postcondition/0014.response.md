Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the `marks` list. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `x_found` and `y_found` retaining their original values.**
