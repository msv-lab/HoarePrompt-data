Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the problem correctly because it assumes that the initial number of stones is 0. However, the problem statement does not guarantee this and allows for the initial number of stones to be any positive integer that would allow all the given operations to be performed without the pile being empty at any point.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
---
```
The program would output `0`, which is correct. However, if the input is:
```
2
-+
```
The program still starts with `stones = 0`, which means it will not be able to perform the first operation (`-`) because `stones` would be less than 0 after the operation, which contradicts the fact that the pile must be non-empty before each operation of taking one stone. 

In this case, the correct output should be `1`, but the program's logic does not correctly handle this situation. It needs to consider the minimum number of stones required to start with so that all operations can be performed, not just the operations starting from 0 stones. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program to find the minimum initial number of stones that would allow all operations to be performed without the pile being empty at any point. One possible approach would be to find the maximum number of consecutive `-` operations in the input string, as this would require the most stones to be present initially. We can then start with this number of stones and perform the operations to find the minimum final number of stones. 

Here is a corrected version of the program in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = 0
    max_minus = 0
    current_minus = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '-':
            current_minus += 1
            max_minus = max(max_minus, current_minus)
        elif operation == '+':
            current_minus = max(0, current_minus - 1)
    stones = max_minus
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones -= 1
    print(stones)

func()
```
