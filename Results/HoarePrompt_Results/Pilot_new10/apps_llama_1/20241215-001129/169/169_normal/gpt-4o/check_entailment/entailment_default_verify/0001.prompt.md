You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output

Input

++++

Output

-+

Output

Input
5
++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    stones = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones = max(0, stones - 1)
    print(stones)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the problem correctly because it assumes that the initial number of stones is 0. However, the problem statement does not guarantee this and allows for the initial number of stones to be any positive integer that would allow all the given operations to be performed without the pile being empty at any point.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
---
```
The program would output `0`, which is correct. However, if the input is:
```
2
-+
```
The program still starts with `stones = 0`, which means it will not be able to perform the first operation (`-`) because `stones` would be less than 0 after the operation, which contradicts the fact that the pile must be non-empty before each operation of taking one stone. 

In this case, the correct output should be `1`, but the program's logic does not correctly handle this situation. It needs to consider the minimum number of stones required to start with so that all operations can be performed, not just the operations starting from 0 stones. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program to find the minimum initial number of stones that would allow all operations to be performed without the pile being empty at any point. One possible approach would be to find the maximum number of consecutive `-` operations in the input string, as this would require the most stones to be present initially. We can then start with this number of stones and perform the operations to find the minimum final number of stones. 

Here is a corrected version of the program in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = 0
    max_minus = 0
    current_minus = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '-':
            current_minus += 1
            max_minus = max(max_minus, current_minus)
        elif operation == '+':
            current_minus = max(0, current_minus - 1)
    stones = max_minus
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones -= 1
    print(stones)

func()
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` from the user, consisting of only '+' and '-' characters, and prints the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations in `s`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
