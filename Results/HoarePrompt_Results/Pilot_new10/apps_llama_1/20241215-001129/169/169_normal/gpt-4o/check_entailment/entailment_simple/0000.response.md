Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations. However, the program calculates the maximum possible number of stones, assuming that every '+' operation adds a stone and every '-' operation removes a stone, but never goes below 0.

The problem description allows for the starting number of stones to be any positive integer, and the goal is to find the minimum number of stones that can be in the pile after the operations. The program does not consider this and simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations.

For example, if the input is "++-", the program will output 1, which is correct because if we start with 0 stones, the final number of stones will be 1. However, if the input is "---", the program will output 0, which is correct, but it's not the minimum possible number of stones, because the problem description states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. In this case, the minimum possible number of stones is 3, because we need to start with at least 3 stones to remove 3 stones.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible starting numbers of stones and find the minimum number of stones that can be in the pile after the operations. The program should calculate the minimum possible number of stones by simulating the operations for all possible starting numbers of stones and finding the minimum result. 

Here is a correct Python solution for the problem:

```python
def min_stones_after_operations():
    n = int(input())
    operations = input()
    min_stones = float('inf')

    for start_stones in range(1, n + 1):
        stones = start_stones
        for operation in operations:
            if operation == '+':
                stones += 1
            elif operation == '-':
                stones -= 1
        min_stones = min(min_stones, stones)

    print(min_stones)
```

This solution iterates over all possible starting numbers of stones and simulates the operations. It keeps track of the minimum number of stones seen so far and prints it as the result. This ensures that the solution meets the requirements of the problem description.
