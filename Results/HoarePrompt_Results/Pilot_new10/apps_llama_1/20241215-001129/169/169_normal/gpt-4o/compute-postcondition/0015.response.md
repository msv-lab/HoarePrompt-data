Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters. If the second character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is either 1 or 2. If the second character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0. For any other second character in `s`, the state of `stones` and other variables remains unchanged.**
