According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, and the second character of `s` determines the state of `stones`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If the third character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is either 1 or 2. If the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0. For any other third character in `s`, the state of `stones` and other variables remains unchanged.**
