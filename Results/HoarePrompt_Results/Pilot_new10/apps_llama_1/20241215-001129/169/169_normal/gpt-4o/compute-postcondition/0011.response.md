To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

The for loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` must have had at least 1 character, and the first character of `s` determined the initial values of `stones` and `operation`.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 characters, because the loop needs to move on to the next character in the string. 

If the first character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 1 and `operation` is '+'. When the loop executes again, it will move to the next character in the string, so `operation` will be the second character in `s`.

If the first character of `s` is not '+', then `stones` is 0 and `operation` is the first character in `s`. When the loop executes again, it will move to the next character in the string, so `operation` will be the second character in `s`.

In either case, `n` remains unchanged as it is not related to the loop iteration, and `s` must have at least 2 characters for the loop to execute again. The value of `stones` is not directly affected by the loop iteration, as its value is determined by the first character of `s`, which is already processed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stones` is either 0 or 1 based on the first character of `s`, `operation` is the second character in the string `s`.**
