To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the given code snippet affects them.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100.
- `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters.
- If the third character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is either 1 or 2.
- If the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0.
- For any other third character in `s`, the state of `stones` and other variables remains unchanged.

The given code snippet is `stones += 1`. This means we are incrementing the value of `stones` by 1.

Considering the conditions for `stones` based on the third character of `s`:

1. If the third character of `s` is '+', then initially `stones` is either 1 or 2. After incrementing by 1, `stones` will be either 2 or 3.
2. If the third character of `s` is '-', then initially `stones` is 0. After incrementing by 1, `stones` will be 1.
3. For any other third character in `s`, the initial state of `stones` is unchanged, but since we are incrementing `stones` by 1, its value will increase by 1 from its previous state, whatever that may be.

The state of `n` and the general properties of `s` (being a string with at least 3 characters) are not affected by the code snippet. Only the value of `stones` is updated based on its initial value and the condition related to the third character of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If the third character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is either 2 or 3. If the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 1. For any other third character in `s`, the value of `stones` is incremented by 1 from its previous state.**
