The function `func` accepts two parameters, an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of only '+' and '-' characters, where `n` is in the range 1 <= `n` <= 100. It then iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is '+', it increments a counter `stones` by 1. If the character is '-', it decrements the counter `stones` by 1, but not below 0. After processing all characters in the string, the function prints the final value of `stones`, which represents the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations in `s`. 

However, there's a discrepancy between the annotated code and the actual code. The annotated code mentions that the function accepts two parameters `n` and `s`, but the actual code does not define the function with these parameters. Instead, it reads `n` and `s` from the user input inside the function. 

Considering the actual code, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` from the user, consisting of only '+' and '-' characters, and prints the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations in `s`. **
