Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 1 and `operation` is '+'. If the first character of `s` is not '+', then `stones` is 0 and `operation` is the first character in the string `s`.***
