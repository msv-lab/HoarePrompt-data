The input to the function will be a positive integer and a string s of length n consisting of only '+' and '-' characters. However, the given code only includes `n = int(input())`, which means we're only considering the input of a positive integer `n`. 

The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial constraint that `n` is in the range 1 <= n <= 100 is still applicable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, input by the user**
