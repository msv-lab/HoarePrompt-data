The code prints the difference between `plus_count` and `minus_count`. The value of `n` is not affected, the value of `s` is not affected, `minus_count` is not changed, and `plus_count` is not changed. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The expression `plus_count - minus_count` is evaluated and printed. Since `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`, the result of the expression is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is the number of '+' characters in `s`, `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`, and the value `plus_count - minus_count` has been printed**
