To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is the input string
- `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`
- `plus_count` is the number of '+' characters in `s`
- The current value of `minus_count` is higher than the current value of `plus_count`

The code is:
```
print(0)
```
This code simply prints the value 0 to the console. It does not modify any variables.

Given this, the output state will remain the same as the initial state because the `print(0)` statement does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `minus_count`, or `plus_count`. However, it's worth noting that the value 0 has been printed to the console, which is an action rather than a change to the state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is the number of '+' characters in `s`, `minus_count` is higher than `plus_count`, and the value 0 has been returned to the console.**
