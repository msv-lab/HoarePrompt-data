The code `plus_count = s.count('+')` introduces a new variable `plus_count` and assigns it the value of the number of '+' characters in the string `s`. 

`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, and `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`. The states of `n`, `s`, and `minus_count` are not affected.

`plus_count` is assigned the value of `s.count('+')`, which counts the number of '+' characters in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is the number of '+' characters in `s`.**
