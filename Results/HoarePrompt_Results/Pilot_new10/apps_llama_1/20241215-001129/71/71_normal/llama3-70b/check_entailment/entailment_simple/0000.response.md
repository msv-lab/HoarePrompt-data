Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

The problem statement asks to find the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number `n`, so that the result is divisible by 10^k. However, the provided program simply removes the least significant digits until it finds a number that is divisible by 10^k, which is not necessarily the minimum number of digits to be deleted.

Here's an example that demonstrates the program's incorrectness:

Input: `10203049 2`

The program will output `7`, because it will keep removing the least significant digits until it reaches `10`, which is divisible by 10^2. However, the correct answer is `3`, because we can remove the digits `2`, `3`, and `4` to get `100049`, and then remove the `0`s to get `10`, but we can also get the number `0` which is divisible by 10^2, by removing the digits `1`, `0`, `2`, `3` which is still not the minimum number of digits to delete. But, if we notice we can delete the `1`, `0`, `2` from `10203049` to get `3049`, and the number `49` is not divisible by 10^2 and in order for `49` to be divisible by 10^2 we need to delete 2 more digits which sums up to `3` so we can delete the `1`, `0`, `2` from `10203049` to get `3049`, and then we can remove `3`, and `4` to get `9`, and then we need to delete the last `9` from `9` in order to get a number which is divisible by 10^2 which sums up to a total of `4` but in the case where we remove `1`, `0`, `2` from `10203049` to get `3049`, we can get a minimum of `3` by removing the `4` from `3049` to get `309` then we can get `3` by deleting the `3` from `309` and `0` to get `9` which is still not divisible by 10^2 and we can delete the last `9` from `9` to get `0` (in this last case we can get a total of `4` deleted digits) and there is also the case where we remove the `1` and `0` from `10203049` to get `203049` then we can remove the `2` from `203049` to get `3049`, then we remove the `4` and `3` and `0` and `9` which sums up to `5` and the same would happen if we remove only the `1` from `10203049` and so on but as we can see in this specific case we can get `3` by first removing the `1` then the `0` and then the `2` to get `3049` and then removing the `4`. So we can clearly see from all these different cases that the answer is `3` which is not the answer the program provides, so this demonstrates that the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to implement a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming, to find the minimum number of digits to be deleted. 

This is just an example and there are many other possible cases where the program does not meet the problem description, the key is that it should delete the least number of digits, and this can't be achieved by simply dividing the input number `n` by `10`.
