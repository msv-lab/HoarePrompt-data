The code performs integer division of `n` by 10. Given that `n` is the input integer divided by 100 and not divisible by 10, the new value of `n` is the input integer divided by 1000 and still not divisible by 10, because dividing by 10 does not change the divisibility by 10.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer divided by 1000 and not divisible by 10, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 1000 and not divisible by 10, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 3**
