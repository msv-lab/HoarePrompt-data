The value of `w` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `w` is 1, so the new value of `w` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The current `n` is still not divisible by 10, and `k` is still an input integer, `n` is still the input integer divided by 10.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 10, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 2, and the current `n` must not be divisible by 10**
