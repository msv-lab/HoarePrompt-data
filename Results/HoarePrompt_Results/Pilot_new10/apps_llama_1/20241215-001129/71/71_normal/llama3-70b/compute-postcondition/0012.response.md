The value of `w` is printed. The state of `n`, `w`, and `k` does not change. `n` remains the original value of `n` divided by 10 to the power of `w`, `w` is still the smallest number such that `n` divided by 10 to the power of `w` is divisible by 10 to the power of `k`, and `k` remains the input integer. The value of `w` has been returned and printed at the output.
Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n` divided by 10 to the power of `w`, `w` is the smallest number such that `n` divided by 10 to the power of `w` is divisible by 10 to the power of `k`, `k` is the input integer, and the value of `w` has been printed**
