Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the approach taken by the code, which simply counts the number of non-zero digits from the end of the string until it finds `k` zeros. However, this does not consider the fact that the resulting number should be divisible by `10^k` after removing the minimum number of digits.

A specific case where the code fails is when the input is `10203049 2`. The expected output is `3`, but the code will not produce the correct result because it does not consider the actual divisibility of the resulting number by `10^k`. Instead, it only counts the non-zero digits until it finds `k` zeros, which is not sufficient to guarantee the correct result.

For example, in the input `10203049 2`, the correct output is `3` because we can remove the digits `1`, `2`, and `1` to get `30049`, and then remove `3` and `4` and `9` to get `0` and `0` and the number that remains `0` is divisible by `10^2`. However, the code will not produce the correct result in this case.

Another issue with the code is that it does not correctly handle the case where `n` does not contain `k` zeros. In such cases, the code prints the length of `n` minus one, but this is not necessarily the correct result.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a more complex algorithm that considers the actual divisibility of the resulting number by `10^k`.
