The value of `to_remove` is printed, but the values of the variables do not change. The print statement only outputs the value of `to_remove` but does not modify it or any other variables. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the original numeric string input, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, and `to_remove` is the count of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed, and `to_remove` has been returned at the output.
