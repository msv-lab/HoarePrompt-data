It appears there is a discrepancy in the information provided. The function definition is given as `def func():`, which indicates that the function does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention two parameters, `n` and `k`, with specific constraints on their values.

Assuming the function actually accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, based on the provided constraints, we can proceed as follows:

The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9.

However, since the output description is missing, we cannot determine the return value of the function. To complete the task, we need the output description to understand what the function returns based on the input parameters `n` and `k`.

Given the missing information, we cannot accurately describe the functionality of the function. If the output description were provided, we could determine the return value based on the input parameters and describe the functionality accordingly.

For the sake of providing a formatted answer based on the information given and assuming we would have the output details, the answer would be structured as follows, but it cannot be accurately completed without the output description:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, where n is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, and k is a positive integer between 1 and 9, and returns [insert return description based on n and k].**
