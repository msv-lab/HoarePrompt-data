The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a numeric string that must have at least one more digit after removing the last digit, `k` is an integer. If the new last digit of `n` (which is the second last digit of the original `n`) is '0', then `count_zeros` is updated to be one more than the previous value and `to_remove` is updated accordingly. If the new last digit of `n` is not '0', then `count_zeros` is updated to be one more than the previous value and `to_remove` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is a numeric string that must have at least one more digit after removing the last digit, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is incremented by 1, if the new last digit of `n` is '0' then `count_zeros` = previous `count_zeros` + 1 and `to_remove` is updated accordingly, if the new last digit of `n` is not '0' then `count_zeros` = previous `count_zeros` + 1 and `to_remove` is updated accordingly**
