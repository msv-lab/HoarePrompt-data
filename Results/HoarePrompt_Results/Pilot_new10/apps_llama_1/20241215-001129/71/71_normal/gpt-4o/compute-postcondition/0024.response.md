Postcondition: **`n` is a numeric string that must have at least one more digit after removing the last digit, `k` is an integer. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then if the last digit of `n` is '0', `count_zeros` is incremented by 1 and `to_remove` is updated accordingly based on whether the new last digit of `n` is '0' or not. If the last digit of `n` is not '0', then `to_remove` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, then the conditions regarding `count_zeros`, `to_remove`, and their relations to the digits of `n` remain unchanged as this case does not trigger any updates or breaks.**
