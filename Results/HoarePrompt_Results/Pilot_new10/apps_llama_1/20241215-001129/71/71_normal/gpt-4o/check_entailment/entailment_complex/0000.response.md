Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number `n`, so that the result is divisible by `10^k`. However, the program only checks for the presence of `k` zeros from the end of the number and counts the non-zero digits until it finds `k` zeros. If `k` zeros are not found, it prints the length of `n` minus one.

The program does not consider all possible cases. For example, if `n` is a number that does not contain `k` zeros, but can be made divisible by `10^k` by removing some digits from the beginning or middle of the number, the program will not find the correct solution. 

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the result can start with a zero only if the result is zero and written by exactly one digit.

To correctly solve this problem, a more complex approach would be needed, such as using dynamic programming or checking all possible substrings of the number to find the minimum number of digits that need to be removed to make it divisible by `10^k`. 

For instance, for the input `10203049` and `k = 2`, the program will print `8` (length of `n` minus one), but the correct answer is `3` because we can remove the digits `1`, `2`, and `4` to get `0300`, which is divisible by `10^2`. 

This shows that the program does not always follow the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
