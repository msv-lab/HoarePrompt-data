Postcondition: ***`n` is the original numeric string input, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed, and `to_remove` is the count of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then `to_remove` has been returned at the output. Otherwise, the value `len(n) - 1` has been printed and the count of zeros from the end of `n` is less than `k`.***
