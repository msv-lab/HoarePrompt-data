Postcondition: **`n` is a non-empty numeric string, `k` is an integer, if the last digit of `n` is '0', then the current value of `count_zeros` is 1 and the current value of `to_remove` is 0. Otherwise, the current value of `count_zeros` is 0, the current value of `to_remove` is 1, and the last digit of `n` is not '0'. The current value of `count_zeros` equals the value of `k`.**
