Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case. 

For example, if we take the input "100 9", the expected output is 2, but the code will print 2 which is correct, however, if the input is "12 1", the expected output is 1 because we can remove the digit '1' to get '2' which is not divisible by 10 but the code is checking for the zeros from the end which will not give the correct result. It will print 1 which is correct but it's just a coincidence because the problem description asks to find the minimum number of digits that should be removed so that the resulting number is divisible by 10^k. In this case, the number should be '0' and we need to remove one digit to get '0' from '12'.

Another example, the input "10203049 2" will also not give the correct result, the expected output is 3 but the code is checking for zeros from the end and it will not give the correct result.

The problem description requires the program to check all possible digits that can be removed to make the resulting number divisible by 10^k, not just the zeros from the end. Therefore, the code does not work as expected for all potential cases and is incorrect.
