Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply removes the last digit of the number `n` in each iteration until `n` is divisible by `10 ** k`, which is not the optimal solution.

For example, consider the input `10203049 2`. The correct solution would be to remove the digits `1`, `2`, and `3`, resulting in the number `040`, but since the result should not start with unnecessary leading zeros, we would remove `4` and one `0` as well, resulting in `0`, which requires removing 3 digits from the original number `10203049` to get a number divisible by `10 ** 2 = 100`. However, the provided program would remove the last digits one by one, which would result in removing more digits than necessary.

A more correct approach would be to convert the number to a string and then try all possible substrings to see which one, when removed, results in a number that is divisible by `10 ** k` and requires the minimum number of digits to be removed.

Here is a possible correct solution:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = str(n)
    min_removed = float('inf')
    for mask in range(1 << len(s)):
        new_s = ''
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if (mask >> i) & 1:
                new_s += s[i]
        if new_s and (new_s[0]!= '0' or new_s == '0'):
            num = int(new_s)
            if num % (10 ** k) == 0:
                min_removed = min(min_removed, len(s) - len(new_s))
    print(min_removed)
```
