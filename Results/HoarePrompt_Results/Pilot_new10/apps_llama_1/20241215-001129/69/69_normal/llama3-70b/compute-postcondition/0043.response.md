The code snippet `res = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `res`. This does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is 0**
