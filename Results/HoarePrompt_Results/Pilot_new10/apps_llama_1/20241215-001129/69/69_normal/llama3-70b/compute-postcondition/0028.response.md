Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers. If `op` is 'U', then `y` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', then `y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1.**
