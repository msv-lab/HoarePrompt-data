Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers. If `op` is 'D', then `y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'U', the postcondition is not explicitly defined in the given parts, but based on the provided structure, it seems that 'U' would not change the values of `x` and `y` as no specific action is described for 'U' in the given else part.**
