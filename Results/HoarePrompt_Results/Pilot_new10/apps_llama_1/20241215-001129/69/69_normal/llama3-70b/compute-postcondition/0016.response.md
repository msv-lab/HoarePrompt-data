Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers. Since the first character `op` in `ops` is 'L', `ux` is -1 and `uy` is 0, `lx` and `ly` remain 0.***
