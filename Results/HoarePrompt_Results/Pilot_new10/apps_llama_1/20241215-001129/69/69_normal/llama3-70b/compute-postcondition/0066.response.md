The code increments `dx` by 1. However, the initial state does not mention `dx`. Since `dx` is not defined in the initial state, we can infer that `dx` is initially 0 because it's being incremented. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `uy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is 1**
