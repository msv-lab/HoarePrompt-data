The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `uy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `dx + 1`.
