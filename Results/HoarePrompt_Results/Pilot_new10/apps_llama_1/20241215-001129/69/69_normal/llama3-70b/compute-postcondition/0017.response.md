Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the first character `op` in `ops` is 'R', then `ux` is 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0. If the first character `op` in `ops` is 'L', then `ux` is -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0.**
