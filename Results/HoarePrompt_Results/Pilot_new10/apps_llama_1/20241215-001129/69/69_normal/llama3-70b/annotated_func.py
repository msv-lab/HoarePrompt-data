    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`. If `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns the total number of operations that do not meet the conditions for updating `dy` or `dx`, denoted as `res`. If `n` is 0, then `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, including the number of operations `n`, a string of `n` operations where each operation is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net movement in the x and y directions based on the operations and checks if the destination (`x`, `y`) is reachable. If the destination is not reachable, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the number of operations that cannot be performed without overshooting the destination. The function assumes that the input is provided in the correct format and does not handle cases where the input is invalid or where the net movement is very large.
