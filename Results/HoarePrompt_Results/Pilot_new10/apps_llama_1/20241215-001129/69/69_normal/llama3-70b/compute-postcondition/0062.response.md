To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions given and how they change as we iterate through `ops`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0.

Given that we are iterating through `ops` one character at a time, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider what happens when we move to the next character in `ops`. 

The conditions regarding `op`, `dy`, and `dx` are maintained as per the given conditions, but we need to update `ux` and `uy` based on the current `op`. If `op` is 'U', `uy` increases by 1. If `op` is 'D', `uy` decreases by 1. If `op` is 'R', `ux` increases by 1. If `op` is 'L', `ux` decreases by 1.

However, we must remember that the loop will execute one more time if there are still characters left in `ops` to process. Thus, the critical condition for the loop to continue is that `ops` must have at least one more character to process.

Since `n` is the length of `ops` and we've processed one character in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the number of characters processed so far. 

But since we're looking at the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `ux` and `uy` would change based on the next `op` in `ops`, and ensure that the conditions regarding `dx` and `dy` can still be met.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `uy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0**
