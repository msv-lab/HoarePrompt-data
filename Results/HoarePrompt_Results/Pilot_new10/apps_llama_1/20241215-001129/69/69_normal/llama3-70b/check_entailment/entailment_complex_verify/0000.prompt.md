You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is attempting to find the minimum length of a subsegment that needs to be changed in a sequence of operations to move a robot from (0, 0) to (x, y). However, it has a logical flaw. 

The issue lies in the way it calculates the minimum length of the subsegment. The current implementation only increments the result counter when it encounters an operation that doesn't contribute to reaching the target coordinates, but it doesn't consider the optimal subsegment to change.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
RURUU
-2 3
```
The expected output is 3, but the program doesn't correctly calculate this. It only checks the operations one by one and doesn't consider the optimal subsegment to change.

The correct approach would be to calculate the differences in x and y coordinates (dx, dy) and then try to find the minimum length subsegment that can be changed to achieve these differences. 

Here is an example of how the correct code might look:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if abs(dx) > n or abs(dy) > n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = n
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                new_ux, new_uy = 0, 0
                for k in range(i):
                    if ops[k] == 'U':
                        new_uy += 1
                    elif ops[k] == 'D':
                        new_uy -= 1
                    elif ops[k] == 'R':
                        new_ux += 1
                    elif ops[k] == 'L':
                        new_ux -= 1
                for k in range(i, j + 1):
                    if dx > 0:
                        new_ux += 1
                        dx -= 1
                    elif dx < 0:
                        new_ux -= 1
                        dx += 1
                    if dy > 0:
                        new_uy += 1
                        dy -= 1
                    elif dy < 0:
                        new_uy -= 1
                        dy += 1
                for k in range(j + 1, n):
                    if ops[k] == 'U':
                        new_uy += 1
                    elif ops[k] == 'D':
                        new_uy -= 1
                    elif ops[k] == 'R':
                        new_ux += 1
                    elif ops[k] == 'L':
                        new_ux -= 1
                if new_ux == x and new_uy == y:
                    res = min(res, j - i + 1)
        if res == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(res)
```
This code checks all possible subsegments and calculates the minimum length of the subsegment that can be changed to achieve the target coordinates.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n, a string of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and two integers x and y.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ux, uy, lx, ly = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0.
    dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy
    if (dx < 0 or dy < 0) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is the final difference between `x` and the net 'R' and 'L' operations, `dy` is the final difference between `y` and the net 'U' and 'D' operations, and `res` is the total number of operations that do not meet the conditions for updating `dy` or `dx`. If `n` is 0, then `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 0.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`. If `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns the total number of operations that do not meet the conditions for updating `dy` or `dx`, denoted as `res`. If `n` is 0, then `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, including the number of operations `n`, a string of `n` operations where each operation is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net movement in the x and y directions based on the operations and checks if the destination (`x`, `y`) is reachable. If the destination is not reachable, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the number of operations that cannot be performed without overshooting the destination. The function assumes that the input is provided in the correct format and does not handle cases where the input is invalid or where the net movement is very large.
