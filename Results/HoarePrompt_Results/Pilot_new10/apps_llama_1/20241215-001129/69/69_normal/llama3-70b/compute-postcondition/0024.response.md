The variable `ux` is not defined in the initial state. However, we can assume that it is intended to be `x`. 

The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer**
