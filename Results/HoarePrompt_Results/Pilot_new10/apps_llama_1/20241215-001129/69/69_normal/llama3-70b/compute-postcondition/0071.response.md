Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `uy` is updated based on the next operation in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0. If the current operation `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the current operation `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is increased by 1, or if the current operation `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1, or if the current operation `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is set to 1, otherwise `res` is increased by 1.**
