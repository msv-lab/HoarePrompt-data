Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`. If `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns the total number of operations that do not meet the conditions for updating `dy` or `dx`, denoted as `res`. If `n` is 0, then `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 0.**
