The code initializes four new variables: `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`, all set to 0. The values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0**.
