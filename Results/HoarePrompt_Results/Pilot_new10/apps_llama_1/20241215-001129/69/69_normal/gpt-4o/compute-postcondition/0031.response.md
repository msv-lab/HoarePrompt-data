The value of `final_x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `final_x` is an integer resulting from the previous operation, so the new value of `final_x` is `final_x + 1` or `x + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` and `y` are integers with values resulting from the previous operation, `final_x` is equal to `x + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` and `y` are integers with values resulting from the previous operation, `final_x` is `x + 1`**
