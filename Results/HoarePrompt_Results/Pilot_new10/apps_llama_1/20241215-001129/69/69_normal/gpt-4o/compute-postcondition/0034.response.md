Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` and `y` are integers with values resulting from the previous operation. If the last operation `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. If the last operation `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. If the last operation `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is increased by 1 from its previous value, if `op` is 'U', the values of `x` and `y` and `final_x` and `final_y` will be as per the previous operations.**
