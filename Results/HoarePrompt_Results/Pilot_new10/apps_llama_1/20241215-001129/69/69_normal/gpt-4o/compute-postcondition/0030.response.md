The code `final_x -= 1` decreases the value of `final_x` by 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, and `y` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `y` is an integer, `final_x` is decreased by 1 from its previous value**
