The function accepts an integer `n`, a string of operations, and integers `x` and `y`, and returns 0 if the target position is the final position after all operations, or the minimum distance between revisits to any position that is `dx` and `dy` away from the current position if such revisits occur, otherwise returns -1, handling all potential edge cases including non-revisitable positions and initial positions.
