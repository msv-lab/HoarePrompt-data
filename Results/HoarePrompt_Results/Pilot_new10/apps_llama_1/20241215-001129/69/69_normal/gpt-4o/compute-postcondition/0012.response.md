Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0, the first character in `operations` is stored in `op`, the current value of `op` is 'R' since `op` is not 'U', `op` is not 'D', and `op` is not 'L', and as per the if condition, `op` equals 'R'**
