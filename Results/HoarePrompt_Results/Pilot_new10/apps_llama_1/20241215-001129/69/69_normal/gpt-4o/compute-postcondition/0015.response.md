Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, if the first character `op` in `operations` is 'L', then `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is 0, otherwise if `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` is 0**
