Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions as keys and their corresponding values, with the initial position (0, 0) having a value of -1 and (`dx`, `dy`) having a value of `i`, `i` is 1. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `target_pos` is either `dx - 1, 1 + dy` or `dx - 1, -1 + dy` or `dx - 2, dy` or `dx, dy` and `current_x` is `dx - 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `x` is `x + 1`, `dx` is `x + 1 - final_x`, and `target_pos` is either `dx + 1, 1 + dy` or `dx + 1, -1 + dy` or `dx, 1 + dy` or `dx + 2, dy`. If `operations[i]` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
