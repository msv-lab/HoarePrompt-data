To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given return statement and the initial state of variables. 

The return statement is `return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1`. 

From the initial state, `min_length` is either the minimum distance between revisits to any position or positive infinity if no position is revisited.

So, the program returns `min_length` if it is not infinity, meaning a position has been revisited and `min_length` holds the minimum distance between such revisits. 

If `min_length` is infinity, it means no position has been revisited, so the program returns -1.

Output State: **The program returns the minimum distance between revisits to any position if such revisits occur, otherwise it returns -1**
