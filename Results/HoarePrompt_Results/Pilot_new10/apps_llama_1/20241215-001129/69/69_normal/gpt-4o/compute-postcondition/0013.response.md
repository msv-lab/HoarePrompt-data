The code increments `final_x` by 1. The previous value of `final_x` was 0, so the new value of `final_x` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, the first character in `operations` is stored in `op`, the current value of `op` is 'R'**
