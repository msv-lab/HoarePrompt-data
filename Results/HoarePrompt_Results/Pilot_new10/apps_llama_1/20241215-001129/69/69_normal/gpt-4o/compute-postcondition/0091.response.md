Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and greater than the new `i`, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `position_map` contains updated positions including (`current_x`, `current_y`) with the value of the previous `i`, `target_pos` is (`current_x + x - final_x`, `current_y + y - final_y`), and `i` is the previous `i` plus one. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`.***
