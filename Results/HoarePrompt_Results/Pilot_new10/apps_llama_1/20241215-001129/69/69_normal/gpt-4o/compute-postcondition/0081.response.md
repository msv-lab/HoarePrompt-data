To calculate the output state, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program.

The code `current_y += 1` increments the value of `current_y` by 1. 

The initial state provides the following information: 
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than the new `i`
- `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'
- `x` is an integer
- `y` is an integer
- `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`
- `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`
- `dx` is `x - final_x`
- `dy` is `y - final_y`
- `position_map` contains updated positions including (`current_x`, `current_y`) with the value of the previous `i`
- `i` is the previous `i` plus one

After executing the code, `current_y` is incremented by 1, so `current_y` becomes `current_y + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer and greater than the new `i`, 
`operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', 
`x` is an integer, 
`y` is an integer, 
`final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, 
`final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, 
`dx` is `x - final_x`, 
`dy` is `y - final_y`, 
`position_map` contains updated positions including (`current_x`, `current_y + 1`) with the value of the previous `i`, 
`i` is the previous `i` plus one, 
`current_y` is `current_y + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than the new `i`, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `position_map` contains updated positions including (`current_x`, `current_y + 1`) with the value of the previous `i`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, `current_y` is `current_y + 1`**
