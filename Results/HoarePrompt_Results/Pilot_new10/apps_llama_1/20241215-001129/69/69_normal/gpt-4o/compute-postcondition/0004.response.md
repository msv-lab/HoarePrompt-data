The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `final_y` is 0, so the new value of `final_y` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still a positive integer, `operations` is still a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is still an integer, `y` is still an integer, the first character in `operations` is still stored in `op`, and the current value of `op` is still 'U'. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, the first character in `operations` is stored in `op`, and the current value of `op` is 'U'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, the first character in `operations` is stored in `op`, and the current value of `op` is 'U'**
