Correctness: **False**.

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case when the minimum size frame cannot be formed. According to the problem description, if the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1. However, the program only checks if the frame size is greater than the maximum of n and m, which is not sufficient to determine if the frame can be formed.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
w..
..w
...
```
The program will output:
```
w+.
.+w
...
```
However, the correct output should be -1 because the minimum size frame cannot be formed with the given white pixels.

The program should correctly check if the white pixels can form a square frame of any size and print -1 if it is not possible. 

Here is an improved version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m) or max_x - min_x!= max_y - min_y:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))

```
This code checks if the frame size is greater than the maximum of n and m or if the frame size is not a square, and prints -1 in these cases.
