Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `top` is `None`, then `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`. If `top` is not `None`, then if `j` is less than `left`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `i` may be updated based on the comparison of `i` and `bottom`, and the value of `right` is updated if `j` is greater than `right`. If `j` is not less than `left`, the original values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `i` are retained, and the value of `right` is updated if `j` is greater than `right`.***
