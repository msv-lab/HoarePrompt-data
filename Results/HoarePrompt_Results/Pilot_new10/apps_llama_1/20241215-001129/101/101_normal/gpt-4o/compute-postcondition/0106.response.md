Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 0, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`, and the current value of `screen` at index `[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` equals 2, otherwise, the state of the variables remains as in the precondition.**
