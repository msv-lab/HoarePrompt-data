Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `j` equals 2, `left` equals 2 or 1, `right` equals 2, `i` equals 2 if `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` equals `i` if `i` > `bottom`, or its original value if no conditions for change were met. Otherwise, the state remains as initially described: `j` equals 2, `left` equals 1 or 2, `right` equals 1, `i` equals 2 if `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` equals `i` if `i` > `bottom`, or its original value if no conditions for change were met.**
