According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, but since `i` equals 2 and we are considering the first row of `screen` for updating `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`, we assume the loop has just started for `i` equals 2. So `j` must be 0 at the start of the first iteration for `i` equals 2. At the end of the last iteration for `i` equals 2, `j` must be less than `m`. For the loop to execute again for `i` equals 2, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1**
