To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Loop Conditions and Variables**: The loop iterates over a range from `left` to `right` (inclusive), affecting the `result` 2D list based on conditions involving `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. The `result` list is initially a copy of the `screen` list of strings.

2. **Changes to `result`**: Within the loop, if the current position `[i][j]` in `result` is at the border (i.e., `i` equals `top` or `bottom`, or `j` equals `left` or `right`), and the character at that position is '.', it is changed to '+'.

3. **Output States After Iterations**: The provided output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations show that `result` is updated based on its position relative to the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. If a position is at the border and initially '.', it becomes '+'.

4. **Determining Final Output State**: Considering the loop iterates over all positions from `left` to `right`, the final state of `result` will reflect all border positions (as defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`) being updated to '+' if they were initially '.'. Non-border positions or those not satisfying the update condition remain unchanged.

Given these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

- `n` and `m` retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
- `screen` remains unchanged as it is only used to initialize `result`.
- `i` and `j` may take on various values during the loop but are not significant in the final output state description beyond their role in conditioning updates to `result`.
- `left` and `right` define the horizontal bounds of the iteration.
- `top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, with `bottom` being at least `top + 1`.
- `frame_height` and `frame_width` are constraints on the dimensions of the frame but do not directly influence the loop's output.
- `result` is the 2D list of characters where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen`, with all border positions (as defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`) updated to '+' if they were initially '.'.

Therefore, considering the loop's behavior and the provided information:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` and `right` define the iteration range, `top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, and `result` is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a modified copy of the corresponding row in `screen` with all border positions (at `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`) changed to '+' if they were initially '.'.**
