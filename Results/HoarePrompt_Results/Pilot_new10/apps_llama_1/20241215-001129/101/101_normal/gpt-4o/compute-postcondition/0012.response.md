To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters.
- If `i` is less than `top`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, and `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w'.
- Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` retain their original values and `screen` also retains its original state.
- The current value of `i` is greater than the current value of `bottom`.

The code to execute is:
```python
bottom = i
```

This code updates the value of `bottom` to be equal to the current value of `i`.

Output State:
**`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `i` was less than `top`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is 0, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, and the current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w'. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `top`, `left`, `right` retain their original values and `screen` also retains its original state. `bottom` is now equal to `i`. The value of `i` is greater than or equal to the new value of `bottom` because `bottom` has been updated to be equal to `i`.**
