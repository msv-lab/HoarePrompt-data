The code `left = j` updates the value of `left` to be equal to the current value of `j`. The current value of `j` is 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, 
`m` is a positive integer, 
`screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 0, 
the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', 
the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', 
`top` is either 1 or its previous value, 
if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is 1, otherwise, the current value of `bottom` remains unchanged, 
`left` is 0, 
`right` remains as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`, 
and the current value of `j` is equal to the current value of `left`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is either 1 or its previous value, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is 1, otherwise, the current value of `bottom` remains unchanged, `left` is 0, `right` remains as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`, and `j` is equal to `left`.**
