Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If the original value of `i` was less than `top`, then the current value of `i` is 0, the current value of `j` is 0 if the updated `j` is less than `left`, `top` is 0, `right` is `None`, `left` is 0 if the updated `j` is less than `left`, otherwise `left` is equal to the updated `j`, and the current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w'. If the original value of `i` was greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to the original value of `i`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to the new value of `bottom`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then no changes are made to `i`, `j`, `top`, `right`, `left`, `bottom`, or `screen`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `j`, `top`, `right`, `left`, `bottom`, or `screen`.**
