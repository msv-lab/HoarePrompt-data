Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are updated based on their original values and the current values of `i` and `j`. Specifically, if `top` is `None`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to `j`, and `right` is set to `j`. If `top` is not `None`, then the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `i` may be updated based on the comparison of `i` and `bottom`, and the value of `right` is updated if `j` is greater than `right`. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', then the original values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` are retained.**
