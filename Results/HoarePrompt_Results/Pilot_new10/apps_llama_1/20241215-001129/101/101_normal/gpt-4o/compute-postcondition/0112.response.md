Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` or 2 if `i` is less than `top`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` equals `j` which is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` equals 2 and the current value of `screen` at index `[i][j]` is 'w', otherwise the state of the variables remains as in the precondition, with `bottom` being its original value; if `j` is not less than `left`, then the state of the variables remains as in the precondition.**
