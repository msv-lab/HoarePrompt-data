Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is 0, `right` is `None`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, the original values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` are retained.**
