You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

                        bottom = i

                        left = j

    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not verify if all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame. It simply finds the bounding box of all white pixels and then constructs a frame around it.

Here's a counterexample: 

Input:
```
4 4
w...
....
....
...w
```
In this case, the program will output:
```
w+++
....
....
...w
```
However, this frame does not satisfy the condition that all white pixels are on the frame. The correct output should be -1.

The program should check if all white pixels are on the frame after constructing it. If not, it should return -1. 

Additionally, the program does not consider the possibility that there may be multiple frames with the same minimum size. It should handle this case according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly check if all white pixels are on the frame and to handle the case where there are multiple frames with the same minimum size. 

Here is an example of how it could be modified:
```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    # Check if all white pixels are on the frame
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w' and (i < top or i > bottom or j < left or j > right):
                return -1
            if screen[i][j] == 'w' and top <= i <= bottom and left <= j <= right and i!= top and i!= bottom and j!= left and j!= right:
                return -1
    return result
```
This modification checks if all white pixels are on the frame by verifying that there are no white pixels outside the frame and that there are no white pixels inside the frame that are not on the border. 

However, this code still does not handle the case where there are multiple frames with the same minimum size. To handle this case, we need to modify the code to generate all possible frames and then select the one with the minimum size. 

Here is a possible implementation:
```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if screen[i][j] == 'w']
    min_size = float('inf')
    result = None
    for size in range(2, n + m):
        for top in range(n - size + 1):
            for left in range(m - size + 1):
                frame = [(i, j) for i in range(top, top + size) for j in range(left, left + size) if i == top or i == top + size - 1 or j == left or j == left + size - 1]
                if set(white_pixels).issubset(set(frame)):
                    if size < min_size:
                        min_size = size
                        result = [list(row) for row in screen]
                        for i in range(top, top + size):
                            for j in range(left, left + size):
                                if i == top or i == top + size - 1 or j == left or j == left + size - 1:
                                    if result[i][j] == '.':
                                        result[i][j] = '+'
    if result is None:
        return -1
    return result
```
This implementation generates all possible frames and checks if all white pixels are on the frame. It selects the frame with the minimum size and returns it. If no frame is found, it returns -1. 

Note that this implementation has a high time complexity due to the generation of all possible frames. It may not be efficient for large inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, and screen is a list of strings of length m, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters.

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:

The `result` has a height of `frame_height` which is `bottom - top + 1` and a width of `frame_width` which is `right - left + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. It finds the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`. If no 'w' characters are found, or if the height or width of this bounding box is less than 2, it returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a copy of `screen`, replaces all "." characters at the border positions of the bounding box with "+", and returns this modified copy.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
