Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values with `i` being 1 and `j` being 2, otherwise the state of the variables is unchanged as the else part does not modify them, but since there is no else part, the else condition does not affect the state***
