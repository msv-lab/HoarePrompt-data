Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `i` was less than `top`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is 0, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, and the current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w'. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `top`, `left`, `right` retain their original values and `screen` also retains its original state. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to `i`, and `i` is greater than or equal to the new value of `bottom`.**
