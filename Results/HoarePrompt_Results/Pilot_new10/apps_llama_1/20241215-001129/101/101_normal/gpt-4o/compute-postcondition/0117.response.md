Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then either the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition with `j` equals 0 and `screen[i][j]` is 'w', or `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are updated to be the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` and the current position `[i][j]`. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition with `i` equals 2 and `j` equals 0.***
