Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `j` equals 2, `left` equals 2, `right` equals 1, `i` equals 2 if `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` equals `i` if `i` > `bottom`, otherwise `bottom` is unchanged, otherwise, the state remains as initially described: `j` equals 2, `left` equals 1, `right` equals 1, `i` equals 2 if `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` equals `i` if `i` > `bottom`, or its original value if no conditions for change were met**
