The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Given the initial state, `j` equals 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given `i` equals 2, and the condition "if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` equals 2 and `bottom` equals 2" is still valid because `i` is indeed greater than a potential `bottom` value (as `i` is 2 and `bottom` could be less than 2 for this condition to be true when `i` > `bottom`), but since we do not have a specific value for `bottom` and the only condition given is when `i` > `bottom`, we consider the general case that could satisfy this condition without contradicting the given values.

So, considering all variables, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, and the condition regarding `top` and `bottom` when `i` > `bottom`, we find that `left` is now equal to `j`, which is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `left` equals 1, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` equals 2 and `bottom` equals 2**
