The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. It finds the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`. If no 'w' characters are found, or if the height or width of this bounding box is less than 2, it returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a copy of `screen`, replaces all "." characters at the border positions of the bounding box with "+", and returns this modified copy.
