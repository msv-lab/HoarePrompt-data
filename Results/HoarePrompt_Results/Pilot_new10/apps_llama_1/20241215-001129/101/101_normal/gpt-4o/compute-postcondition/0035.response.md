According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m` and the current value of `j`. If `j` is less than `m-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `j` is the next integer value**
