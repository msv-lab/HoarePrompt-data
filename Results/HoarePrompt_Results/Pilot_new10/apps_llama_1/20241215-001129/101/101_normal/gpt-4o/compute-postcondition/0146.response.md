Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are either the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen` or `None` if no 'w' characters are found. The current value of at least one of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` is `None`.**
