The code `top = bottom = i` updates the values of `top` and `bottom` to be equal to `i`. Given that `i` equals 2, `top` and `bottom` will both be assigned the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `left` equals 1, `right` equals 1, `top` equals 2, `bottom` equals 2**
