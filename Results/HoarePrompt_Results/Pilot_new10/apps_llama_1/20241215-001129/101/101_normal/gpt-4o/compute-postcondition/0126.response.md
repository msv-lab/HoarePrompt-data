Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, if `j` is less than `left`, then `j` equals 1, `left` equals 1, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` equals 2 and `bottom` equals 2; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them***
