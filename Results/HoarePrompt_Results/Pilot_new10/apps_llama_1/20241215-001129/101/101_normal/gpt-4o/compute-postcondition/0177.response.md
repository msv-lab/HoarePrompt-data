Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters. If `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, then if the character at position `(i, j)` was '.', it is now '+'.***
