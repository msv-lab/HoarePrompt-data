To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the initial state. The code provided is `left = right = j`. 

Given that `j` equals 2, we can substitute `j` with 2 in the code, resulting in `left = right = 2`. 

This means that both `left` and `right` will be updated to 2.

The initial state also mentions other variables: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `top` equals 2, and `bottom` equals 2. Since the code only affects `left` and `right`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `left` equals 2, `right` equals 2, `top` equals 2, `bottom` equals 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `left` equals 2, `right` equals 2, `top` equals 2, `bottom` equals 2**
