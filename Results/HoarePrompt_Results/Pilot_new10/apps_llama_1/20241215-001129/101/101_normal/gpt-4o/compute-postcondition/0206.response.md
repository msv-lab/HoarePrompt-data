To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's break down the code and the given annotations.

1. **Parameters and Initial Conditions**: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `screen` is a list of strings, where each string has a length of `m` and consists of only "." and "w" characters.

2. **Finding 'w' Characters**: The function iterates through the `screen` to find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters, which are stored in `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` variables, respectively. If no 'w' characters are found, all these variables remain `None`.

3. **Return Conditions**:
   - If any of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` are `None` (indicating no 'w' characters were found), the function returns -1.
   - After finding the bounding box of 'w' characters, the function checks if the height (`frame_height = bottom - top + 1`) or width (`frame_width = right - left + 1`) of this box is less than 2. If either condition is true, it returns -1.

4. **Modifying the Screen**:
   - If the height and width are both 2 or more, the function creates a copy of the `screen` (named `result`) and iterates over the bounding box of 'w' characters.
   - For each position at the border of this box (top, bottom, left, or right), if the character is ".", it replaces it with "+" in the `result`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns the modified `result`, which is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a modified copy of the corresponding row in `screen`, with all "." characters at the border positions (at `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`) replaced with "+".

Based on the provided annotations and the code, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. It finds the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`. If no 'w' characters are found, or if the height or width of this bounding box is less than 2, it returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a copy of `screen`, replaces all "." characters at the border positions of the bounding box with "+", and returns this modified copy. **
