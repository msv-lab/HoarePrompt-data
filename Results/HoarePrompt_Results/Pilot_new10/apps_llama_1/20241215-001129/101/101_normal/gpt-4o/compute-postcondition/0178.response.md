According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left`, `right`, and `j`. If `j` is less than `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to `left` since it just started, but for the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` is now `left + 1`. For the loop to execute again `left + 1` must be less than or equal to `right`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` plus one must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters, `j` is `left + 1`**
