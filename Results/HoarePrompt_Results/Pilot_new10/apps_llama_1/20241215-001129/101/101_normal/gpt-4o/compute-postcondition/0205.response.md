The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are positive integers, and `screen`, which is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following cases: 

1. The program returns -1.
2. The program returns -1.
3. The program returns a 2D list of characters `result` where each inner list is a modified copy of the corresponding row in `screen` with all '.' characters at the border positions replaced with '+'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, and return either -1 or a modified 2D list of characters based on the specified conditions.
