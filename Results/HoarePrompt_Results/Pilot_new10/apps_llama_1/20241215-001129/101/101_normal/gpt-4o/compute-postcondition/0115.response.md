Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `left` is 0 and `right` is `j`. `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` or 2 if `i` is less than `top`. `bottom` is 2 if `i` is greater than its original value, otherwise its original value. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, the value of `screen` at index `[i][j]` is 'w'. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the state of the variables remains as in the precondition.**
