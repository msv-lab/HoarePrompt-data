The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The value of `i` is 1, so both `top` and `bottom` are assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1**
