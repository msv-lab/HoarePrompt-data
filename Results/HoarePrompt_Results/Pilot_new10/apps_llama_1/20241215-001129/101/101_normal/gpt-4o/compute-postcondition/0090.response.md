The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `bottom` is 1. In this case, `left` is assigned the value 2. Otherwise, `j` can be any value, and `left` is assigned this value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `bottom` is 1, and `left` is 2, otherwise `left` is equal to `j`.**
