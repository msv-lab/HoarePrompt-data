Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `top` is 1, regardless of the value of `bottom`, since `i` equals 1 and the if condition `i > bottom` will always be false when `bottom` is 1 or more.**
