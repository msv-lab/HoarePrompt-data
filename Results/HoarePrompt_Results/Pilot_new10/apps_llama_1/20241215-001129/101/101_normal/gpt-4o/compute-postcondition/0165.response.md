Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is `right`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is greater than `j`, `top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices of all 'w' characters in `screen` with `bottom` being at least `top + 1`, `frame_height` is at least 2, `frame_width` is at least 2, and `result` is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen`. If `i` equals `top`, `i` equals `bottom`, `j` equals `left`, or `j` equals `right`, then if `result[i][j]` is '.', `result[i][j]` is updated to '+', otherwise `result` remains unchanged.**
