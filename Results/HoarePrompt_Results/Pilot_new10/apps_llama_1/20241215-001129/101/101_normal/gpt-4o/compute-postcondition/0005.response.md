The code `top = bottom = i` updates the values of `top` and `bottom` to be equal to `i`. Given that `i` is 0, `top` and `bottom` will both be assigned the value 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `m` remains a positive integer, `screen` remains a list of strings of length `m` where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters, `left` and `right` remain `None`, and `j` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
