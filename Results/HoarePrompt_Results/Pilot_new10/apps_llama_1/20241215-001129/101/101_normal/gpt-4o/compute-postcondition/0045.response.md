Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` equals `j`. Regardless of the condition, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` equals `j`. Also, `top` equals `i` if `i` is less than the previous `top`, and `bottom` equals `i` if `i` is greater than the previous `bottom`.**
