Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. `top` is not None. The current value of `i` is less than the current value of `top`.**
