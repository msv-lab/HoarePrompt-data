The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `top`. Since `i` equals 2, `top` is assigned the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `top` equals 2**
