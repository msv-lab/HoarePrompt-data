The code creates a new variable `result` which is a 2D list of characters, where each inner list represents a row in the `screen`. This is done by iterating over each row in `screen` and converting it to a list of characters.

The initial state of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` does not change. 

`result` is assigned the value of a list of lists, where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`, and both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`, and both `frame_height` and `frame_width` are greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen`.**
