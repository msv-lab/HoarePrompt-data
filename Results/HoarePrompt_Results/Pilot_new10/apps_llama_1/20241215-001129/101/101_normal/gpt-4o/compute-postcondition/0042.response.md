`left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is the next integer value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `j` is the next integer value, `left` is equal to `j`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` equals `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `j` is the next integer value, `left` equals `j`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` equals `i`.**
