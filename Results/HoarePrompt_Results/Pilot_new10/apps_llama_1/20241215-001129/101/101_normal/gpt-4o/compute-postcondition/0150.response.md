The value of `frame_width` is calculated as `right - left + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a positive integer, `m` is still a positive integer, `screen` is still a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is still `n-1`, `j` is still `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are still the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is still `bottom - top + 1`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.**
