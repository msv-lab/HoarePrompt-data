The code `frame_height = bottom - top + 1` assigns the value of `bottom - top + 1` to the variable `frame_height`. The values of `bottom` and `top` are the minimum and maximum row indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, respectively. 

The states of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.**
