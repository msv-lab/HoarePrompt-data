The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `bottom` is 1, if `i` is less than `top`, then `i` equals 1, `j` equals 1, and `top` equals 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1**
