The character at position `(i, j)` in `result` is updated to '+'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters where the character at position `(i, j)` is '+', `i` is `top + 1`, and `j` is `left`. Either the current value of `i` equals `top`, or the current value of `i` equals `bottom`, or the current value of `j` equals `left`, or the current value of `j` equals `right`.
