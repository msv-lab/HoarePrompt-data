Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, if `screen[i][j]` equals 'w', then `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `left` equals 1, if `top` is None, then `top` equals 2, `bottom` equals 2, `right` equals 1; otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `right`, then `j` equals 1, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` equals 2 and `bottom` equals 2, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` retain their values, otherwise, `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j` retain their original values as `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1.**
