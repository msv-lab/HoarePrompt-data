Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. The current value of `top` is 0. If the original value of `i` was less than `top`, then the current value of `i` is 0, the current value of `j` is 0 if the original value of `j` is less than the original value of `left`, and `left` is 0. Otherwise, `left` is equal to the original value of `j`. The current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w' if the original value of `i` was less than `top`. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `right`, and `screen` retain their original values, `left` is equal to the original value of `j` if the original value of `j` is less than the original value of `left`. If the original value of `i` was greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to the original value of `i`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to the new value of `bottom`. The current value of `j` is greater than the current value of `right`.**
