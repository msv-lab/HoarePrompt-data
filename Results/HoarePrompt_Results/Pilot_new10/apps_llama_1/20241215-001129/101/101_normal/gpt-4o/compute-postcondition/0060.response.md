The value of `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is either 1 or its previous value, `bottom` is 1, `left` and `right` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is either 1 or its previous value, `bottom` is 1, `left` and `right` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`**
