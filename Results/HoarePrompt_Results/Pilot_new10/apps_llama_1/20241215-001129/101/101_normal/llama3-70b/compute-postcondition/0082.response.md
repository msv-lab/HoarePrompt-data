Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 1`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where if a cell is on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` and its original value is `'.'`, then its value is `'+'`, otherwise if its value is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`, and all other cells are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `max_y` and `min_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, `j` is 1. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` equals `'+'`. If `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`, then `i` and `j` proceed to the next iteration based on the loop's progression rules. If `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'` and it is not the case that `i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`, then `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, and `j` is 1.***
