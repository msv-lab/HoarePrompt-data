The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of their current values and `x` and `y` respectively. Since `x` and `y` are the first coordinates in the `white_pixels` list, they must be the coordinates of a 'w' valued pixel in `pixels`.

The initial values of `min_x` and `min_y` are `float('inf')`, which means they are positive infinity. When we compare `x` and `y` with `float('inf')`, `x` and `y` will always be smaller because they are coordinates of pixels in `pixels` and are therefore integers between 0 and `n-1` or `m-1` respectively.

So, `min_x` becomes `x` and `min_y` becomes `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 1 coordinate, `min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`, `x` and `y` are the first coordinates in the `white_pixels` list**
