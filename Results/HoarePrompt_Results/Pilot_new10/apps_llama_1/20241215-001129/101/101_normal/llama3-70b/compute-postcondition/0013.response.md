To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we should analyze the function of the loop and how it affects the variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` based on the coordinates in `white_pixels`.

The loop iterates over each pair of coordinates `(x, y)` in `white_pixels`. For each iteration, it updates `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of their current values and `x` and `y`, respectively. Similarly, it updates `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum of their current values and `x` and `y`, respectively.

This means that after all iterations, `min_x` will hold the smallest x-coordinate among all the coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` will hold the smallest y-coordinate, `max_x` will hold the largest x-coordinate, and `max_y` will hold the largest y-coordinate.

If `white_pixels` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, `min_x` and `min_y` will remain `float('inf')` because they were initialized as such and never updated. Similarly, `max_x` and `max_y` will remain `float('-inf')` because they were initialized as such and never updated.

Given this analysis, the output state can be described as follows:

- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`.
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w".
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`.
- If `white_pixels` is not empty, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate among all the coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate, and `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate.
- If `white_pixels` is empty, `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, and `max_y` is `float('-inf')`.

Therefore, the loop's output state after all iterations have finished can be summarized as:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`.**
