According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not explicitly given but based on the condition that either (`i` equals the current value of `min_x` or `i` equals the current value of `max_x` or `j` equals the current value of `min_y` or `j` equals the current value of `max_y`) and at position `[i][j]` in `pixels` is '+', or (`pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and `(i, j)` is in `white_pixels`) or (`pixels[i][j]` is '.' and `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 and `pixels[0][0]` equals `'.'` with `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` and `frame_size` updated accordingly), we can infer that `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to have executed. Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration but we can deduce that for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next integer after its current value. The other variables' states do not change due to the loop's nature, which only increments `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w" or '+', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and either (`i` equals the current value of `min_x` or `i` equals the current value of `max_x` or `j` equals the current value of `min_y` or `j` equals the current value of `max_y`) and at position `[i][j]` in `pixels` is '+', or (`pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and `(i, j)` is in `white_pixels`) or (`pixels[i][j]` is '.' and `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 and `pixels[0][0]` equals `'.'` with `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` and `frame_size` updated accordingly) and `j` is incremented by 1**
