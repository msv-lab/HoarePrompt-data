Given the initial state: 
`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, 
`m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 2`, 
`pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row has been updated according to border conditions, 
`white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, 
`min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, 
`min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, 
`frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, 
`i` is the next integer, 
`j` is 2.
If ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and the old value of `pixels[i][j]` equals '.'), then `pixels[i][j]` equals '+', otherwise if `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration, otherwise `pixels[i][j]` equals '.' and the border conditions have been applied.

The provided code is:
```python
pixels[i][j] = '+'
```
This means `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value '+'. Given the conditions around this assignment, it must be that either `i` equals `min_x`, `i` equals `max_x`, `j` equals `min_y`, or `j` equals `max_y`, and the old value of `pixels[i][j]` equals '.'. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, 
`m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 2`, 
`pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` equals '+', 
`white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, 
`min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, 
`min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, 
`frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, 
`i` is the next integer, 
`j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 2`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` equals '+', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer, `j` is 2**
