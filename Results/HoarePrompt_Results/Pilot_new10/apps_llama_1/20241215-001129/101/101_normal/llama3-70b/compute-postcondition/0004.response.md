According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 1 coordinate, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, `min_x` and `min_y` are `float('inf')` and `max_x` and `max_y` are `float('-inf')`, indicating that no minimum or maximum x or y coordinates have been found yet. So for the loop to be executed, the list `white_pixels` must have at least 1 coordinate, and `x` and `y` are the first coordinates in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 1 coordinate, `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`, `x` and `y` are the first coordinates in the `white_pixels` list**
