The code initializes four variables: `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` to positive infinity, positive infinity, negative infinity, and negative infinity respectively. 

`min_x` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which is a representation of positive infinity in Python. 
`min_y` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which is a representation of positive infinity in Python. 
`max_x` is assigned the value `float('-inf')`, which is a representation of negative infinity in Python. 
`max_y` is assigned the value `float('-inf')`, which is a representation of negative infinity in Python.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`**
