To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's break down the information provided and analyze the loop's behavior.

The loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` 2D list and prints the string representation of the row to the console. The loop does not modify any variables; it only performs an action (printing).

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can infer:
- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, which defines the size of the `pixels` 2D list.
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the values can be `'.'`, `'+'`, or `'w'`, depending on the initial conditions and the coordinates `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`.
- `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` are calculated based on the original `pixels` and do not change during the loop execution.
- The loop will execute `n` times because it iterates over each row in `pixels`, and `pixels` has `n` rows.

Given this information, after the loop has finished executing, the state of the variables will be:
- `n` remains an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`.
- `m` remains an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`.
- `pixels` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` with its original or modified values based on the border conditions.
- `white_pixels` remains a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in the original `pixels`.
- `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` remain the smallest and largest x and y coordinates in `white_pixels`, respectively.
- `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, based on the original calculations.
- The string representation of each row in `pixels` has been printed to the console.

If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the provided conditions that `n` and `m` are positive integers), the output state would essentially be the initial state, as no changes or actions would have occurred.

Considering all iterations have finished, the output state will reflect that each row has been processed (i.e., printed), but the values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain as they were initially or as calculated before the loop started, since the loop does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in the original `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and the string representation of each row in `pixels` has been printed to the console.**
