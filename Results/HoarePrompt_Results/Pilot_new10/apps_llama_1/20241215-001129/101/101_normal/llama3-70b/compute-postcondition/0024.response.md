The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. 

The states of the variables `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, and `j` are not affected. 

However, we should note that the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'. Since `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, the coordinates `(i, j)` should be in `white_pixels`. 

Since previously `pixels[i][j]` was equal to '.', but the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', this means `(i, j)` was not in `white_pixels` before, but it should be in `white_pixels` now.

Also, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, and it is not the case that (`i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`), but since `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` may change because `(i, j)` is now in `white_pixels`. 

If `white_pixels` was empty before, then `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` will be updated to `i`, `j`, `i`, `j` respectively, and `frame_size` will be updated to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` which is 1.

If `white_pixels` was not empty before, then `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` will be updated accordingly if `(i, j)` is smaller or larger than the previous `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` will be updated to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w" and `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` and `(i, j)` is in `white_pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
