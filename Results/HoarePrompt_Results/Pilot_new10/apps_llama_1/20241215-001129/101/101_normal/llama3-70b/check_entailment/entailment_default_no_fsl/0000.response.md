Correctness: **False**

The given Python program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the bounding box of the white pixels and then creating a frame around that box. However, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases.

One case where the program does not work as expected is when there are white pixels that are not on the border of the bounding box. According to the problem description, the frame should only consist of pixels that are on the border of the square, not fully surrounded by other pixels of the square. However, the code does not check if a white pixel is on the border of the bounding box or not.

Another issue with the code is that it does not correctly check if the frame size is within the monitor's dimensions. The code only checks if the frame size is greater than the maximum of the monitor's width and height, but it should also check if the frame is completely within the monitor's boundaries.

For example, if the input is:
```
4 4
w...
....
....
...w
```
The program will output:
```
w...
....
....
...w
```
But the correct output should be:
```
w+++
+..+
+..+
+++w
```
This is because the program does not correctly create a frame around the white pixels.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
