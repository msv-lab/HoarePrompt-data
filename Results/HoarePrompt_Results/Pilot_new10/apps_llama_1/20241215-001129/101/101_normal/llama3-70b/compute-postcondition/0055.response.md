The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not given any loop in the code snippet, we will assume that this `continue` statement is inside a loop. 

When the `continue` statement is executed, it skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. 

However, since there is no code after the `continue` statement in the given snippet, and we do not know the loop it is part of, we cannot determine what happens after the `continue` statement.

Given the information and the initial state, we know that `n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 1`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer, `j` is 1.

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only skips to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 1`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer, `j` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
