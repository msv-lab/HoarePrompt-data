According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context and `n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Also, `j` is `m-1`, which doesn't affect the loop condition, but its value will remain the same in the next iteration since it's not modified within the loop. 

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where if a cell is on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `min_y` and its original value is `'.'`, then its value is `'+'`, otherwise if its value is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`, and all other cells are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, `j` is `m-1`**
