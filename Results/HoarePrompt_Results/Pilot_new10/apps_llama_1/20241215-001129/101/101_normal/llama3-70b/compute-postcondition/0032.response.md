The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'.'`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected, but the state of `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` may be indirectly affected if the previous value of `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`. 

If the previous value of `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, then `(i, j)` is removed from `white_pixels`. If `(i, j)` was the smallest or largest x or y coordinate in `white_pixels`, then `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, or `max_y` is updated to the new smallest or largest x or y coordinate in `white_pixels`. If `white_pixels` becomes empty, then `min_x` and `min_y` are updated to `float('inf')` and `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to `float('-inf')`. 

The value of `frame_size` is updated to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` if `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, or `max_y` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w" or '+', `pixels[i][j]` is '.', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` with `(i, j)` removed if it was present, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and either (`i` equals the current value of `min_x` or `i` equals the current value of `max_x` or `j` equals the current value of `min_y` or `j` equals the current value of `max_y`) or (`pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and `(i, j)` is in `white_pixels`) or (`pixels[i][j]` is '.' and `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 and `pixels[0][0]` equals `'.'` with `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` and `frame_size` updated accordingly) and `j` is incremented by 1**
