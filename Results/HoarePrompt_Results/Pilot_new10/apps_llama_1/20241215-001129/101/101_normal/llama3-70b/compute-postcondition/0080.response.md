The value of `pixels` at position `(i, j)` is updated to `'.'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `pixels[i][j]` was either `'+'` or `'w'` before the update. Now it is `'.'`. 

The conditions `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 1` are still valid. 

The `white_pixels` list remains unchanged because it is a list of coordinates of `'w'` valued pixels in `pixels`, and `pixels[i][j]` was not `'w'` after the execution of the code.

`min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `max_y` and `min_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, and these values are still valid because `white_pixels` is unchanged.

`frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, this condition is still valid.

`i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one and `j` is 1, these conditions are still valid.

The cell at `(i, j)` in `pixels` is now `'.'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 1`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `max_y` and `min_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, and `j` is 1**
