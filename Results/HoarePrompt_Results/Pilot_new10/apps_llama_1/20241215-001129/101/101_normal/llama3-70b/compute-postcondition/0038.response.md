The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` changes the value of the element at position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` 2D list to `'.'`. 

The state of the variables `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, and `i` remains the same. 

`j` was incremented by 1 before the execution of the code. 

The condition that either (`i` equals the current value of `min_x` or `i` equals the current value of `max_x` or `j-1` equals the current value of `min_y` or `j-1` equals the current value of `max_y`) and at position `[i][j-1]` in `pixels` is '+' or (`pixels[i][j-1]` is 'w' and `(i, j-1)` is in `white_pixels`) or (`pixels[i][j-1]` is '.' and `i` is 0 and `j-1` is 0 and `pixels[0][0]` equals `'.'`), is a precondition. 

At position `[i][j]` in `pixels` is now `'.'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w" or '+', `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` equals `j before the code execution + 1`, and at position `[i][j-1]` in `pixels` before the code execution was either (`i` equals the current value of `min_x` or `i` equals the current value of `max_x` or `j-1` equals the current value of `min_y` or `j-1` equals the current value of `max_y`) and at position `[i][j-1]` in `pixels` is '+' or (`pixels[i][j-1]` is 'w' and `(i, j-1)` is in `white_pixels`) or (`pixels[i][j-1]` is '.' and `i` is 0 and `j-1` is 0 and `pixels[0][0]` equals `'.'`)**
