According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` variable. Since `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, for the loop to execute, `pixels` must not be empty, meaning `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, each row in `pixels` is a list of `m` elements, so `m` must also be greater than 0.

Since `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, this condition is already met. The loop will iterate over each row in `pixels`. 

At the start of the loop, `row` will be the first row in `pixels`.

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `row` is the first row in `pixels`**
