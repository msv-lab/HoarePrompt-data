To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the code:
```python
white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
```
And the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, representing the resolution of the monitor.
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w".

The code snippet uses list comprehension to generate a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates `(i, j)` of the elements in the `pixels` 2D list that have the value `'w'`. 

The impact of this code on the program is the creation of a new variable `white_pixels` that holds these coordinates. The states of `n`, `m`, and `pixels` are not changed by this operation.

Therefore, after executing this code, the output state is:
- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, representing the resolution of the monitor.
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w".
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates `(i, j)` of the white pixels in the `pixels` 2D list, specifically those where `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`**
