The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of their current values and the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, respectively.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 3 coordinates, `min_x` is the minimum of the previous `min_x` and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of the previous `min_y` and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of the current `max_x` and the x-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `max_y` is the maximum of the current `max_y` and the y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `x` is the x-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel**
