The code snippet provided is `print(-1)`. This statement simply prints the value -1 to the console. It does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program in any way other than producing output.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w"
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`
- `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('inf')`
- `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('inf')`
- `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('-inf')`
- `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('-inf')`
- `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and the current value of `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`

The print statement does not alter any of these variables or their relationships. The output of the program is `-1`, but this does not change the program's state regarding the variables and their conditions. Thus, after executing the code:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and the current value of `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, and the value `-1` has been printed.**
