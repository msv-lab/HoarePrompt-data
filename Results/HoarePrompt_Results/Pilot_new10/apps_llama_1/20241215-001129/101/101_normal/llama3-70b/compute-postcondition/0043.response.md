According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is already given as an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, which means `m` is already guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states, we need to consider the loop variable `j`. Since the loop is `for j in range(m):`, `j` will start from 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row has been updated according to border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer, `j` is 0**
