Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not verify if all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame. It simply finds the bounding box of all white pixels and then constructs a frame around it.

Here's a counterexample: 

Input:
```
4 4
w...
....
....
...w
```
In this case, the program will output:
```
w+++
....
....
...w
```
However, this frame does not satisfy the condition that all white pixels are on the frame. The correct output should be -1.

The program should check if all white pixels are on the frame after constructing it. If not, it should return -1. 

Additionally, the program does not consider the possibility that there may be multiple frames with the same minimum size. It should handle this case according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly check if all white pixels are on the frame and to handle the case where there are multiple frames with the same minimum size. 

Here is an example of how it could be modified:
```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    # Check if all white pixels are on the frame
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w' and (i < top or i > bottom or j < left or j > right):
                return -1
            if screen[i][j] == 'w' and top <= i <= bottom and left <= j <= right and i!= top and i!= bottom and j!= left and j!= right:
                return -1
    return result
```
This modification checks if all white pixels are on the frame by verifying that there are no white pixels outside the frame and that there are no white pixels inside the frame that are not on the border. 

However, this code still does not handle the case where there are multiple frames with the same minimum size. To handle this case, we need to modify the code to generate all possible frames and then select the one with the minimum size. 

Here is a possible implementation:
```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if screen[i][j] == 'w']
    min_size = float('inf')
    result = None
    for size in range(2, n + m):
        for top in range(n - size + 1):
            for left in range(m - size + 1):
                frame = [(i, j) for i in range(top, top + size) for j in range(left, left + size) if i == top or i == top + size - 1 or j == left or j == left + size - 1]
                if set(white_pixels).issubset(set(frame)):
                    if size < min_size:
                        min_size = size
                        result = [list(row) for row in screen]
                        for i in range(top, top + size):
                            for j in range(left, left + size):
                                if i == top or i == top + size - 1 or j == left or j == left + size - 1:
                                    if result[i][j] == '.':
                                        result[i][j] = '+'
    if result is None:
        return -1
    return result
```
This implementation generates all possible frames and checks if all white pixels are on the frame. It selects the frame with the minimum size and returns it. If no frame is found, it returns -1. 

Note that this implementation has a high time complexity due to the generation of all possible frames. It may not be efficient for large inputs.
