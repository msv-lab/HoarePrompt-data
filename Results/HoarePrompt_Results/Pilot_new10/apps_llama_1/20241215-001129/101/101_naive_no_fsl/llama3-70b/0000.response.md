Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be correct and works as expected according to the problem description. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program starts by reading the monitor's resolution (n, m) and the initial state of the monitor pixels.

2. It then finds the positions of all white pixels and calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of these pixels.

3. The size of the frame is calculated as the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates plus 1.

4. If the calculated frame size is larger than the monitor's width or height, the program prints -1, indicating that a valid frame does not exist.

5. Otherwise, the program iterates over all pixels and marks the border pixels of the frame with a '+' character, leaving the white pixels unchanged.

6. Finally, the program prints the updated state of the monitor pixels.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:

- If there are no white pixels, the program will not enter the loop that calculates the frame size and will print the initial state of the monitor pixels.

- If the monitor has only one row or one column, the program will correctly calculate the frame size and print the updated state of the monitor pixels.

- If the calculated frame size is larger than the monitor's width or height, the program will print -1, as expected.

The program also correctly handles the example cases provided in the problem description.

Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the problem description and handles all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
