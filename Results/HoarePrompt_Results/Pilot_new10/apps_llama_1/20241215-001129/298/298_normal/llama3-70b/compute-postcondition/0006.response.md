The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns a tuple of two integers that represent the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. 

If `b` is 0, the function directly returns `(1, 0)`, implying `x = 1` and `y = 0` as a solution to the equation when `b` is 0.

For non-zero `b`, the function uses recursion to find `x` and `y` by calling itself with `b` and `a % b` and then calculates the values of `x` and `y` based on the recursive results.

However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `a` or `b` is negative, or where `a` and `b` are both zero, which could potentially lead to inconsistent or undefined results in these cases.

Upon examining the code line by line, it appears the function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` and express it as a linear combination of `a` and `b`. 

The function does not check for `a` and `b` being both zero, in which case the gcd is undefined. It also does not handle potential overflow issues for large inputs.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple of two integers representing the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, with `x` and `y` calculated based on recursive calls and the specific case handling when `b` is 0, assuming `a` and `b` are non-zero to ensure meaningful results, but does not explicitly handle cases where `a` or `b` is negative, or where both are zero, and does not account for potential overflow issues. **
