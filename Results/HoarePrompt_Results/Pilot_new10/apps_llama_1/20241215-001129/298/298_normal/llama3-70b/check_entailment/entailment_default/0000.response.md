Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly solve the problem description. Here's an explanation of why:

1. The code first checks if the product of `n` and `m` is divisible by `k`. If not, it prints "NO" and exits, which is correct because the area of the triangle should be equal to `nm/k`.

2. If `nm` is divisible by `k`, it calls `func_3(n, m)` to obtain the values `n1`, `m1`, and `g`. Here, `g` is the GCD of `n` and `m`, calculated using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm in `func_2(a, b)`.

3. It then checks if `abs(n1 * m)` is greater than or equal to `g`. If true, it prints "YES" and the coordinates of three points that form a triangle with the desired area.

The key insight here is that the code is using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. This allows it to find the values `n1` and `m1` such that `n1 * m` and `m1 * m` are both multiples of `g`, which is the GCD of `n` and `m`.

The output hints for the functions agree with the code and provide additional context for the calculations. The `func_1(a, b)` is not used in the provided code, but it calculates the GCD of two numbers, which is related to the calculations in `func_2(a, b)` and `func_3(a, b)`.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, the example with input `4 3 3` prints the correct output, and the example with input `4 4 7` prints "NO" because there is no triangle with the desired area.

Overall, the code seems to correctly handle all potential cases, and the output hints agree with the code. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
