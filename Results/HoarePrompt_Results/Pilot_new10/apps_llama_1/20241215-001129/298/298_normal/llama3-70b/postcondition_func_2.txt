The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calls `func_2(a, b)` to obtain `x` and `y`, and returns these values along with the calculated value of `x * a + y * b`, assuming `func_2(a, b)` executes successfully and returns two values; otherwise, its behavior is dependent on the implementation and potential error handling of `func_2(a, b)`.
