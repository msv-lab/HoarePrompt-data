The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. According to the code, the function calculates the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

The annotations state that the function returns the absolute value of the original value of `a`, but the code actually returns the GCD of `a` and `b`. The return postconditions also state that the program returns `a`, which is the absolute value of the original value of `a`, but this is not accurate.

Upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that the function returns `a` after the while loop has been executed, and at this point, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The GCD is always a non-negative number, so the function effectively returns the GCD of the absolute values of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate the GCD of the absolute values of `a` and `b`, not the absolute value of the original value of `a`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the GCD of the absolute values of `a` and `b`. **
