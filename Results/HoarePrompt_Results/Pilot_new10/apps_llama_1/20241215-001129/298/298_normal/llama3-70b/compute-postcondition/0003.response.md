The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and it calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain the values of `x` and `y`. It then returns these values `x` and `y`, along with the calculated value of `x * a + y * b`. 

To understand the complete functionality, we must consider the potential behavior of `func_2(a, b)`, which is not provided in the annotations. However, based on the given information, `func_3` relies on `func_2` to provide `x` and `y`. If `func_2` does not return two values or if it throws an exception, `func_3` will either not work as described or will throw an exception. 

We also need to consider edge cases such as when `a` or `b` are zero or negative, and how `func_2` handles these cases. Since `func_2` is not defined, we cannot determine its behavior with certainty.

Given the information provided, the functionality of `func_3` can be described as follows, keeping in mind the potential for `func_2` to affect the outcome:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calls `func_2(a, b)` to obtain `x` and `y`, and returns these values along with the calculated value of `x * a + y * b`, assuming `func_2(a, b)` executes successfully and returns two values; otherwise, its behavior is dependent on the implementation and potential error handling of `func_2(a, b)`. **
