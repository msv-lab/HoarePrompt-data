The code assigns the return values of `func_2(a, b)` to the variables `x` and `y`. The precondition states that `a` and `b` are integers, which is still valid after the code has been executed. The values of `x` and `y` are now equal to the return values of `func_2(a, b)`, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are unknown because the implementation of `func_2(a, b)` is not provided.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(a, b)`**
