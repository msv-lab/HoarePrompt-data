The code prints 'NO', which does not affect the values of the variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, and the current value of `area` is 0, and 'NO' has been printed**
