The function `func` does not accept any parameters `n`, `m`, or `k` as they are not defined in the function definition. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems that the function is intended to operate on these parameters. Assuming the function is supposed to accept these parameters, we can describe its functionality as follows:

The function `func` is intended to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 10^9 and 2 <= `k` <= 10^9. However, without the actual output or return value description, we cannot determine what the function returns.

Since there is no description of the output or return value, we cannot provide a complete description of the functionality. 

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept parameters n, m, and k, where n, m, and k are integers within specified ranges, but the return value is not defined.**
