Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is the result of `n * m / k`. If `area` is not a whole number, 'NO' has been printed to the console. If `area` is a whole number, then 'YES' has been printed if `area` is not 0, and 'NO' has been printed if `area` is 0. If `area` is a non-zero whole number, '0 0' has been printed. Additionally, the printing of subsequent strings depends on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`: if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `f'{2 * area} 1'` and '0 1' have been printed; if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m` but larger than `n`, then '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area` and '1 0' have been printed; if `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, then '0 0' has been printed twice, `f'{n} {m // 2}'` has been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed twice.**
