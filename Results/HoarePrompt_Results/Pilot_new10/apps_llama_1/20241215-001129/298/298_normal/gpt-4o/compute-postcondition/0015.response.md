Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the current value of `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k` and is not equal to 0. 'YES' has been printed, and '0 0' has been printed. Given that 2 * `area` is larger than `n`, the current value of `2 * area` is also less than or equal to `m`.**
