The code prints the string '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area`. The value of `area` is `n * m / k`, which is an integer and not equal to 0. The value of `2 * area` is larger than `n` and less than or equal to `m`. 

The states of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are not affected by the code. 'YES' has been printed, and '0 0' has been printed. Now, '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, and '1 ` followed by the value of `2 * area` has been printed, where `2 * area` is larger than `n` and less than or equal to `m`.**
