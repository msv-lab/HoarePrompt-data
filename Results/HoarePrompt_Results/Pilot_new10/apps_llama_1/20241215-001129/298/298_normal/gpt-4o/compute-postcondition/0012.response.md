The code snippet is printing a string that contains the value of `2 * area` and the integer `1`. The previous values of the variables are: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to `0`, 'YES' has been printed, and '0 0' has been printed. The value of `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`. 

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` do not change. The code only prints a new string, which does not affect the values of these variables. 

However, a new string has been printed: `f'{2 * area} 1'`, which means that the string containing the value of `2 * area` and the integer `1` has been printed. 

The Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to `0`, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, and the string `f'{2 * area} 1'` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to `0`, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, and the string `f'{2 * area} 1'` has been printed**
