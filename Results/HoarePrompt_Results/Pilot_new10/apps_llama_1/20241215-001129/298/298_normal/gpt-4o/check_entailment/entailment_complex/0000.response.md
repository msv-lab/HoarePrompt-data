Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

One of the main issues is that the program does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the three points that form a triangle with an area equal to `n * m / k`. 

In the case where `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, the program prints `f'{n} {m // 2}'` and `f'0 {m // 2}'`. However, this does not necessarily form a triangle with the correct area. 

Another issue is that the program does not handle all possible cases correctly. For example, when `2 * area` is larger than `m` but not larger than `n`, the program does not provide a correct solution.

Additionally, the program does not verify that the calculated points are within the specified bounds (`0 <= x_i, y_i <= n` and `0 <= y_i <= m`).

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed that considers all possible cases and ensures that the calculated points form a triangle with the correct area and are within the specified bounds. 

Here's an example of how you can improve the function:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area!= int(area) or area == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        print('YES')
        print('0 0')
        if 2 * area <= n:
            print(f'{2 * area} 0')
            print(f'0 1')
        elif 2 * area <= m:
            print(f'0 {2 * area}')
            print(f'1 0')
        else:
            # Handle the case where 2 * area is larger than both n and m
            h = (2 * area)
            b = m
            a = b
            c = 0
            while h <= a:
                h = h - 1
                a = (b * h) / 2
                c = h
            print(f'{c} 0')
            print(f'0 {b}')

```

However, the above solution also doesn't cover all the edge cases that might arise during the execution of the code. Therefore, a more comprehensive and robust approach would be required to solve the problem accurately. 

A simple and more accurate approach can be implemented as follows:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n * m) % k!= 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print('0 0')
    if n >= 2 and m >= 1:
        print(f'1 {m - 1}')
        print(f'2 0')
    elif n >= 1 and m >= 2:
        print(f'0 1')
        print(f'0 {m - 1}')
    else:
        print('NO')
        return

```

However, even the above solution will fail to provide a valid triangle for certain values of n, m, and k.

An alternative solution can use a brute-force approach by checking all possible points within the given bounds and calculating the area of the triangle formed by these points. This approach would be more comprehensive, but it would also be less efficient and may exceed the time limit for large inputs.

To implement a correct solution, a mathematical approach can be used to calculate the coordinates of the points that form a triangle with the desired area. This approach would involve using the formula for the area of a triangle and solving for the coordinates of the points. 

Here's an example of a brute force solution in Python:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area!= int(area) or area == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        for x1 in range(n + 1):
            for y1 in range(m + 1):
                for x2 in range(n + 1):
                    for y2 in range(m + 1):
                        for x3 in range(n + 1):
                            for y3 in range(m + 1):
                                # calculate the area of the triangle
                                A = abs((x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) / 2.0)
                                if A == area:
                                    print('YES')
                                    print(x1, y1)
                                    print(x2, y2)
                                    print(x3, y3)
                                    return
        print('NO')

```
However, this brute-force approach will only work for small inputs and will be inefficient for large inputs due to its O(n^6) time complexity. 

To find an efficient solution, we need to consider the properties of the triangle and the given bounds. 

We can see that if we choose the points (0, 0), (x, 0), and (0, y), the area of the triangle will be xy/2. 

Therefore, we need to find x and y such that xy/2 = n * m / k. 

We can rewrite this equation as xy = 2 * n * m / k. 

We can see that if 2 * n * m / k is not an integer, there will be no solution. 

If 2 * n * m / k is an integer, we can set x = 2 * n * m / (k * y) and y = m. 

However, this will only work if 2 * n * m / (k * y) is less than or equal to n. 

Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of y such that 2 * n * m / (k * y) is less than or equal to n. 

We can see that this maximum value of y is 2 * m / k. 

Therefore, we can set y = min(m, 2 * m / k) and x = 2 * n * m / (k * y). 

Here's an example of an efficient solution in Python:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (2 * n * m) % k!= 0:
        print('NO')
    elif (2 * n * m) // k > n * m:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        y = min(m, 2 * m // k)
        x = (2 * n * m) // (k * y)
        if x > n:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('0 0')
            print(x, '0')
            print('0', y)
```

However, this solution still does not cover all edge cases and may not work for all inputs.

In conclusion, the given program does not always meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and a more comprehensive approach is needed to solve the problem accurately.
