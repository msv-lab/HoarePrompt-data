You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One such case is when `n` is 3, `m` is 4, and `k` is 3. The area of the triangle should be 4, but the program does not find the correct points. 

In this case, the program prints 'YES' and provides the points (0, 0), (2, 1), and (0, 1) for the area of 4. However, these points do not form a triangle with an area of 4.

Another issue is when the area is a fraction, the program immediately returns 'NO', which is correct. However, when the area is an integer, the program tries to find points that form a triangle with that area. But its approach is incorrect.

For example, when `n` is 5, `m` is 5, and `k` is 5, the program returns 'YES' and provides the points (0, 0), (2, 1), and (0, 1), but these points do not form a triangle with an area of 5.

To fix this, we need to reconsider the approach to find the points that form a triangle with the given area. We need to ensure that the points are chosen such that they satisfy the conditions of the problem and actually form a triangle with the required area. 

Here is an alternative approach in Python:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area!= int(area) or area == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        print('YES')
        print('0 0')
        if 2 * area <= n:
            print(f'{2 * area} 0')
            print(f'{area} {m}')
        elif 2 * area <= m:
            print(f'{0} {2 * area}')
            print(f'{n} {area}')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```
This approach still has limitations and might not work for all cases. For instance, it does not consider cases where `n` or `m` is less than or equal to 2, or where the area is not an integer multiple of the base or height of the triangle.

To ensure correctness, we would need to further analyze the problem and consider all possible cases, possibly using a more sophisticated algorithm to find the points that form a triangle with the given area. 

However, as the provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases, its correctness is False.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, and 2 * `area` is larger than `n`. If 2 * `area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 ` followed by the value of `2 * area` has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. Otherwise, '0 0' has been printed twice, `f'{n} {m // 2}'` has been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed twice.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to `0`, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then the string `f'{2 * area} 1'` has been printed and the string '0 1' has been printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area` has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, then '0 0' has been printed twice, `f'{n} {m // 2}'` has been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed twice.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`. If `area` is 0, 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed. Additionally, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then the string `f'{2 * area} 1'` has been printed and the string '0 1' has been printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m` but larger than `n`, then '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area` has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, then '0 0' has been printed twice, `f'{n} {m // 2}'` has been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed twice.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is the result of `n * m / k`. If `area` is not a whole number, 'NO' has been printed to the console. If `area` is a whole number, then 'YES' has been printed if `area` is not 0, and 'NO' has been printed if `area` is 0. If `area` is a non-zero whole number, '0 0' has been printed. Additionally, the printing of subsequent strings depends on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`: if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `f'{2 * area} 1'` and '0 1' have been printed; if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m` but larger than `n`, then '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area` and '1 0' have been printed; if `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, then '0 0' has been printed twice, `f'{n} {m // 2}'` has been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed twice.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` as input, calculates the area as `n * m / k`, and prints 'NO' if the area is not a whole number or is 0. If the area is a non-zero whole number, it prints 'YES', '0 0', and additional coordinates based on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. Specifically, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `f'{2 * area} 1'` and '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m` but larger than `n`, it prints '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area` and '1 0'. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, it prints `f'{n} {m // 2}'` and `f'0 {m // 2}'`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
