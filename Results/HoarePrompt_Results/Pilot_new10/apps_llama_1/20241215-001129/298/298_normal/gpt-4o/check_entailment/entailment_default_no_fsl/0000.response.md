Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The main issue lies in the calculation and handling of the area and the coordinates of the triangle points.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when `n` and `m` are both greater than or equal to `2 * area`, but the program's logic for assigning coordinates is flawed. It only checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`, and if not, it assigns `x_2` and `x_3` as `n` and `0`, and `y_2` and `y_3` as `m // 2` and `m // 2`, which may not form a triangle with the correct area.

Furthermore, the formula for calculating the area of a triangle given three points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)` is `area = 0.5 * abs(x1*(y2 - y3) + x2*(y3 - y1) + x3*(y1 - y2))`. However, the program does not use this formula to verify that the calculated points indeed form a triangle with the required area.

Lastly, the examples provided demonstrate the program's potential to fail. For instance, the example inputs `(4, 3, 3)` work correctly because the program assigns points that indeed form a triangle with the area `4`, but this does not guarantee correctness for all inputs. 

Therefore, due to the potential for incorrect handling of certain cases, the program's correctness is deemed **False**.
