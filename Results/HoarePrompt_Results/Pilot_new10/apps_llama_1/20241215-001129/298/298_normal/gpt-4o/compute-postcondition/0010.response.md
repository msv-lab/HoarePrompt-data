The code prints '0 0'. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are not affected by this code, and 'YES' has been printed before. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, and '0 0' has been printed.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, and '0 0' has been printed**
