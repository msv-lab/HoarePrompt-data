Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One such case is when `n` is 3, `m` is 4, and `k` is 3. The area of the triangle should be 4, but the program does not find the correct points. 

In this case, the program prints 'YES' and provides the points (0, 0), (2, 1), and (0, 1) for the area of 4. However, these points do not form a triangle with an area of 4.

Another issue is when the area is a fraction, the program immediately returns 'NO', which is correct. However, when the area is an integer, the program tries to find points that form a triangle with that area. But its approach is incorrect.

For example, when `n` is 5, `m` is 5, and `k` is 5, the program returns 'YES' and provides the points (0, 0), (2, 1), and (0, 1), but these points do not form a triangle with an area of 5.

To fix this, we need to reconsider the approach to find the points that form a triangle with the given area. We need to ensure that the points are chosen such that they satisfy the conditions of the problem and actually form a triangle with the required area. 

Here is an alternative approach in Python:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area!= int(area) or area == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        print('YES')
        print('0 0')
        if 2 * area <= n:
            print(f'{2 * area} 0')
            print(f'{area} {m}')
        elif 2 * area <= m:
            print(f'{0} {2 * area}')
            print(f'{n} {area}')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```
This approach still has limitations and might not work for all cases. For instance, it does not consider cases where `n` or `m` is less than or equal to 2, or where the area is not an integer multiple of the base or height of the triangle.

To ensure correctness, we would need to further analyze the problem and consider all possible cases, possibly using a more sophisticated algorithm to find the points that form a triangle with the given area. 

However, as the provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases, its correctness is False.
