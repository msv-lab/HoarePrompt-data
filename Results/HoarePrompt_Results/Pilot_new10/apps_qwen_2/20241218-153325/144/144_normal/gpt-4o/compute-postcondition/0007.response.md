Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mex` is 2, and if the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to 1, `mex` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, `mex` stays as 2 regardless of the value of `num` being less than 1.***
