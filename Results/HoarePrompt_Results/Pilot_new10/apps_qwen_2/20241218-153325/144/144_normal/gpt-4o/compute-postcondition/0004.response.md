According to the given for loop, the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The variable `num` will take on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration, but we don't need to adjust its initial state.

Given the conditions:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
- `mex` is 1 (this does not affect the loop's execution directly)

To ensure the loop can execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. Since `n` is defined to be in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers, `a` will always have at least one element if `n` is within this range.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element, which it already does based on the given constraints.

State: **`total` is not relevant here, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mex` is 1**
