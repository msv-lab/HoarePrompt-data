Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of mex. The issue arises in the logic used to determine the mex value. Specifically, the program increments `mex` only when it matches the current number in the sorted array, which is not always the correct approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 2
```

The program sorts the array to `[1, 2, 2]` and then iterates through it. It finds that `1` matches the current `mex` value, so it increments `mex` to `2`. However, the correct mex value should be `3` because Alyona can decrease the second element to `1`, and the array would be `[1, 1, 2]`, making the mex value `3`.

To fix this, the program should keep track of the highest number that has been seen so far and ensure that `mex` is incremented appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = 1
    max_seen = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_seen:
            max_seen = num
        elif num >= mex:
            mex += 1
    print(mex)
```

This corrected version ensures that `mex` is incremented correctly based on the highest number seen so far, which aligns with the problem description.
