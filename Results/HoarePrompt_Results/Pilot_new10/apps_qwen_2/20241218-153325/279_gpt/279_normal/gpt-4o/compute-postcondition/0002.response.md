`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`. The value of `data[0]` is a string obtained from `sys.stdin.read` split into a list of strings. Other variables (`p`, `b`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and all p_i are unique), `b` is a list of n integers consisting of zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`.**
