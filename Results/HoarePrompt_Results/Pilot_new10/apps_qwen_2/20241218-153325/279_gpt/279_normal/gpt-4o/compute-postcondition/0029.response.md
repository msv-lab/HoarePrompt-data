To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given Conditions:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `cycle` is an empty list
- `x` is 1
- The loop condition is `while not visited[x]:`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `visited[x]` is `False`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1 (This value doesn't directly affect the loop condition but might be part of the state context)
   - `n` is an integer in the specified range (This value also doesn't directly affect the loop condition)
   - `cycle` is an empty list (This might indicate the start of processing but doesn't affect the loop directly)
   - `x` is 1 (This is the key variable for the loop condition)

For the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` must be `False`. Since `x` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `visited[1]` is `False`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `visited[1]` is `False`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1, and `visited[1]` is False**
