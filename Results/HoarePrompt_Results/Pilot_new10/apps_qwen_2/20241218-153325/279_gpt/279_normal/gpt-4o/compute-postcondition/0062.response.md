Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited` is a list where each element is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the corresponding index was part of any cycle, `cycles` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a cycle found in the graph represented by `p`, and `p` and `b` are lists of integers as originally defined.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each `i`, if `visited[i]` is `False`, it starts a new cycle.
- It marks the nodes in the cycle by setting `visited[x]` to `True` and appends them to `cycle`.
- The loop continues until it reaches a node that has already been visited.
- After completing a cycle, it appends the cycle to `cycles`.
- If `visited[i]` is `True` when the loop checks it, it skips further processing for that `i`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- Every node in the graph (represented by the indices `0` to `n-1`) will have been checked for cycles.
- Nodes that are part of cycles will have `visited` marked as `True`.
- The `cycles` list will contain all cycles found in the graph, each represented as a list of indices.
- The original lists `p` and `b` remain unchanged.

This ensures that after the loop completes, we have identified all cycles in the graph and updated the `visited` list accordingly.
