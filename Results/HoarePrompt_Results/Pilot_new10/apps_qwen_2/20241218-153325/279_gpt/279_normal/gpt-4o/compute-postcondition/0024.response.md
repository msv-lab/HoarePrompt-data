The code appends the `cycle` list to the `cycles` list. The `cycle` list contains all nodes in the cycle starting from 0 up to the last node visited, and `x` is the last node visited before the loop exits. The append operation does not change the value of `x` or the contents of `visited` or `n`. Therefore, the only change is that `cycle` is added to `cycles`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains all nodes in the cycle starting from 0 up to the last node visited, `x` is the last node visited before the loop exits, `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list**
