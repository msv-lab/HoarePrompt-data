`cycles.append(cycle)` appends the current value of `cycle` to the list `cycles`. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `visited[x]`, or `x`. The `not visited[i]` condition remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[x]` is True, `cycle` contains all elements that were added during the loop execution, `x` is the final value obtained by following the path defined by `p`, `not visited[i]` is initially True and remains True, `cycles` now includes the current `cycle`**
