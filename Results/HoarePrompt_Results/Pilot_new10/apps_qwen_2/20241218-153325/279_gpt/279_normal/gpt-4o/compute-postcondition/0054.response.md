The code `x = p[x] - 1` updates the value of `x` to `p[x] - 1`. Given the initial state where `visited[x]` is True, `visited[p[2] - 1]` is False, and `cycle` contains `x`, the value of `x` is updated, but the truth value of `visited[x]` remains True unless `x` changes in such a way that it maps to a different index in `visited` which is not specified here.

Therefore, the only variable that changes is `x`, and its new value is `p[x] - 1`.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is True, `visited[p[2] - 1]` is False, `cycle` contains `x`, `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
