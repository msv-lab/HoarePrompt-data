The code updates `new_b` based on the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Given that `candidate` is a factor of `diff` and `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, the value of `candidate` is valid for the calculation. We need to determine the new value of `new_b`.

Since `b` is given as `b`, let's denote its value as `b_value`. The expression for `new_b` can be broken down as follows:

1. Calculate `(b_value + candidate - 1) // candidate`: This expression performs integer division after adding `candidate - 1` to `b_value`.
2. Multiply the result by `candidate` to get the final value of `new_b`.

Given that `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, and assuming `candidate` is a specific integer, the expression `(b_value + candidate - 1) // candidate` will result in an integer value. Multiplying this integer by `candidate` will give us `new_b`.

Let's assume `candidate` is `c` and `b_value` is `b`:

- `(b + c - 1) // c` simplifies to an integer `q`.
- `new_b = q * c`.

Since `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, and without loss of generality, we can assume `candidate` is known and specific.

Therefore, the updated value of `new_b` is:

\[ new_b = \left(\frac{b + c - 1}{c}\right) \times c \]

Simplifying further:

\[ new_b = b + c - 1 \]

So, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is `a + candidate - 1`, `b` is `b`, `diff` is `diff`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, and `new_b` is `b + candidate - 1`.**
