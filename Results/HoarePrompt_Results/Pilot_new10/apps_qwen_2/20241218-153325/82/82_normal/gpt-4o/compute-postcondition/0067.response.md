The code updates the value of `new_a` to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). Here, `candidate` can be either `k` or `diff // k`. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `candidate` is `k`, then `new_a` becomes \((a + k - 1) // k * k\).
2. If `candidate` is `diff // k`, then `new_a` becomes \((a + (diff // k) - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)\).

Since the exact value of `candidate` is not specified, we will consider both scenarios.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`; `k` is a positive integer; `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) where `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`; `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged unless updated by subsequent code.**
