`new_a` is assigned the value `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. This operation updates the value of `a` to the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `b`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `(b + new_candidate + (diff // k) - 2) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is `min(current_lcm, min_lcm)` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `(diff // k) < min_k`), and `min_k` is `min((diff // k), min_k)` if the conditions are met.**
