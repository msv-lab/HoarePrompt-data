The code calculates `new_b` as the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. The calculation is done using the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

- `new_b` is assigned the value `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- This means `new_b` is rounded up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

Since `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), and `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `new_b` will be updated according to the given formula.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `a` remains the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value.
- `b` is replaced by `new_b`.
- `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1.
- `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.
- `min_lcm` is the least common multiple based on the first candidate `k`.
- `min_k` remains the candidate based on the first candidate `k`.
- `new_a` remains the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value; `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\); `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1; `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`; `min_lcm` is the least common multiple based on the first candidate `k`; `min_k` is the candidate based on the first candidate `k`; `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
