The code `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` calls a function `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are already defined as per the initial state, and the function call does not affect the values of the other variables. The function `func_2` returns a value, which is assigned to `current_lcm`. However, since the actual implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is a positive integer, and `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
