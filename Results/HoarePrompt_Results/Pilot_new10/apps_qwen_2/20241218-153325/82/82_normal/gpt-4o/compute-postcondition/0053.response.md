The code sets `min_k` to the value of `candidate`. This directly updates the value of `min_k`. The other variables remain in their previous states. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `b` is \(b + new_candidate - 1\)
- `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`
- `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`
- `min_k` is `candidate`

Output State: **`a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `candidate`**
