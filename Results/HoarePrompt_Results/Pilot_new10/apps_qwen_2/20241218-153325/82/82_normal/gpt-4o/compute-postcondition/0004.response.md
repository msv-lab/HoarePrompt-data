The code initializes `min_lcm` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `diff`. The only change is that `min_lcm` now has a specific value.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\); `min_lcm` is infinity**
