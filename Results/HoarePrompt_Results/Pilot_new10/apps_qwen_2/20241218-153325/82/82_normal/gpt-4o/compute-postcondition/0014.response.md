The code `min_k = candidate` simply assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. This does not change the values of any other variables and keeps the conditions and relationships of the initial state intact.

Output State: **`a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value, `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is now equal to `candidate`, and `candidate` is less than `min_k` if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm`.**
