Postcondition: **`a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `candidate` is unchanged; `new_a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1; `new_b` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b` and is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
