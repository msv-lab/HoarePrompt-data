Postcondition: **`a` is an integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\) and must be at least 1, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0, the loop iterates from `k = 1` to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, and the condition `diff % k == 0` is true for the current value of `k`.**
