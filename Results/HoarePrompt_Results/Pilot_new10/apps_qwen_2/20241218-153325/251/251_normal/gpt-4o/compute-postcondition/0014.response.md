Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples `(r_i, h_i)`, `volumes` is a list of volumes calculated as \( \pi \times r_i^2 \times h_i \) for each cake, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element is `volumes[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` such that `j < i` and `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`.**
