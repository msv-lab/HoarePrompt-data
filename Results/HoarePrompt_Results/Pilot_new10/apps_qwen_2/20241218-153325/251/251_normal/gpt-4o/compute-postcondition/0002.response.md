The code creates a new list `cakes` where each element is a tuple containing the radius and height of a cake. The tuples are constructed from elements in the `data` list, which is split into integers.

Given the Initial State:
- `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`
- `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple (r_i, h_i) represents the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.

The code iterates over the range of `n`, and for each index `i` in this range, it constructs a tuple `(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2]))` and appends it to the list `cakes`.

Since `data` is already split into strings, the code directly converts these strings to integers to form the tuples. After this operation, `cakes` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the radius and height of a cake.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by converting `int(data[2 * i + 1])` and `int(data[2 * i + 2])` to integers for each `i` in range `n`.**
