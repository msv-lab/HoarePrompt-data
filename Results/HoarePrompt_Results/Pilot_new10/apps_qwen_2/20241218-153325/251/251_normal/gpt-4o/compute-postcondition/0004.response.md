The code snippet provided is printing the value of `result` with 6 decimal places. The value of `result` is obtained from the function call `func_1(n, cakes)`. However, the function `func_1` itself is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. The only thing we know is that `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`.

Therefore, the only variable that changes its state is `result`, which is printed with 6 decimal places. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by converting `int(data[2 * i + 1])` and `int(data[2 * i + 2])` to integers for each `i` in range `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)` and it is printed with 6 decimal places.**
