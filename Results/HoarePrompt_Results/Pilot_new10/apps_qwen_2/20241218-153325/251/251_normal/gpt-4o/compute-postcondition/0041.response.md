Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples `(r_i, h_i)`, `volumes` is a list of volumes calculated as \( \pi \times r_i^2 \times h_i \) for each cake, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value between its original value (which is `volumes[i]`) and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` in the range 0 to `i-1` where `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`.**
