The code snippet `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])` impacts the values of `dp[i]`, specifically `dp[3]`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` itself is not directly used in this snippet)
- `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`
- `dp[2]` is updated to either `cakes[2][0]` or the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[2][0]` for some valid `j`
- `dp[3]` is updated to the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for some valid `j`

Given the snippet, `dp[3]` is being updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for some valid `j`. Since `j` is not specified, we consider the general case where `j` could be 1 or 2.

The output state after the code executes is:

- `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`
- `dp[2]` remains as the value determined from the previous condition (either `cakes[2][0]` or the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[2][0]` for some valid `j`)
- `dp[3]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for some valid `j` (specifically, it will be the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for `j` being 1 or 2)

Output State: **`dp[1]` is `max_value_1`, `dp[2]` is the maximum value of `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]` or `dp[2] + cakes[2][0]`, `dp[3]` is the maximum value between `dp[3]` and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for some valid `j` (where `j` can be 1 or 2)**
