Postcondition: ***`i` is 1 and `j` is 1. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[1]` is either `dp_initial` or `dp_initial + cake_value`, depending on which is larger. Otherwise, the condition is not met and no changes are made to `dp[1]`.***
