`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `visited_count` is 2, so it will become 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_leaves` is 2; `visited_count` is 3; `path` is the remaining part of the original path (two characters shorter); `current_level` is 1; `current_node` is either 3 or 4 depending on the value of `direction`; if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is either 3 or 5; otherwise, `current_node` is either 4 or 6 depending on the first character of the original `path`.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2; `visited_count` is 3; `path` is the remaining part of the original path (two characters shorter); `current_level` is 1; `current_node` is either 3 or 4 depending on the value of `direction`; if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is either 3 or 5; otherwise, `current_node` is either 4 or 6 depending on the first character of the original `path`.**
