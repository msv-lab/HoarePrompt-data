The code updates `current_node` to `2 * current_node + 1`. Given that `current_node` is either 3 or 4 depending on the value of `direction`, let's consider both cases:

1. If `direction` is such that `current_node` is 3:
   - `current_node` becomes `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.

2. If `direction` is such that `current_node` is 4:
   - `current_node` becomes `2 * 4 + 1 = 9`.

The other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2; `visited_count` is 3; `path` is the remaining part of the original path (two characters shorter); `current_level` is 1; `current_node` is either 7 or 9 depending on the value of `direction`.**
