To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program carefully.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We want to remove the least number of digits from `n` such that the resulting number is divisible by \(10^k\).
2. The resulting number must have exactly `k` zeros at the end, thus we only care about the last `k` digits after removing unnecessary digits.
3. The output should be the number of digits removed to achieve a number that meets these criteria.

### Program Logic:
1. The program takes input values of `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes `count_zeros` to count the zeros found at the end of the reversed number and `to_remove` to count the non-zero digits removed.
3. It iterates over the digits of `n` in reverse:
   - Counts the zeros and once `k` zeros have been found, it stops counting further.
   - For every digit that is not a zero, it increments the `to_remove` counter.
4. If `count_zeros` equals `k` after the loop, it prints the number of non-zero digits removed (`to_remove`).
5. If `count_zeros` is less than `k`, it defaults to print the total length of `n` minus one (`len(n) - 1`).

### Potential Issue:
The program has a potential problem in handling certain input cases. For instance:
- If the number is `1000000000` and `k = 9`, the requirement is to retain 9 zeros. However, since there is a single non-zero digit (`1`), it would remove it entirely and give an output of `1`. This is incorrect, as the minimum digits to remove should allow to keep `0` with no leading zeros, and the correct output should be `1` since keeping `0` (or retaining it) does not violate the leading zero restriction.

### Other Test Cases:
- For `n = 30020` and `k = 3`, the program does produce `1`, which is correct since it can retain `3000`.
- For `n = 100` and `k = 2`, the output of `2` is again correct, as it can retain just `0`.
- For `n = 10203049` and `k = 2`, the program correctly identifies it needs to remove 3 digits to get to `0` for divisibility.

Despite the cases that seem to be handled correctly, the edge case where too few zeros are found causing an incorrect calculation of digits to remove shows a flaw in the logic. 

### Conclusion:
Therefore, since I found a case where the program does not behave correctly according to the problem specifications:

Correctness: **False** 

The default case handles with `len(n) - 1` may lead to incorrect results when `n` must have `k` zeros at the end, and we should retain trailing zeros even in cases where we most likely keep leading zeros constraints in mind.
