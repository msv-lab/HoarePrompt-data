The variable `to_remove` is assigned the value of `0`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `count_zeros` remain unaffected as they are not modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9; `count_zeros` is 0; `to_remove` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9; `count_zeros` is 0; `to_remove` is 0.**
