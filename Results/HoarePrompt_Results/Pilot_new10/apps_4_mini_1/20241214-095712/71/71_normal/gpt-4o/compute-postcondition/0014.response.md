The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer in the range from 0 to 2,000,000,000, and `to_remove` remains unchanged, the output state contains all relevant information. The value of `count_zeros` will now reflect the new count after the increment. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000; `to_remove` remains unchanged; `count_zeros` is incremented by 1.**
