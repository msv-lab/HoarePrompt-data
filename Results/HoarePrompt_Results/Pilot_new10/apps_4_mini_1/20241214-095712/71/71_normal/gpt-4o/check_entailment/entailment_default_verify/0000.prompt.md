You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break down what the program is trying to achieve.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Given a number `n` and an integer `k`, we need to determine the minimum number of digits to be deleted from `n` to make it divisible by `10^k`.
2. The result should not have unnecessary leading zeros (except for the single case where the result must be '0').

### Program Review:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. The program reads `n` as a string for easy digit manipulation.
2. It counts trailing zeros (from the end) and other digits to delete. It stops when it has counted `k` zeros.
3. If `k` zeros are found, it prints the count of other digits that should be removed to achieve this. If not enough zeros are found, it prints the length of `n` minus one, which may indicate that every digit should be removed except one.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program does not handle cases where there might be too few zeros in `n`. 
2. If `n` has exactly `k` zeros but none at the correct position to maintain the structure of a valid number, the program logic may not return the correct count of deletions.
3. For large values of `n` where there are no trailing zeros (e.g., `n = 123456789` and `k = 1`), the program may erroneously print `len(n) - 1`, suggesting removing all but one digit, which does not guarantee the resulting number matches the stated divisibility requirement if the zero is never actually present.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
n = 123450  (has only two trailing zeros which isn't enough for k=3)
k = 3
```
The program would incorrectly attempt to keep `12345` (by calculating `to_remove`) and return `5`, which does not meet the requirement to make something divisible by `10^3` because not enough zeros can be retained.

### Conclusion:
Given the review and potential edge cases where the program provides incorrect outputs, the program does not correctly implement the logic described, leading to failures in some scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts no parameters and reads two values from input: a non-negative integer `n` (as a string) and a positive integer `k`. It counts the number of zeros in `n` from the right until it reaches `k` zeros or there are no more zeros. If it counts exactly `k` zeros, it prints the number of non-zero digits encountered before reaching those zeros. If it encounters fewer than `k` zeros, it prints the length of `n` minus one. Edge cases include inputs with no zeros or inputs with fewer than `k` zeros, which result in different output values based on the conditions outlined. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
