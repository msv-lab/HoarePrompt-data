Postcondition: ***`count_zeros` is equal to the total number of zeros in `n`, `to_remove` is the count of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` zeros, and `n` remains a string representation of the original non-negative integer. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then `to_remove` has been printed. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is less than `k`, and `len(n) - 1` has been printed.***
