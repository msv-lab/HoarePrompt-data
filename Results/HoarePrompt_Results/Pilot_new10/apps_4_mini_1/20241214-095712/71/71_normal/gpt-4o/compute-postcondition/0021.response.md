The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n`, `digit`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000; `digit` is the next digit in the reversed string representation of `n`; `count_zeros` is equal to `k`; `to_remove` has been increased by 1.**
