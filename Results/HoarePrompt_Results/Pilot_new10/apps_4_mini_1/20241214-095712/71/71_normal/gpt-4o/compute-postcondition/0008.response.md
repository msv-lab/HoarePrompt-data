The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `to_remove` is not provided, and it could be any integer. The other variables are not affected, so we retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `digit` is the last character of `n`, and `digit` is not '0'; `to_remove` is increased by 1.**
