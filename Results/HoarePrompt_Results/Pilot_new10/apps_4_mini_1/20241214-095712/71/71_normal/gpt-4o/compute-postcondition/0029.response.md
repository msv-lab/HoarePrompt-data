The code `print(len(n) - 1)` calculates the length of the string `n`, which represents the original non-negative integer, and then subtracts 1 from this length. The value of `len(n)` is the total number of digits in `n`. The variables `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`count_zeros` is equal to the total number of zeros in `n` and is less than `k`, `to_remove` is equal to the count of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` zeros, the length of `n` is the total number of digits in `n`, and the result of `len(n) - 1` is printed.**
