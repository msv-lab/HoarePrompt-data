The function accepts no parameters and reads two values from input: a non-negative integer `n` (as a string) and a positive integer `k`. It counts the number of zeros in `n` from the right until it reaches `k` zeros or there are no more zeros. If it counts exactly `k` zeros, it prints the number of non-zero digits encountered before reaching those zeros. If it encounters fewer than `k` zeros, it prints the length of `n` minus one. Edge cases include inputs with no zeros or inputs with fewer than `k` zeros, which result in different output values based on the conditions outlined.
