The variable `k` is assigned the value of `int(k)`, converting it from a string representation to its integer equivalent. The value of `k` is originally a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 9\), so after conversion, `k` will be an integer within the same range. The variable `n` remains unchanged and still holds a string representation of a non-negative integer within the specified limits.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.**
