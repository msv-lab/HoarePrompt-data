The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop where we were processing the digits of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000; `count_zeros` has not been incremented, and `to_remove` has not been incremented because we are breaking out of the current loop or if statement without further processing. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000; `count_zeros` remains unchanged; `to_remove` remains unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
