According to the code, the loop iterates over the digits of the string representation of `n` in reverse order. Each iteration processes one digit. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still the same string representation of the non-negative integer, and `to_remove` remains unchanged under the conditions given. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that we have at least one more digit to process. 

Since the digits are being accessed in reverse, if the length of `n` is `m`, the next iteration would handle the next digit from the end. Given that `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, we would still be able to proceed with the next digit unless all digits have been processed. 

Thus, if `n` has `m` digits, to execute one more time, we need to verify that `m` is greater than the number of iterations that have already been executed. If we can safely access the next digit (which would be at index `m - i - 1` if `i` is the current iteration count), then we can continue.

If the last complete iteration accessed the last digit (when `i` was `m - 1`), to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Let's denote that the last iterated digit in the loop was the last digit of `n`.

Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, we would set `i` to `m` (if it was `m - 1`) or increase it appropriately, and ensure that we are ready to access the next digit.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000, `to_remove` remains unchanged, and the loop index is incremented to the next digit's position.**
