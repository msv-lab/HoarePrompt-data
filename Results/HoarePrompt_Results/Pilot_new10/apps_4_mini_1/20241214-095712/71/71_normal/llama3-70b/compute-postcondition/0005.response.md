To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition `n % 10 ** k != 0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-zero integer that is not divisible by 10. This means that `n` currently satisfies the loop condition. Since `n` has been reduced to its integer division by 10 in the last iteration, its new value, say `n'`, is such that:

- `n' = n // 10`, and since `n` is not divisible by 10, `n'` will also not be divisible by 10 if `n >= 10`. 

The next condition we need to evaluate is whether `n' % 10 ** k != 0`. The current state of `k` is not specified, but since we know that `n` is still a non-zero integer not divisible by 10, it guarantees that for the next iteration, the condition will likely still hold true unless `n'` equals zero or becomes divisible by `10 ** k`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we should ensure that `n'` remains a non-zero integer and not divisible by `10` after the division. Since `n` starts as a non-zero integer not divisible by 10 and `w` is merely incremented by 1, we do not need to adjust `w` as it remains valid for the next iteration.

Therefore, we re-evaluate `n'`:
- It must remain non-zero and not divisible by 10 after the integer division. 

Given that the last `n` was not divisible by 10, we can say:
- The state can remain the same where `n` needs to be ensured that its integer result `n'` (after being reduced) still meets the criteria of not being zero and not divisible by 10.

State: **`n` must not equal 0 after integer division and remain not divisible by 10, `w` is increased by 1**
