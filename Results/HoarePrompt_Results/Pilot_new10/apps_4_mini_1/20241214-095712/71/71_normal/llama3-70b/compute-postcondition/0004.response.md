The line of code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by `10`, effectively reducing `n` to its quotient when divided by `10`. Since it is stated that `n` must not be divisible by `10`, it implies that after this operation, `n` will be less than its original value but will retain the potential to be a non-zero integer.

The variable `w` is also noted to be increased by 1, which means `w` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state.

Thus, the output state after executing the code is that `n` is still a non-zero integer, now reduced by a factor of 10 (assuming the original value is greater than 10), and `w` is incremented. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-zero integer that is not divisible by 10 and is now reduced to its integer division by 10; `w` is increased by 1**.
