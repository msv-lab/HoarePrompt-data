The value of `w` is incremented by 1. Since there are no constraints or specific previous values given for `w`, the output state will reflect that `w` has increased by 1. The conditions about `n` remain valid as no operations involving `n` have taken place.

Output State: **`n` must not equal 0 after integer division and remain not divisible by 10; `w` is increased by 1**
