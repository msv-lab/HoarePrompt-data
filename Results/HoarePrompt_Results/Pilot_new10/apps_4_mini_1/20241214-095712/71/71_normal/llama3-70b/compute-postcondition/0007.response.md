The value of `n` is modified by integer division by 10. Given that `n` must not be 0 after this operation, the new value of `n` becomes `n // 10`, which is guaranteed to be an integer value not equal to 0. The variable `w` is stated to be increased by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must not equal 0 after integer division and remain not divisible by 10; `w` is increased by 1; `n` is now `n // 10`.**
