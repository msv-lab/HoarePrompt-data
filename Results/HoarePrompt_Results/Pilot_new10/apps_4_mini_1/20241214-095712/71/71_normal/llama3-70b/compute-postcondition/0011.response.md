After analyzing the loop execution step by step, we can derive the output state based on the conditions and transformations that occur during each iteration of the while loop.

1. The loop continues executing as long as `n % (10 ** k) != 0`. Thus, it only stops when the last `k` digits of `n` are all zeros.
2. Each iteration of the loop divides `n` by 10 (integer division), effectively removing the last digit of `n`, while incrementing `w` by 1 each time to count how many digits were removed before reaching a number that is divisible by `10 ** k`.

Given this understanding, let's summarize the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed:

- The loop will terminate when the last `k` digits of `n` are zeros. Hence, at termination, `n` will be an integer that is divisible by `10 ** k`.
- The value of `w` will represent how many times `n` was divided by 10, effectively indicating how many trailing non-zero digits were present originally in `n`.

Thus, we can conclude:

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is divisible by `10 ** k`, `w` is the number of trailing non-zero digits that were originally present in `n`.**
