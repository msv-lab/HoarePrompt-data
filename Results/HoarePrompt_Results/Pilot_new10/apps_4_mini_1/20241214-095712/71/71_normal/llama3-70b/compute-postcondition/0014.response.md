Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters: a non-negative integer `n` (between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive) and a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 9 inclusive). It counts the number of digits that need to be removed from the right end of `n` until `n` becomes divisible by `10^k`, and it prints this count. If `n` is already divisible by `10^k` at the start, it returns 0 without removing any digits. **
