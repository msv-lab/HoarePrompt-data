The `print(w)` statement attempts to output the value of `w`, but there is no prior definition or assignment to the variable `w` in the initial state or code snippet provided. The variable `w` is not related to `n`, which is stated to be an integer divisible by `10`. Therefore, since `w` is undefined, attempting to print it would typically result in a `NameError`.

The output state reflects the fact that `w` is referenced but not defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is divisible by `10`, `w` is not defined (resulting in NameError)**
