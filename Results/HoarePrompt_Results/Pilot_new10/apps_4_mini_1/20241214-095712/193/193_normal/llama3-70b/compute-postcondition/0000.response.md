The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new integer values where both values are taken from the input and converted using the `map(int, input().split())` logic. The condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000` still holds true, but the specific values for `x` and `y` are now determined by the input provided, which is not specified in the initial state. Thus, they are now equal to the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`x` is equal to an input integer and `y` is equal to an input integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
