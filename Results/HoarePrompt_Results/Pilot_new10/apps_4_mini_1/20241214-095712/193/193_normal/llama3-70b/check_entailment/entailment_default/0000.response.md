The program provided calculates the absolute difference between the two integer inputs `x` and `y`. However, the problem description specifies that Memory can only modify the sides of the triangle while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., it must still form a valid triangle).

To transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` to one with side length `y`, the program fails to consider the necessary operations required to perform this transformation while adhering to the non-degenerate triangle condition. For example, the number of seconds required is not simply the absolute difference, as modifications may need to occur sequentially and carefully to ensure that the triangle remains valid (especially since all sides of an equilateral triangle need to be equal).

The provided examples clarify that the minimum operations needed can result in different counts than just `abs(x - y)`:

1. From `(6, 6, 6)` to `(3, 3, 3)` takes 4 seconds.
2. From `(8, 8, 8)` to `(5, 5, 5)` takes 3 seconds.
3. From `(22, 22, 22)` to `(4, 4, 4)` takes more than the simple difference.

These cases show that the program miscalculates the number of operations required to modify the triangle sides correctly.

Thus, the program is inadequate since it does not consider how to maintain the non-degenerate nature of the triangle while transitioning from `x` to `y`.

Correctness: **False**.
