The function `func` does not accept any parameters as per the provided definition. However, given the specified constraints, it operates with two integers `x` and `y`, where it is ensured that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. Although the function does not directly receive these parameters as inputs, it appears to use them in its processing.

The output behavior is undefined in the given context, as the function does not specify what it returns. 

Given that the constraints on `x` and `y` suggest potential operations involving comparisons or calculations within the defined range, it is necessary to formulate a meaningful description based on common assumptions for functions defined in such a manner.

However, there are no explicit return outputs provided to clarify the functionality. Therefore, I will state the function's parameters as constraints and leave the return value ambiguous.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters explicitly, but operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is not specified.**
