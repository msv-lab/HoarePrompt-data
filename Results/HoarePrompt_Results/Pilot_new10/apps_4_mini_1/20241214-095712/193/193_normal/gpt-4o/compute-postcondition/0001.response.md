To analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet:

Initial State: `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000; x is an input integer; y is an input integer.`
The code computes a value based on the difference between `x` and `y`:
```
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```
Here, `(x - y) // 2` computes the integer division of the difference between `x` and `y` by 2, while `(x - y) % 2` computes the remainder of that difference when divided by 2. Together, these calculations ensure a clear breakdown of changes made based on the difference between `x` and `y`.

Let’s denote `d = x - y`, then the expression simplifies to:
```
print(d // 2 + d % 2)
```
This expression is equivalently adding to half the difference (`d // 2`) and whether there is an additional "left over" since the difference could be odd (`d % 2` adds 1 in the case that `d` is odd).

Since `x` and `y` are both input integers, the output directly results from the calculation based on their values. The values of `x` and `y` are not updated; rather, we are calculating and printing a new value.

The output thus reflects that the values of `x` and `y` were not modified, and the result will depend on the specific inputs chosen for these integers. Hence, after executing the code, we acknowledge the computed value without changing the underlying constraints.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000; x is an input integer; y is an input integer; output is (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2.**
