The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. Based on the output description, the function does not provide any return value specified in the provided information. Therefore, it seems that the function doesn't return any output as per the given constraints and relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, both integers within the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000, but does not return any output.**
