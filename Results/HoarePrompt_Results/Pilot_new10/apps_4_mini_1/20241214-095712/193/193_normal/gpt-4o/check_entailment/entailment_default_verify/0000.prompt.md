You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the program:

The program outlines a function designed to determine the minimum number of seconds required to modify the sides of an equilateral triangle of length `x` to a shorter length `y`. 

Examining the logic in the function:
```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Step-by-step Evaluation:
1. **Understanding of Triangle Properties**:
   - The initial triangle has sides (x, x, x).
   - To convert it to (y, y, y), the lengths need to decrease, and adjustments must maintain a non-degenerate triangle (which is satisfied since x > y).

2. **Operations**:
   - Every second, the code proposes to reduce the length by modifying one of the sides.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` divides the total difference `(x - y)` by 2 and accounts for any remaining single unit that cannot be paired (using the modulus operator). This seems to calculate the number of operations needed.

### Potential Incorrect Case:
Let's consider a case where the difference between `x` and `y` may lead to different interpretations or inaccuracies:
- If `x = 7` and `y = 4`, the calculations would be:
  - `(7 - 4) // 2 + (7 - 4) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  
  However, the correct minimum steps would be to reduce from:
  ```
  (7, 7, 7) -> (4, 7, 7) -> (4, 4, 7) -> (4, 4, 4)
  ```
  This clearly takes 3 steps, demonstrating that the function miscalculates the minimum number of seconds required as 2. 

Thus, there is a discrepancy showing that the program does not capture all cases correctly based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 
The function does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle sides from `x` to `y` for all possible inputs, particularly in cases where the difference is odd and less straightforward.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers, `x` and `y`, within the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000, and calculates and prints the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. However, it does not return any output or value to the caller. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
