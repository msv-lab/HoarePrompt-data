Correctness: **False**.

The provided program simply computes the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. However, it does not account for the requirement that the transformation must maintain the characteristics of an equilateral triangle while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate throughout the process. The problem specifies that each side modification must result in a valid triangle with positive area, and the triangle must remain equilateral until all sides reach the length `y`.

For example, consider the input `(6, 3)`. The program will output `3`, which is incorrect. The steps needed are:

1. Change one side from 6 to 3 (making it a non-degenerate triangle for a moment).
2. Change the other sides down to 3 while ensuring at no point does any side length go below 3 until all sides are 3.

The sequence must follow a valid path regarding the rules of triangle lengths, and the minimum number of steps is actually `4`, as shown in the examples above. Hence, the logic in the program does not reflect the requirements of the task correctly.
