Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program fails to handle the case where there are multiple parts of the array needed to satisfy the condition of non-zero sums. Specifically, it assumes that if the total sum is not zero, it can simply return the whole array as one part. However, this does not account for the fact that parts can have individual sums of zero, which would not satisfy the requirement.

For example, consider the input where the array contains multiple elements that sum to zero in subsets:

Input:
```
5
1 1 -2 0 0
```

The total sum is `0`, but if we analyze the array, it can indeed be split into parts that do not sum to zero, for instance:

- The first part `1 1` sums to `2` (non-zero),
- The second part `-2` sums to `-2` (non-zero),
- The last part `0 0` sums to `0`, which is not allowed.

However, the program would print "NO" for this input due to the total being zero, which makes it incorrect. 

Thus, there are cases where the program's logic is insufficient to determine valid partitions correctly, leading to an overall conclusion of incorrectness.
