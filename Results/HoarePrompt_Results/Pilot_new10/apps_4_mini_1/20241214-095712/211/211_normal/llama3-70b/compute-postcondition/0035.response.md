The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `A`. The integer `n` must be between 1 and 100, and the list `A` must contain `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is in the range of -1000 to 1000. The function processes these inputs and produces a result based on them.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (between 1 and 100) and a list A (with n integers in the range of -1000 to 1000).**
