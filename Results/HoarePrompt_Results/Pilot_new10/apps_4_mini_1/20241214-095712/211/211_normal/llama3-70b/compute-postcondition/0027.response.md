To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider how the loop operates and the variable changes.

According to the code, the loop runs based on the variable `r`, which starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. The current state indicates that `r` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, so for the loop to execute again, `r` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `r` must still be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is initially between 1 and 100, for the loop to run again, we update the state accordingly:

At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `r` will become 3. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. Thus, we maintain the condition on `n` and update `r`.

State: **`n` is between 3 and 100, `k` is set to 3, `l` is set to 2, `r` is 3, and the output printed is 2 1 2**.
