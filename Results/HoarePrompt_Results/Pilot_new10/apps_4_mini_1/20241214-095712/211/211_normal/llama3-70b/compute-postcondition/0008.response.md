The code updates the `prefix_sum` list. Specifically, it computes `prefix_sum[i + 1]` as the sum of `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]`. Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, and `n` can range from 1 to 100, this operation will update the `prefix_sum` at position `n + 1` based on the last element of `a` at index `n`.

Given that the list `A` has been filled with integers from input and that `a` is equal to `A`, it follows that:
- `prefix_sum[n + 1]` will now hold the value `prefix_sum[n] + a[n]`, where `a[n]` will be the `n`-th integer from the input list.

The rest of the variables maintain their existing values. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is `n`, `A` is a list of length `n` containing integers from input, `a` is equal to `A`, and `prefix_sum[n + 1] = prefix_sum[n] + a[n]`.**
