The variable `prefix_sum` is assigned a list containing `n + 1` zeros. The length of this list is determined by the value of `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100. Other variables (`A` and `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, if `n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` will be a list containing `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `A` is a list of length `n` containing the integers from input; `a` is equal to `A`; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros.**
