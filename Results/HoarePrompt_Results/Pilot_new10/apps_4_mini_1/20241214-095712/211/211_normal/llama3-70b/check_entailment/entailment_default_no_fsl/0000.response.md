Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem. 

1. The primary condition that each of the new arrays must have a non-zero sum is not guaranteed by the logic in the code. The program only checks if the total sum of the array is zero to decide on a straightforward "NO" output. However, there are situations where the total sum can be non-zero, yet it is impossible to split the array into non-zero sums due to the arrangement of numbers.

2. For example, consider the input `5` followed by `2 -2 1 -1 0`. The total sum is `0`, thus the program would output "NO". However, the input can actually be split into subarrays: `2 -2` and `1 -1 0`, both of which yield non-zero sums for each subarray. 

3. The output hints suggest that it checks only for prefix sums that are non-zero but does not ensure that the resulting subarrays formed from prefix sums will always yield non-zero sums. 

Due to this oversight, there are cases where the sum of elements can be rearranged to avoid zero subarrays, which the code does not accommodate correctly. Therefore, the assessment for correctness is falseâ€”it does not hold for every potential case as specified in the problem description.
