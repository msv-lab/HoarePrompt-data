Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100. If `prefix_sum[n]` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `k` is equal to the count of valid `r` values plus 1, or 1 if no valid `r` values exist. `l` takes the last valid `r` value, or remains 1 if no such `r` values exist, and `r` is finally set to `n`.***
