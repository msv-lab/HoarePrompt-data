You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's break down the logic used in the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first takes an integer `n` which is the number of elements in the array `A`, and then it reads the array `A` itself.

2. **Calculating the Total Sum**: The total sum of the elements in array `A` is computed. If the total sum is not zero, the program outputs "YES", and indicates that the entire array can be taken as one valid subarray (from `1` to `n`).

3. **Checking for Non-Zero Elements**: If the total sum is zero, the program checks each element of the array for a non-zero value. When it finds a non-zero value at index `i`, it outputs "YES", splits the array into two parts: one part from the start to index `i` and the next from index `i + 1` to the end of the array.

4. **Handling All Zeros**: If all elements in the array are zero, the program prints "NO".

**Analysis of Edge Cases**:
- If the array consists of all zeros (e.g., `0`, `0`, `0`), the output should correctly be "NO", which the program handles well.
- If the total sum is zero but includes positive and negative numbers in such a way that there's at least one non-zero element, the program handles it appropriately by creating two subarrays.
- However, the program only checks for the first non-zero element and splits the array based on that, which can lead to incorrect results if the remaining elements after that point sum to zero. 

**Example of an Input the Program Handles Incorrectly**:
Consider the following input:
```
5
1 -1 2 -2 0
```
- The total sum is `0`, so the program will look for non-zero elements.
- It finds `1` at index `1` and will split the array as `1` and `-1 2 -2 0`. The second subarray `-1 2 -2 0` sums to `-1` which is non-zero but not guaranteed that all parts have non-zero sums unless we split correctly.
- A better split could have been `1` and `-1 2 -2` where both parts are maintained as valid, hence no violations occur here.

The main flaw here is that it might not comprehensively check other potential splits for valid sums if the total is zero.

Thus, the program will fail in scenarios where the splits might not strictly maintain valid subarray sums. 

Therefore, based on the above analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if (total_sum != 0) :
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`. The printed output is 'NO' indicating all elements in A are zero.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; if `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' and '1' are printed, followed by the values of `1` and `n`. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed, indicating that all elements in `A` are zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100`) and a list `A` of `n` integers (each between -1000 and 1000). It calculates the sum of the elements in `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints 'YES', followed by '1' and the values '1' and `n`. If the sum is zero, it checks each element in `A`; if it finds a non-zero element at index `i`, it prints 'YES', followed by '2', then prints '1' and `i + 1`, and finally prints `i + 2` and `n`. If all elements in `A` are zero, it prints 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
