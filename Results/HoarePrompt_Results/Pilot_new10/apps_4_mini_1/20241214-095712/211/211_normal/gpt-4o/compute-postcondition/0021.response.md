The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 1; printed output is '3 n', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
