To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem asks for the minimum number of skewer turning actions needed to turn all skewers from `1` to `n`, considering that turning skewer `i` affects `k` skewers to the left and `k` skewers to the right. 

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the input values `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers affected on each side when one is turned).
2. Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `positions` to store the indices of the skewers that will be turned.
3. It uses a loop to increment the index `i` by `2 * k + 1` for each iteration, and appends `i` to the list `positions` as long as `i` is within bounds (i.e., `i <= n`).
4. Finally, it prints the count of positions and the respective skewer indices in `positions`.

Let's consider some examples:

1. For `n = 7` and `k = 2`:
   - Expected output: Turn skewer `1` (affects `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`) and then `6` (affects `5, 6, 7`), done in `2` operations.
   - Actual output from the program: It will turn `1` and `6`, resulting in the desired output. 

2. For `n = 5` and `k = 1`:
   - Expected output: Turn over skewer `1` (affects `1, 2, 3`) and then `4` (affects `4, 5`), done in `2` operations.
   - Actual output from the program: It will also print `1` and `4`, also resulting in the desired output.

Now, let’s consider a case where the program might fail:
- If `k = 0`, turning any skewer only affects itself. Thus, to turn all skewers, Miroslav would need to turn each skewer individually.
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 0`, the expected output is:
     - Turn `1` (affects `1`), `2` (affects `2`), `3` (affects `3`), and `4` (affects `4`) → 4 operations in total, with outputs `1, 2, 3, 4`.
   - However, the program incorrectly computes that only `positions.append(i)` is sufficient, producing indices `1` and `3` with `2` operations instead, missing to turn skewers `2` and `4`.

Given this case where the program fails, we conclude that it does not fulfill the requirement for every potential case, specifically when `k = 0`.

Correctness: **False**.
