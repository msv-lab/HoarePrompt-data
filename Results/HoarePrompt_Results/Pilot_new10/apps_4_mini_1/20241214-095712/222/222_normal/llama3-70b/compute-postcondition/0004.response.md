`res` is a list that will have a new element appended to it, which is computed based on the current values of `i` and `k`. The expression `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` will be evaluated, where `i` is currently `0`. Thus, the result of the expression will be `0 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = 1`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `l` is equal to (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `i` is 0; `res` now contains 1.**
