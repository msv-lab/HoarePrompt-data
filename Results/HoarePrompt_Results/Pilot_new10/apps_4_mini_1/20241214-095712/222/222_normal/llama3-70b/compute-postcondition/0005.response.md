According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `l`. The loop continues while `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, meaning `i` becomes 1.

We need to consider the calculation of `l`. Given `n` must be at least `k + 2`, the value of `l` is defined as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. 

To ascertain the conditions for the loop to run another iteration:
- Since `i` is currently 0 and will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, we need `l` to be at least 2 for the loop to have a condition to execute. This requires that the given formula for `l` aligns with `i` becoming 2 for the next potential execution.

Hence, to have the loop execute again, `n` and `k` must ensure that `l` is at least 2. 

State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `l` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `res` now contains 1**
