According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `l` and the variable `i`. The loop can execute if `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` must be at least 2. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2), and we must ensure that `l` is at least 3 to allow `i` to be less than `l`. 

Thus, we update the state as follows:
- `i` becomes 2,
- `l` must be at least 3 to allow for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `l` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `res` now contains 1 and (k * 2 + 2)**
