The variable `l` is assigned the value of `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. The values of `n` and `k` are integers as per user input, where `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`. Therefore, the value of `l` will be calculated as the integer division of `(n + k - 1)` by `(k * 2 + 1)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= 1000; `l` is equal to (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)**
