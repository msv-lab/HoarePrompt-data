You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it fulfills the problem's requirements in all potential cases.

The problem requires that Miroslav turns over all skewers while minimizing the number of actions. Each action on skewer `i` will affect `k` skewers on either side of `i`, in addition to `i` itself, totaling to `2k + 1` skewers affected per action.

Key points:
1. The program calculates the minimum number of actions `l` required to turn all skewers based on the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula seems correct for determining how many full groups of `2k + 1` skewers are needed to cover `n` skewers.
   
2. In the subsequent loop, it generates the indexes of the skewers to turn over. It does this by iterating `l` times and appending the skewer index `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.

Now, to see if the program is correct:

- Let's take the case where `k = 0`. This means turning one skewer affects only that specific skewer. For any `n`, the program's logic would yield `l = n` because each action would only turn over one skewer. The output would be the sequence `1, 2, ..., n`, which would indeed turn all skewers over.

- For a more complex example, let’s consider `n = 8` and `k = 2`. The calculated `l` would be `(8 + 2 - 1) // (2*2 + 1) = 3`. That means three actions are executed, affecting groups of `5` skewers each time. The program would propose turning skewer indexes `1`, `6`. However, for this case to be validated:
  - Turning skewer `1` would affect skewers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
  - Turning skewer `6` would affect skewers `5, 6, 7, 8`.
  Hence, all skewers will indeed be turned over.

- Other test cases can similarly be validated, showing the steps reflect correct outputs as described.

However, let’s consider the edge case:
- If `n` is less than or equal to `2k + 1`, the program only needs one action, but it may not necessarily return the optimal first skewer to turn. In fact, this could miss potential optimal solutions, especially with low `k`.

Ultimately, while the logic used seems mathematically sound, it can fail to provide an optimal skewer sequence to minimize turns, particularly when there are remaining skewer configurations to address. Thus upon consideration of cases:

Correctness: **False**
There exists the potential case for skewers being left untouched or not optimally covered within the structural logic of the provided program when viewed under broader constraints of `k`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `l` is equal to (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` contains a list of length `l` with elements being 1, (k * 2 + 2), (4k + 3), ..., (i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1) for each `i` in the range from 0 to `l-1`.
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
