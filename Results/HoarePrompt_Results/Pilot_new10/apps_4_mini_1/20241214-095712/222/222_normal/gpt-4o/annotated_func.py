#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of skewers, and k is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)) representing the number of skewers turned over from each side in one action.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `positions` contains m values which are `1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), 1 + 2 * (2 * k + 1), ..., 1 + (m - 1) * (2 * k + 1)` where `1 + m * (2 * k + 1) > n`, `i` is `1 + m * (2 * k + 1)`, and there are `m` iterations where `m` is the largest integer such that `1 + m * (2 * k + 1) <= n`.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of skewers and a non-negative integer `k` indicating how many skewers are turned over from each side in one action. It generates a list of positions based on the formula starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` until the next position exceeds `n`. It prints the count of positions and the positions themselves. The function does not return a value; it only outputs results to the console. Additionally, it does not return `0` or `2 * k + 1` as stated in the annotations, and it lacks functionality for handling cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
