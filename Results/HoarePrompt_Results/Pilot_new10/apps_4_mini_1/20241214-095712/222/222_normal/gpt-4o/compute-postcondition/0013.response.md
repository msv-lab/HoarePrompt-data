The code prints the values in `positions` as a string joined by spaces. The variables `positions`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged after the execution of the print statement. Therefore, the present state of these variables is still relevant.

Output State: **`positions` contains `m` values, `i` is `1 + m * (2 * k + 1)`, and the length printed is `m`.**
