Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not ensure that all skewers are turned over correctly based on the problem description. The key issues are as follows:

1. **Positions Calculation**: The function uses the formula `i += 2 * k + 1` to determine which skewers to turn over. This formula is intended to skip over the skewers that have been turned over. However, it does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned, especially when `k` is smaller relative to `n`. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 1`, the positions calculated would be [1, 4], which does not turn over skewers 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.

2. **Handling Cases Where `k` is Larger or Equal to `n`**: The comments mention a lack of functionality for cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` were equal to or larger than `n`, the program should ideally turn all skewers in one step, but it would fail to handle that situation correctly.

3. **Output Representation**: While the program prints the count of positions and the positions themselves, it does not output the skewers in a way that guarantees all skewers are flipped over in the minimal number of actions, according to the requirements of the problem.

Since the program does not account for these scenarios and does not perform as required under various inputs, it does not meet the problem's requirements. Thus, the result is marked as incorrect.
