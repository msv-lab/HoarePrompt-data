The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Initially, `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`. After the increment, the new value of `i` will be:

\[ i = (4 * k + 3) + (2 * k + 1) = 6 * k + 4 \]

The other variables `n` and `positions` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` must be at least `4 * k + 3`, `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3], `i` is equal to `6 * k + 4`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `4 * k + 3`, `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3], `i` is equal to `6 * k + 4**
