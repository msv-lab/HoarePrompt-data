The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer, constrained to the range of 1 to 1000, representing the number of skewers. The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer, constrained to the range of 0 to the minimum of (n-1) and 1000, representing the number of skewers turned over from each side in one action. 

The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k` as follows:

Case 1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `0`.

Case 2: If `k` is less than `n`, the function returns the value of `2 * k + 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and it returns `0` if `k` is equal to or greater than `n`, or `2 * k + 1` if `k` is less than `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer representing the number of skewers) and `k` (a non-negative integer representing the number of skewers turned over in one action) and returns `0` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, it returns `2 * k + 1`.**
