The variable `i` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `positions` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)), `positions` is an empty list, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)), `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 1**.
