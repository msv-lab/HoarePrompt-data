Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately concludes that the program's correctness is **True**. The problem description requires the program to compute the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use based on the specified ratios of 1 lemon: 2 apples: 4 pears.

The annotated version of the code clearly outlines that:
- The program correctly takes positive integers for `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
- It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the constraints posed by the available quantities of apples and pears.
- The computation correctly applies the ratios to derive the total number of fruits used.

The function adheres to all the necessary conditions set forth in the problem description and can handle scenarios where Nikolay may not have enough to make even a single compote (it returns 0 in that case). The explanation provided reflects the program's logic and how it meets the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment remains valid, and the program's correctness is supported by both the problem description and the annotated code's state.
