The provided program is responsible for calculating the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to cook a compote following the specified ratio of lemons, apples, and pears (1:2:4). 

Upon analyzing the logic in the code:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

The program computes `min_lemon` as the minimum of the number of lemons available (`a`), half the number of apples available (`b // 2` since 2 apples are needed for each lemon), and one-fourth the number of pears available (`c // 4` since 4 pears are needed for each lemon). It then calculates the total number of fruits used as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `7 * min_lemon`.

Let us consider the potential edge cases:

1. **When the number of lemons is low compared to apples and pears**:
   - Input: 2 (lemons), 5 (apples), 7 (pears)
   - Correct output: 7 (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears) using 1 lemon.
   - The program correctly computes this.

2. **When there is an adequate amount of apples and pears to use more lemons**:
   - Input: 4 (lemons), 7 (apples), 13 (pears)
   - Correct output: 21 (3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears) using 3 lemons.
   - The program computes this correctly as well.

3. **When there are not enough pears**:
   - Input: 2 (lemons), 3 (apples), 2 (pears)
   - Correct output: 0 (you cannot make even one serving as there are not enough pears).
   - The method calculates `min_lemon` as 0 (since `c // 4` will be 0) and prints 0 correctly.

Given these analysis points, it appears that the program incapsulates the requirement put forth by the problem description and accounts for all possible cases correctly.

Thus, based on the examples and logic given, the function behaves as expected, and therefore:

Correctness: **True**.
