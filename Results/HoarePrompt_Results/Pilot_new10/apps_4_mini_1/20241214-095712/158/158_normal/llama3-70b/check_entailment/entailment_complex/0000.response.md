To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
Nikolay wants to create a compote with a fixed fruit ratio:
- 1 lemon for every 2 apples
- 4 pears for every lemon

The total fruit requirement can be summarized as:
- If using `x` lemons, we need:
  - `x` lemons
  - `2x` apples
  - `4x` pears

From the available fruits:
- Lemons available: `a`
- Apples available: `b`
- Pears available: `c`

### Objective
We need to calculate the maximum total number of fruits used in the compote that still adheres to the specified ratio. The output should be the total number of fruits used.

### Analyzing the Program
Let's break down the provided program:

1. It takes three positive integers from input:
   - `a` (lemons)
   - `b` (apples)
   - `c` (pears)

2. It calculates `min_lemon`, which is derived from:
   ```python
   min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
   ```
   This expression effectively determines the maximum feasible lemons (`x`), ensuring:
   - It does not exceed the actual number of lemons (`a`).
   - It does not exceed the available apples divided by 2 (each lemon requires 2 apples).
   - It does not exceed the available pears divided by 4 (each lemon requires 4 pears).

3. Finally, it calculates and prints the total number of fruits used:
   ```python
   print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
   ```
   This calculates the total as:
   \[
   \text{Total} = x + 2x + 4x = 7x
   \]

### Correctness Check
The logic implemented in the program adheres to the constraints described in the problem and effectively calculates the maximum possible total of fruits that can be used while maintaining the specified ratio of lemon to apples to pears.

- The calculation of `min_lemon` correctly ensures that we only utilize the available number of each fruit in accordance with the required ratios.
- When `min_lemon` is zero (if not enough fruits are available in the respective proportions), the output will also correctly reflect that no fruits can be used (outputting 0).

### Conclusion
Since the program reliably implements the requirements as specified in the problem description and correctly handles all potential input cases according to the provided constraints, the output will always correctly reflect the possible maximum total number of fruits that can be used.

Correctness: **True**
