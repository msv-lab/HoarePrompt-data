The function `func` does not accept any parameters based on the provided definition. Therefore, it does not work with any input values. The output behavior of the function is not specified in the given output description. Thus, without knowing what the function does or returns, I cannot provide a specific functionality statement.

Given the initial information about the parameters that could be represented as `a`, `b`, and `c`, but stating that there are none defined in the function, the functionality cannot detail any operations or returns. 

If more details about the return or behavior of the function were provided in the form of outputs based on inputs, I could draw conclusions about the functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and the output behavior is unspecified.**
