Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It calculates the number of complete sets of the fruit ratio (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) that can be made based on the available quantities of each fruit. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code works:
1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used by calculating the minimum of:
   - the available lemons `a`, 
   - half the available apples `b // 2`, 
   - a quarter of the available pears `c // 4`.
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used based on this number of complete sets (`min_lemon`) by applying the ratios in the problem statement: 
   - total = `min_lemon` + `min_lemon * 2` + `min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.
4. Finally, it prints the total.

The function correctly handles cases where there are insufficient fruits to make even one complete set, as indicated in the provided examples. Thus, in all possible input combinations within the given constraints, the program meets the specifications of the problem description.
