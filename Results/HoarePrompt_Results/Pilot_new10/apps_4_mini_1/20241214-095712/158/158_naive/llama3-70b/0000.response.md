To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we analyze the logic implemented in the code.

The program reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears, and calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used to prepare the compote. The required ratio is:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

The essential logic employed in the program is:
1. `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` - This calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be utilized, constrained by the amounts of lemons, apples (doubled to account for the ratio), and pears (quadrupled).
2. The output then calculates the total count of fruits used based on this `min_lemon`.

Let's examine some potential cases that could arise with the fruit counts:

1. **Case 1**: Input where `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`:
   - Expected output should be `0` because we cannot satisfy the recipe's requirements.
   - The program would calculate `min_lemon` as `0` since `1 // 2 = 0` and `1 // 4 = 0`, producing an output of `0`. This is correct.

2. **Case 2**: Input where `a = 2, b = 5, c = 7`:
   - Expected output is `7`, as you can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as `1`, leading to an output of `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. This is correct.

3. **Case 3**: Input where `a = 4, b = 7, c = 13`:
   - Expected output should be `21`, using 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as `3`, producing `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`. This is correct.

4. **Case 4**: Input where `a = 2, b = 3, c = 2`:
   - Expected output should be `0`, as there are not enough pears to satisfy the recipe.
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as `0` since `c // 4 = 0`, resulting in an output of `0`. This is correct.

After analyzing these cases (including edge cases), the logic of the program adheres to the requirements for all specified scenarios in the problem description.

Given that all tests are producing expected results, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program consistently calculates the maximum total number of whole fruits that can be used to make the compote according to the specified ratio, handling edge cases appropriately.
