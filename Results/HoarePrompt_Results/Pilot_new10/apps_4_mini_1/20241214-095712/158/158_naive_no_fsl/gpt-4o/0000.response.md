Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it handles the input:

1. It reads the numbers of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) from the input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of the available lemons (`a`), half the apples (`b // 2`), and a quarter of the pears (`c // 4`). This accurately respects the required ratios of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
3. The total number of fruits used in the compote is then computed based on the maximum number of lemons determined.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

The program correctly handles all possible edge cases as described in the problem. For example:
- If no combination of fruits can meet the required ratio (like in the case of `2, 3, 2` where not enough pears are present), it correctly outputs `0`.
- It handles cases where the total number of fruits can be maximized correctly by calculating the best combination according to the defined ratios.

Since all test cases, including those provided in the examples, work correctly according to the problem requirements, there are no potential cases where the program fails.

Overall, I can confirm that the implementation is correct for the specified problem.
