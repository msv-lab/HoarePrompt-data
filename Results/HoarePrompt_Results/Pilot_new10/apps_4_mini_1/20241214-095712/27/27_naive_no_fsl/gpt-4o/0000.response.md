Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple expressions yield the same maximum value. According to the problem description, if there are multiple maximums, it should print the expression that comes first in the list. However, the use of `max()` function in Python with the default behavior will return the first maximum value it encounters, which is not guaranteed to respect the original order of expressions if they are equal.

For example, consider the case if the inputs are `2.0 4.0 2.0`. The expressions will produce `16.0` from both `x^z^y` and `(y^z)^x` since `2^2^4 = 16` and `4^2^2 = 16`. In this case, the program might not reliably return `x^z^y`, which comes earlier in the list, especially if the order of equivalent maximums has specific constraints from the calculations of other expressions. 

Thus, since the implementation doesn't guarantee to output the earliest occurrence of the maximum expression correctly, the correctness of the program cannot be ensured for all cases.
