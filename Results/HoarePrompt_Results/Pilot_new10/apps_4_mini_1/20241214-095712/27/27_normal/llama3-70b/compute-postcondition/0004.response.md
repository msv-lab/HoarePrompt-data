The variable `a4` is assigned the value of `(x ** z) ** y`. The variable `x` is equal to the first input floating point value, `y` is equal to the second input floating point value, and `z` is equal to the third input floating point value. Therefore, `a4` becomes `(x ** z) ** y`, which is equivalent to `x ** (z * y)` by the rules of exponentiation. The values of `a1` and `a3` are unchanged as they are simply equal to `x`. 

Output State: **`x` is equal to the first input floating point value, `y` is equal to the second input floating point value, `z` is equal to the third input floating point value, `a1` is equal to `x`, `a3` is equal to `x`, `a4` is equal to `x ** (z * y)`**.
