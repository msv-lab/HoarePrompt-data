Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where multiple expressions yield the same maximum value. According to the problem description, if there are many maximums, the program should print the one that comes first in the list. However, the implementation incorrectly uses the built-in `max()` function, which does not ensure that it will return the first occurrence when there are ties based on the maximum value. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2.0 3.0 2.0
```
In this case, both `y^z^x` (which equals `3^2^2 = 9`) and `x^z^y` (which also equals `2^2^3 = 8`) yield maximal results, but due to the order of computation, the program may return `y^z^x` as it appears earlier in the given expressions list. Thereby, there is a potential issue where the algorithm does not guarantee to return the first maximum expression's representation in case of ties. 

Thus we have found a case where the program does not adhere to the requirement, making it incorrect.
