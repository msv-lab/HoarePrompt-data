Correctness: **True**. 

The provided implementation computes all twelve specified expressions using the input values `x`, `y`, and `z`. It correctly finds the maximum of these values and retrieves the index of the corresponding expression to ensure it meets the requirement of returning the first occurrence in case of ties. The program handles the required input format, ensuring the output matches the expected structure as described in the problem statement. Since no edge cases or inconsistencies can be identified based on the function's logic and its adherence to the problem description, the program is verified to be correct for all valid inputs.
