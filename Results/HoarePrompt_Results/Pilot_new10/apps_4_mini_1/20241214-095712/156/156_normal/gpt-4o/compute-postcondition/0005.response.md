To analyze the given code snippet, we have the initial state and we will evaluate the impact of the code.

Initial State: `n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m and `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1); `full_rows` is assigned the value `k // (m - 1)`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
```

Analyzing the code:
- The variable `remaining_steps` is assigned the result of `k % (m - 1)`.
- The value of `k` is known to be a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k < n·m), and `m - 1` is a positive integer since `m` is at least `2`.
- Therefore, the value of `remaining_steps` will be the remainder of `k` when divided by `(m - 1)`.

The other states of the variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`) remain unchanged after the execution of this statement.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m and `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1); `full_rows` is assigned the value `k // (m - 1); `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`.**
