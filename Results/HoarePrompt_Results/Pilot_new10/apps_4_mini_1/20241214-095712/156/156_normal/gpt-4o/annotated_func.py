#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m. If `full_rows` is even, then `full_rows` is assigned the value of `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `full_rows` is calculated as before, but `col` is assigned the value equal to `m - remaining_steps` instead.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are even integers within the range of 2 to 10^9. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function outputs `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, `k` is in the range from 0 to less than `n·m`, `full_rows` is computed as `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`, leading to the calculation of `row` as `n - full_rows`, and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is even, or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd, and the values of `row` and `col` are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two even integers `n` and `m` (where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k < n·m). It calculates and prints the position in the grid defined by these parameters. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, it computes how many full rows are completed and the remaining steps to determine the specific row and column in which the position falls, with row calculated as `n - full_rows` and column depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. This results in different column values based on the parity of `full_rows`. The function does not return a value; it directly prints the calculated position.
