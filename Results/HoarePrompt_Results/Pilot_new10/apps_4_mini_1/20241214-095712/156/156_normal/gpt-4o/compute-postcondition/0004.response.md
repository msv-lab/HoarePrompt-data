The variable `full_rows` is assigned the value of `k // (m - 1)`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer within the bounds specified and `m` is an even integer where `m > 1`, the result `k // (m - 1)` will yield an integer value representing the number of full rows that can be formed with `k` using `m - 1` as the width. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not altered, and they maintain their respective definitions as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m and `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1); `full_rows` is assigned the value `k // (m - 1)`.**
