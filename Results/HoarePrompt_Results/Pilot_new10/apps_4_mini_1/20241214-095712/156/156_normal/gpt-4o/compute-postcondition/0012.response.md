Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m. If `full_rows` is even, then `full_rows` is assigned the value of `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `full_rows` is calculated as before, but `col` is assigned the value equal to `m - remaining_steps` instead.***
