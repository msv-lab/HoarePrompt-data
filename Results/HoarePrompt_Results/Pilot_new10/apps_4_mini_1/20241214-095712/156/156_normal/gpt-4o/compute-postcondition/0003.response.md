The code modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `n - 1` from it. Since `k` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `n - 1` (as per the initial state), this subtraction results in a non-negative value for `k`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `m`) remain the same. Thus, the output state can be articulated as follows:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m and `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`.**
