The function accepts three integers: `n` (an even integer between 2 and 10^9), `m` (an integer between 2 and 10^9), and `k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ `k` < `n * m`). It modifies the value of `k` to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and prints a pair of integers based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it calculates and prints two specific values based on `k`. If `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `(1, 2)`.
