The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on user input, specifically from the split input converted to integers. The ranges for `n` and `m` are provided as 2 to 10^9, where `n` is always even. The variable `k` is constrained to be a non-negative integer that is less than the product of `n` and `m`. 

After the execution of the code:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated to the integers provided by the user via input.
- No other variables are affected.

The output state will reflect the new values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as integers that satisfy the provided constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ `k` < `n * m`.**
