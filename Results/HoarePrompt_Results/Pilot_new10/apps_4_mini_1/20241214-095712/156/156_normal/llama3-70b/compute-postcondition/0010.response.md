Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ `k` < `n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the output is `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, given that `0 â‰¤ k < n * 2 - 2`, if `k < n * 2 - 2`, the first printed value is calculated as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and the second printed value is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2`, the values (1, 2) are printed.***
