The variable `s` is assigned the value returned by the `input()` function, which accepts user input. The states of the variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation, and they retain their original constraints. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of balloons (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `k` is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100), `s` is an input string.**
