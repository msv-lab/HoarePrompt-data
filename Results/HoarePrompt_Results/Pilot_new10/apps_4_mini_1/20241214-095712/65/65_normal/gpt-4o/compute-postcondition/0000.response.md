The variables `n` and `k` are assigned new integer values from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes in a string input of two numbers separated by spaces, converting them to integers. The previous conditions that `n` is between 1 and 100 and `k` is also between 1 and 100 still hold true after the assignment. As the specific values are input-dependent, it is impossible to determine exact values for `n` and `k`. Therefore, the output state recognizes that `n` and `k` are now assigned integer values from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of balloons (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `k` is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100)**
