Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a string `s` of lowercase letters representing the colors of `n` balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in `s` and checks whether it is possible to evenly distribute the balloons among `k` friends, given that no friend should receive more balloons of the same color than available. The function prints 'YES' if distribution is possible and 'NO' otherwise. It assumes that no input validation is performed on the values of `n` and `k`.**
