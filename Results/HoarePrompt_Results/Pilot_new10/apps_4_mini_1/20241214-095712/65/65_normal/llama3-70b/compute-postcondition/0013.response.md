According to the code, the loop iteration depends on the string `s`. The loop will execute for each character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the second character of the string `s`, and since the string has at least 2 characters, the index of `c` is 1. The next character in the string `s` will be accessed for the next iteration.

To execute one more time, the loop must process the third character of `s`, which means `c` should now be the third character in the string. Therefore, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`n` is the input integer representing the number of balloons, `k` is the input integer representing the number of friends, `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, and `c` is the third character in `s`.**
