Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer representing the number of balloons, `k` is the input integer representing the number of friends, `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, and `c` is the first character in `s`. If `c` is already a key in `color_count`, the count of `c` in `color_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` is added as a key in `color_count` with a value of 1.***
