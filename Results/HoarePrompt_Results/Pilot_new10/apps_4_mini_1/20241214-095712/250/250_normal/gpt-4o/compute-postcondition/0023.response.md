The variable `x_found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third element of `marks`, and `x_found` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third element of `marks`, `x_found` is True**.
