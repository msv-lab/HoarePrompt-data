Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, and the current value of `mark` is the second element of `marks`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there are no actions taken since there is no else part.***
