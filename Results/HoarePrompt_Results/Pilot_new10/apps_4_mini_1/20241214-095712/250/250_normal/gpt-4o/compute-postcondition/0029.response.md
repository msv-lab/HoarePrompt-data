To analyze the final output state after the loop has completed, we consider the following:

The loop iterates through each `mark` in the `marks` list. During each iteration, it checks if either `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, setting `x_found` to True if either condition is met. Similarly, it checks if either `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in `marks_set`, which sets `y_found` to True.

The loop can terminate early if both `x_found` and `y_found` become True at any point during iterations. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, then `x_found` and `y_found` may be either True or False depending on the elements in `marks`.

Considering that the initial values of `x_found` and `y_found` are both False, and no additional modifications occur if the conditions for setting them are not met, the following states arise:

- If the loop executes, it will go through all elements of `marks`, examining each one until either both conditions are satisfied or all elements are processed.
- The output state will indicate that whether both variables were found or not and will conclude based on the whole list of `marks`.

The list `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, ensuring at least one iteration is performed.

Final output based on the values and the conditions:
Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is True if there exists any `mark` such that `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is True if there exists any `mark` such that `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.**
