The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional structure that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third element of `marks`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
