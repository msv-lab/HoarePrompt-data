Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` has at least one more element, if `not x_found`, then if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains `mark + x`; otherwise, if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`; if `x_found` is true, no changes are made to `new_marks`; `new_marks` now includes `mark + y`.**
