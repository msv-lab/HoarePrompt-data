According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the `marks` list. If the list has more elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the current value of `mark` is the second element of `marks`, so the loop has already processed one element (the first element). Since the loop iterates over each `mark`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `mark` must take the value of the third element of `marks`, and the total number of elements in `marks` must be at least 3. 

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, and the current value of `mark` is the third element of `marks**.
