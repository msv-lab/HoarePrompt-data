Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, and `marks` has at least one more element. If `not y_found` and `not x_found`, `new_marks` contains both `mark + x` and `mark + y` if `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` exists in `marks_set`. If not, but if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains `mark - x` and `mark + y`. If `x_found` is true, no changes are made to `new_marks`. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - y`; otherwise, if `x_found` is true, no changes are made to `new_marks. If `y_found` is true, no changes are made.***
