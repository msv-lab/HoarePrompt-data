Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, and `mark` is the third element of `marks`. If `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is set to True.***
