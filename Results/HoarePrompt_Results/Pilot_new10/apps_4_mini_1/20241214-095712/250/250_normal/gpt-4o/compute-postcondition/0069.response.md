Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` has at least one more element, and `mark` is the next element in the `marks` collection. If `x` has not been found, then if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, the element `mark + x` is added to `new_marks`. If not, and if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, the element `mark - x` is added to `new_marks`.***
