The code prints the values of `x` and `y` contained in the `result` list. The values of `result` remain unchanged, but the action of printing affects what is displayed or outputted.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is empty, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `result` contains both `x` and `y`, and the printed output is the string representation of `x` and `y` joined by a space.**
