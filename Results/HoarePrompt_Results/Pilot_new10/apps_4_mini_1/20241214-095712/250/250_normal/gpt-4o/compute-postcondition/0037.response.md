In the provided code, `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. Since `mark` is defined as the first integer in the `marks` list and `x` is a positive integer, the value `mark + x` will be an integer greater than `mark`. As a result, `new_marks` will no longer be empty after execution. The states of all other variables remain unchanged except for `new_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` now contains the value `mark + x`, and `mark` is the first integer in the `marks` list.**
