According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `marks`. Since `marks` is specified as a non-empty list of integers, it will allow the loop to start executing. The loop iterates over each element in `marks`, and there are no additional conditions that need to be satisfied for the loop to run based on the state before the loop.

At the start of the loop:
1. The variable `mark` is set to the first element in `marks` since it will iterate over the list.
2. The status of `x_found` and `y_found` is relevant for the logic inside the loop but does not prevent the loop from executing.

Hence, for the loop to be executed, the following states must be considered:
- `marks` is a non-empty list of integers (already confirmed from the initial state).
- `mark` is now the first integer in the `marks` list.

The status of `x_found` and `y_found` can be either `False` or `True`, and it does not affect the ability for the loop to run at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, either `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (or both), `new_marks` is an empty set, `mark` is the first integer in the marks list**.
