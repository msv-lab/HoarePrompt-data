Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, either `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False (or both), `new_marks` is an empty set, and `mark` is the first integer in the `marks` list. The current state indicates that `x_found` is still False. Additionally, either `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`.***
