The code `result.append(y)` adds the value of `y` to the `result` list. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `new_marks`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unaffected by this operation. However, the `result` list is updated to include the value of `y`. 

Since `result` initially contains `[x]`, after appending `y`, it will contain `[x, y]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is empty, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `result` is a list containing `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is empty, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `result` is a list containing `x` and `y`.**
