The variables `need_x` and `need_y` are being assigned the values `False`. Since those are the only variables affected by the code, the states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output will reflect that `need_x` and `need_y` have both been set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a set of unique integers from user input, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False**
