The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`, but it is already `True` according to the initial state. Therefore, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, and the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`.**
