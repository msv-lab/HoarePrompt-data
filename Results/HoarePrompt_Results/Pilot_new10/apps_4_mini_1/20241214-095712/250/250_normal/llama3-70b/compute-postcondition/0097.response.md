According to the code, the loop iterates over the `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute again, there needs to be another element in `additional_marks` after the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements, and `j` is set to the first element in that list. 

If the loop is to execute one more time, the next value of `j` must be the second element in the `additional_marks` list. Consequently, the size of `additional_marks` must remain at least 2 so that there can be a second element to trigger the next iteration. 

However, the specific values of `i`, `n`, and the status of `marks` do not change, as they are not affected by the loop iteration over `additional_marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`.**
