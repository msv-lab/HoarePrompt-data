According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least 3 elements, `j` should be updated to the third element in `additional_marks`, and `i` remains unchanged as it refers to the current state from the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`.**
