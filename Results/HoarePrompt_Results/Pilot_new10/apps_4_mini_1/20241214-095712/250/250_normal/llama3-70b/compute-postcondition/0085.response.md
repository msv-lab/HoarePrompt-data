According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` iterable. If there are more elements in `additional_marks`, the loop executes one more time for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current element in `marks`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` is non-empty, it contains at least one element currently in the loop. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we must increment `j` to the next valid element in `additional_marks`. Consequently, `additional_marks` will still contain the previous elements plus the new element `i + j`, provided that `i + j` remains less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`. 

Thus, the adjusted state will maintain the values but advance `j` to represent the next element of `additional_marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains the original elements plus the next element `i + j`, where `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` (after the first valid element)**
