Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least one element (specifically `y`), `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. The sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l`, and the value of `i + j` is not an element in `marks`.***
