The code adds the sum of `i` and `j` into the `additional_marks` list. Given that `i` is the first element in `marks`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, we know that `i + j` is a positive integer satisfying the conditions specified (it is less than or equal to `l` and not an element in `marks`). The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least one element (specifically `y`), `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now contains an additional element equal to `i + j`.**
