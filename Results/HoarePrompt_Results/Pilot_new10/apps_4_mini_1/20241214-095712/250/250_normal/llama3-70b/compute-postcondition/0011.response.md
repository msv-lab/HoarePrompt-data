According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `need_y` is unchanged**
