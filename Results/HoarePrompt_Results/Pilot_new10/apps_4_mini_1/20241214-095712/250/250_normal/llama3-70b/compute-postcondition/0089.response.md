The variable `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value or how it affects the outcome directly. However, `j` is set to the second element in the `additional_marks` list, which has at least 2 elements. Therefore, the impact of the code will result in appending `i + j` to `additional_marks`.

The updated output state will include the fact that an additional element has been appended to `additional_marks`, but we cannot specify what `i` is; it remains unspecified in this context.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`.**
