The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Given the initial state where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not present in `marks`, the value that gets appended to `additional_marks` is valid and meets the conditions of the initial state.

After executing the code, `additional_marks` will have one more element added to it, which is the sum of `i` and `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `i` is the next element in `marks`; `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements (including the new element `i + j`); `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`; `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.**
