The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`, which was already its value prior to execution. There are no changes to other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True**
