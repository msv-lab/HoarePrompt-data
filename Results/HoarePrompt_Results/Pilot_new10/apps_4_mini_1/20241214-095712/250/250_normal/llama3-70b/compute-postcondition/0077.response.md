The value of `i` is the first element in `marks`, and the value of `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`. The code appends to `additional_marks` the value of `i + j`. Since `n` is a positive integer and does not affect other variables, its state remains unchanged. 

The output state must include the new value in `additional_marks` after the append operation. Thus, the new state reflects the updated content of `additional_marks`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains the original elements plus the new element `i + j`, with `j` being the third element of `additional_marks`.**
