To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided details.

1. **Understanding the current state**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `additional_marks` contains `y` appended to it (this indicates that `need_x` and `need_y` are both False).
   - The values of `i` and `j` are both `n - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop `for i in marks:` suggests that `marks` is the iterable that drives the loop execution. 

3. **Adjustments Needed**: 
   - To ensure that the loop executes, `marks` must contain at least one element.
   - The state indicates that `i` is currently set to `n - 1`, but we need to clarify how `i` should align with the `marks`. In this context, `i` would represent the current element from `marks`, and its value will be updated with each iteration.

Given these points, the following adjustments need to be made:

- `marks` must be a non-empty iterable for the loop to execute.
- Upon the first iteration, let's set `i` to the first element in `marks`.

Putting this all together, the required state can be specified as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `additional_marks` contains `y`, `i` is the first element in marks, `marks` must be a non-empty iterable**
