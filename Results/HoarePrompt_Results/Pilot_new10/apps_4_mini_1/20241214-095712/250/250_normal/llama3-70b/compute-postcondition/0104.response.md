Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the last element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains elements that are the sums of every element in `marks` added to every element in the original `additional_marks` where each sum is less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged from its initial state containing at least `y`, and `marks` is a non-empty iterable.**
