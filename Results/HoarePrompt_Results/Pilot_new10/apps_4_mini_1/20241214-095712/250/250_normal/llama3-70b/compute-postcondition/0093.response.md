According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute at least once, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element. Furthermore, knowing that `i` is defined as the next element in `marks`, we can assume that `i` is already a valid element at this point. 

However, to directly evaluate the state of `additional_marks`, we must also ensure that it has been correctly populated based on the provided condition (elements being less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`). If all these conditions are satisfied, the loop can execute.

Therefore, for the loop to run:
- `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element (i.e., it shouldn't be empty).
- `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`**
