Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least one element (specifically `y`), and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now contains an additional element equal to `i + j`.***
