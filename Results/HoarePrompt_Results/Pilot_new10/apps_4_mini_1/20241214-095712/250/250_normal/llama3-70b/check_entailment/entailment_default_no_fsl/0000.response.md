Correctness: **False**

The code fails to correctly determine the minimum number of additional marks needed on the ruler to measure both distances `x` and `y` for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Additional Marks**: The program adds `x` and `y` to the `additional_marks` list if they are not already possible to measure. However, it doesn't account for the necessary logic to ensure that both `x` and `y` can be measured after possibly adding new marks. The logic for generating new possible marks from existing marks does not guarantee that the required distances can be measured if `x` and `y` are both absent.

2. **Failing to Handle Combinations**: While the code checks for possible measurements of `x` and `y`, it does not consider the case where one additional mark may fulfill both needs. For instance, if `x` is measurable through an existing mark and then you might only need to add `y`, but the program will not consider adding marks strategically.

3. **Output Between Edge Cases**: In one of the provided examples (with only two marks at `0` and `300`), it is expected to add markers at `185` and `230`. If the code assumes `250` alone is sufficient but cannot reach both `185` and `230` without those exact additional marks, it will yield incorrect results.

One clear counterexample is when there are only two marks at the extremes (`0` and `l`), and both `x` and `y` distances are required, which cannot be generated from any sum of existing marks without adding specifically required values.

For these reasons, the code does not adhere to the problem requirements for every potential case, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
