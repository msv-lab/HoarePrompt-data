Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` is a non-empty iterable containing elements that meet the condition of `i + j` for each valid `j`, `j` is now the first valid element in `additional_marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and `i + j` is not an element of `marks`.***
