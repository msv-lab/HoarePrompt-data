Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2
- `i` is 1
- `need_x` is True
- `need_y` is True
- `j` is 2

The statement `need_y = True` does not change the value of `need_y` since it is already True. 

The other variables are unaffected, as there are no further operations or conditions that modify them.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is 2**
