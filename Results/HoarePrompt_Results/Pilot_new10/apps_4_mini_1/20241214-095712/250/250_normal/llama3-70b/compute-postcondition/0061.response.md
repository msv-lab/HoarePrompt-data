The code initializes `additional_marks` as an empty list. There are no changes to the values of the other variables, and if the loop condition is not satisfied (when `n` is less than 2), the states of `need_x` and `need_y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `y`, `i` must be `n - 1` and `j` is also `n - 1` if the loop executed at least `n` times; `additional_marks` is an empty list.**
