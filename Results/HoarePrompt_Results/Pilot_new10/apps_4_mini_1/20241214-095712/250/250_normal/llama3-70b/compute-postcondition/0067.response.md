Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `need_x` is False and `need_y` is also False, then `additional_marks` now contains the value of `y` appended to it, and the values of `i` and `j` remain as `n - 1`. If `need_y` is True, the program does not execute the if block, and the state is as described in the precondition.***
