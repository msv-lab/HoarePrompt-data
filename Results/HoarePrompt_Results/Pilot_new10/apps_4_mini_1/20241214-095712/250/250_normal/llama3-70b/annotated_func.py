#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), l is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and a is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l) representing the positions of the marks on the ruler.
def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `y`, `i` must be `n - 1` and `j` is also `n - 1` if the loop executed at least `n` times. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `need_x` and `need_y` retain their initial values, which are both False.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer. If `need_x` is False, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `y`, and `additional_marks` will contain `x`. The values of `i` and `j` remain as `n - 1` if the loop executed at least `n` times.
    if (not need_y) :
        additional_marks.append(y)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer. If `need_x` is False and `need_y` is also False, then `additional_marks` now contains the value of `y` appended to it, and the values of `i` and `j` remain as `n - 1`. If `need_y` is True, the program does not execute the if block, and the state is as described in the precondition.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is the last element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains elements that are the sums of every element in `marks` added to every element in the original `additional_marks` where each sum is less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged from its initial state containing at least `y`, and `marks` is a non-empty iterable.
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of marks and identifies if additional marks are needed to satisfy certain differences. It adds missing differences to an additional marks list, computes possible new marks by summing existing marks with the additional marks, and outputs the count and values of any new marks that can be formed without exceeding the bounds set by `l` or duplicating existing marks.
