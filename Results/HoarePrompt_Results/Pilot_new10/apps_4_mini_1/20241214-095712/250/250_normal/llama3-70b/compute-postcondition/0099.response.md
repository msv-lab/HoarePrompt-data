Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` includes the new element `i + j`.***
