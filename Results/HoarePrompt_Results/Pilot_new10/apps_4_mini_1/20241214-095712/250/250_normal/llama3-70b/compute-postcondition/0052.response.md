The variable `need_y` is explicitly set to `True`, which means it remains `True` as it was prior to the assignment, thus there is no change in its state. 

The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`) are unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True**.
