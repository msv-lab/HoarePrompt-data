According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 2. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True**.
