Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases as specified in the problem description. For instance, it does not ensure that the marks needed to measure both distances `x` and `y` can be added in such a way as to guarantee measurement.

**Issue 1: Inadequate Checking of Required Marks**
The program checks if the distances to be measured (`x` and `y`) can already be formed with the existing marks. However, if neither `x` nor `y` can be achieved directly, it tries to suggest adding only one new mark that enables measuring one or both of the distances which may not satisfy the requirement if the mark to be added is not correct.

**Example where it fails:**
Consider the input:
```
2 100 10 20
0 100
```
In this case, `x` (10) and `y` (20) cannot be measured from the existing marks. The program might only suggest to add one new mark, which doesn't guarantee both distances can be achieved. The expected output here should indicate both marks `10` and `20` need to be added for the students to be appropriately tested.

Thus, since the code does not ensure that necessary conditions are being met to measure both distances `x` and `y` accurately due to not adding both necessary marks, it is incorrect, hence the conclusion is **False**.
