To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it in the context of the problem description and identify any potential edge cases it may not handle correctly.

The program aims to ensure that the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using a ruler with existing marks, which can be supplemented by additional marks if necessary.

### Breakdown of Potential Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Condition Checking**: The program checks if a distance can be achieved by adding `x` or `y` to existing marks and also checks for subtraction, which is unnecessary. The requirement is simply whether the difference between two existing marks equals either `x` or `y`.
  
2. **Mark Addition Logic**: The logic that decides which additional marks to add is convoluted. The addition of `x` and `y` directly to existing marks, and then looking for conditions, does not correctly account for cases where simply having `x` or `y` as a mark might not be fulfilled by the existing marks.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not effectively handle situations where both `x` and `y` need to be added. For example, if the only mark is 0 and `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, the output should indicate that both need to be added.

### Example Input Where Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:

```
2 10 3 5
0 10
```

- Here, there are only two marks (0 and 10), and the user needs to measure distances of 3 and 5. 
- The current implementation may fail to realize that it cannot measure 3 or 5 since neither distance can be formed using the existing marks.
- Expected Output: `2` (adding marks at distances 3 and 5).
- The program might incorrectly output `1` since it tries to find an alternative way to measure without directly adding necessary marks.

### Conclusion:
The program has a flaw in logic that leads it to improperly deduce what additional marks are needed. It does not guarantee that all conditions specified in the problem statement can be fulfilled for any input.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
Correctness: **False**.
