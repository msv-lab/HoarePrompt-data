To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze the program step by step.

The program defines a function `func_1` that attempts to find the square frame around white pixels ('w') on a given monitor represented by a grid. The function aims to find the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost indices of white pixels in the grid and then create a frame using the '+' character.

1. The program initializes the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` as `None`.
2. It loops through the monitor's pixels, updating these variables based on the positions of the white pixels.
3. After identifying the boundaries of the frame, it checks if the frame dimensions are valid (if they are less than 2).
4. If the frame is valid, it modifies the grid to populate the frame with '+' characters.
5. Finally, the program either prints the modified grid or `-1` if a valid frame cannot be created.

### Potential Cases to Consider

1. **Insufficient Frame Size**: If we have an input where the only white pixels are adjacent to each other, making the frame size valid but the inner empty area must not be filled with '+' if it doesn't meet the required size of at least `2`.
2. **Multiple White Pixels Forming an Across Shape**: For example, if there are white pixels that could lead to multiple valid frames, the program may not honor the minimum required size properly. For instance:
    - Input:
      ```
      3 5
      .....
      .w.w.
      .....
      ```
      The expected output should be a frame of size 2 around the 'w' pixels, but the detection logic may not compute a viable frame since the outer area has '.' pixels.

3. **Single 'w' Pixel**: If there is only one 'w' pixel:
    - Input:
      ```
      3 3
      ...
      .w.
      ...
      ```
      The program should return `-1`, which it does not do correctly if it does not check for single pixel coverage properly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the function, we can see there are scenarios where the implementation does not adhere strictly to the problem requirements. Thus, the program could yield incorrect results for some configurations of white pixels.

Correctness: **False**.
