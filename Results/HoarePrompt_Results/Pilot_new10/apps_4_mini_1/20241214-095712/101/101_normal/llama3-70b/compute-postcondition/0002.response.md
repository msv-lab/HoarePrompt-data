The code snippet creates a list of tuples representing the coordinates of 'w' characters (white pixels) in the 2D list `pixels`. The list comprehension iterates through all indices of `pixels`, checking each character to see if it is 'w'. 

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are input values representing the dimensions of the list. The only variable that is affected is `white_pixels`, which will contain the coordinates of all pixels that were 'w'.

Given this understanding:

- `n` is assigned the input integer representing the number of lines.
- `m` is assigned the input integer representing the number of characters in each line.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` strings, each with `m` characters.
- `white_pixels` will be a list of tuples (i, j) for each position where pixels[i][j] is 'w'.

The exact value of `white_pixels` would depend on the specific input for `pixels`, but it will always list only the coordinates of 'w' characters.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the input integer representing the number of lines, `m` is assigned the input integer representing the number of characters in each line, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, and `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) for each position where pixels[i][j] is 'w'.**
