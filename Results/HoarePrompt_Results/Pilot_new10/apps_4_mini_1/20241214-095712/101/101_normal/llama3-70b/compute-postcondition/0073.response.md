Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `pixels[i][j]` has been updated accordingly. The value of `i` is neither `min_x` nor `max_x`, `j` is not `min_y`, and `j` is not `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.'; and `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to 'w'.***
