The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character `'+'` to a specific position in a 2D list named `pixels`. The indices used are `i` and `j`, where `i` is assigned the value `max_x + 1` if `n` is greater than `max_x`, and `j` is given the fixed value of `2`.

Since the condition `If n is greater than max_x` determines the value of `i`, it has an impact on the state of the variables. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than `max_x`, allowing us to set `i` to the new value `(max_x + 1)`.

The state of `m` does not impact this operation nor any other variables. Thus, `pixels[i][j]` will now hold the value `'+'` at the determined indices.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the changed conditions:

Output State: **If `n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `pixels[max_x + 1][2]` is '+'**.
