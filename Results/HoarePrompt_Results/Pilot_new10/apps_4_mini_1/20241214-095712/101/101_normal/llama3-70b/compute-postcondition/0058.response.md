Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1, then if the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` holds and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', `pixels[max_x + 1][1]` is set to '+'. If the condition does not hold, and `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', it skips to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value '.'***
