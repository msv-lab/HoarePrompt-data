The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the loop execution continues without further processing of the current iteration. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unmodified variables and indicate that we are bypassing the remainder of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
