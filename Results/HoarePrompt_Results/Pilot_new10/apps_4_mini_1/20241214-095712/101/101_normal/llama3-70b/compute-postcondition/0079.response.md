The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since it affects the flow of the program but not the actual values of any variables, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state after executing the code is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
