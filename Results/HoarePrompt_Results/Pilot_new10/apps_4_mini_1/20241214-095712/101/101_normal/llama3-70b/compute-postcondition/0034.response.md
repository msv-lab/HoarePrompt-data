Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`; `m` is greater than `max_y`; and `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`. If the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` holds true and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the current iteration of the loop is skipped; if it's not 'w', the iteration continues with `pixels[i][j]` remaining '.' and not skipping the iteration.***
