According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `pixels` list. If there is at least one non-empty row left to process in the `pixels` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `pixels` list contains at least one non-empty row, `n` is greater than 0, and `m` is greater than 0. After processing the current `row`, we can assume that one row has been taken from `pixels`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need at least one more non-empty row in `pixels`.

State: **`pixels` is a list of at least one non-empty row, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and there must be at least one non-empty row left to process**
