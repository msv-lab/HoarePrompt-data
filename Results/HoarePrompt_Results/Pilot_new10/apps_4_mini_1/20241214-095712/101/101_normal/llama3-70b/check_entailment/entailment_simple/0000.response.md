The provided program attempts to solve the problem of finding the smallest 1-pixel-wide square frame that encompasses all white pixels on a monitor display, represented by the given conditions. Here’s an analysis of the program to determine if it meets the problem description requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the monitor's resolution (n, m) and the pixel states into a list of lists, where each pixel is either '.' (black) or 'w' (white).

2. **Identifying White Pixels:**
   - It correctly identifies the coordinates of all white pixels and stores them in the `white_pixels` list.

3. **Determine Frame Bounds:**
   - The program calculates the minimum (min_x, min_y) and maximum (max_x, max_y) coordinates of the identified white pixels. This step is essential for accurately determining where the frame should be placed.

4. **Frame Size Calculation:**
   - The frame size is computed by taking the maximum distance between the identified corners (`max_x - min_x` and `max_y - min_y`) and adding 1 for the inclusive size.

5. **Frame Existence Check:**
   - The program checks if the calculated frame size exceeds the boundaries of the monitor. However, the condition should be based on ensuring that the frame can fit within the bounds; the frame cannot be larger than the monitor itself in both dimensions (this check currently only verifies against the maximum of n and m). 

6. **Frame Construction:**
   - The program attempts to construct the frame by updating the pixel list. It sets the appropriate border pixels to '+' and keeps the white pixels unchanged. However, the logic to determine whether to place '+' may not correctly fulfill the requirement laid out in the description. Specifically, if there are no additional pixels ('.') in the border area outside of 'w', the frame won't be correctly drawn.
   - It does not handle potential invalid positions for the frame appropriately—if there are gaps between the white pixels or any cases of not surrounding the white pixels correctly.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the modified pixel grid. However, the program needs to return `-1` correctly if a valid frame cannot be placed that surrounds all white pixels.

### Conclusion
The core issue with the program is that it may not correctly handle scenarios where the border for the required frame cannot be established due to lack of black pixels surrounding white pixels in the output, and it also needs more robust checks when calculating if the frame can possibly exist given its dimensions.

Thus, based on the problem description and the analysis, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **False**
