The code snippet updates `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum of their current values and the respective values `x` and `y` taken from the third tuple in `white_pixels`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, since `max_x` is updated to `max(max_x, x)`, and `max_y` is updated to `max(max_y, y)`, the output will reflect these updates.

Output State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` must have at least 3 tuples, (x, y) is the third tuple in the list; `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y), `max_x` is updated to max(max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(max_y, y)**
