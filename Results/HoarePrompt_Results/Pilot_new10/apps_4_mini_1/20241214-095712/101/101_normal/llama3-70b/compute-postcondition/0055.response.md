The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same, and no new values are assigned.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
