According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` list. The loop will only execute if `pixels` is not empty. Given the conditions provided:

1. If `n` is 0, `pixels` is an empty list, meaning the loop cannot execute.
2. If `m` is 0, `pixels` consists of empty strings for each row, which would also prevent the loop from executing because it will treat it as iterating over empty rows.

For the loop to execute, `pixels` must contain at least one row, which means `n` must be greater than 0, and all the rows must not be empty.

Therefore, we need to ensure that:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is greater than 0 and `pixels` is a list with at least one non-empty row.

State: **`pixels` is a list of at least one non-empty row, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
