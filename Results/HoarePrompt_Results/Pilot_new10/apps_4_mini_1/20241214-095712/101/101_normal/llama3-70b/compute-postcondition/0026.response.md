The statement `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the specific position in the `pixels` array at indices `i` and `j`. The initial state indicates that `pixels[i][j]` is not `'w'`, and the condition about the various variables (`i`, `j`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`) being false suggests that this assignment can legally take place without violating the constraints.

This operation directly modifies the `pixels` array at position `[i][j]` but does not affect the values or states of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j`. Therefore, after this operation, the state of `pixels[i][j]` will now be `'.'`, while the other aspects of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, it is not true that ((i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'), and pixels[i][j] is now '.'**
