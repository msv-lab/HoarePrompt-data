According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `i` is being iterated over the range defined by `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, where `max_x` must be less than `n` in order for the loop to execute again. 

We need to assume that in the current iteration, `i` is potentially equal to `max_x`, which means for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than `max_x`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`**
