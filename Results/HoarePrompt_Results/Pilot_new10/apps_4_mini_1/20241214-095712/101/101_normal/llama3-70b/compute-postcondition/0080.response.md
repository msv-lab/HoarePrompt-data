The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element `pixels[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `max_x + 2` and `j` is equal to `1`. The condition states that `n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, which means that `i` is at least equal to `n - 2`. Therefore, we are updating the `pixels` array at the position `(max_x + 2, 1)` to be `'.'`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `pixels[max_x + 2][1]` is '.'**.
