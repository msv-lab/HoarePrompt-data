The `print` function is used to output the result of `''.join(row)`, which concatenates all strings in a list `row`. However, the specific values of `row` depend on the current state of `pixels`. Since `pixels` is stated to be a list of at least one non-empty row, the result from the code execution will be a concatenation of that row.

Given that we don't have the exact values of `row`, the output will indicate that a string representation of the row is printed, without altering any variable values.

Output State: **`pixels` is a list of at least one non-empty row, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and a row is printed as a string formed by concatenating its elements.**
