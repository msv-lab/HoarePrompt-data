Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is either `min_y` or `max_y`, then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0, with `pixels[i][j]` being updated to '.' unless `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', in which case we skip the current loop iteration.***
