Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the situation correctly where the bounding box of the white pixels requires a frame that must not go beyond the borders of the screen. Specifically, the code calculates the frame size based on the maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels but does not ensure that the potential frame can fit within the dimensions of the monitor. If the white pixels are located too close to the edges or corners, the frame that should contain them cannot be formed correctly, but the program does not account for this.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```
Here the bounding box encompassing the white pixels (w) does not allow for a valid frame (+) to be placed without exceeding the grid boundaries. According to the problem requirements, the output should be -1 for this case, however, the program will incorrectly attempt to modify the grid and will not handle this edge case correctly.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements stated in the problem description for every potential case.
