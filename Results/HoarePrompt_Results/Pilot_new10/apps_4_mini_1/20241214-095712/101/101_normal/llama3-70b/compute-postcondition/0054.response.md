The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the specific position in the 2D list `pixels` indicated by `i` and `j`. Given the initial state, `i` is defined as `max_x + 1` and `j` is 1.

Since `n` is greater than `max_x`, it doesn't directly affect the assignment but gives context that the indices are in a valid range for the assignment, assuming that `pixels` has been initialized with sufficient dimensions. The variable `m` being greater than 0, and `j` being 1 are contextually valid for the operation.

No other variables are altered by this assignment, and the rest of the initial state remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `pixels[max_x + 1][1]` is now set to '+'**
