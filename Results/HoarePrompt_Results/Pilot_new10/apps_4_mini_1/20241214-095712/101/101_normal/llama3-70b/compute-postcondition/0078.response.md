The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element in the 2D array `pixels` at the position `[i][j]`. The value of `i` is `max_x + 2`, and `j` is `1`, which means that `pixels[max_x + 2][1]` will be set to `'+'`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged after this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `pixels[max_x + 2][1]` is set to '+'.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `pixels[max_x + 2][1]` is set to '+'**.
