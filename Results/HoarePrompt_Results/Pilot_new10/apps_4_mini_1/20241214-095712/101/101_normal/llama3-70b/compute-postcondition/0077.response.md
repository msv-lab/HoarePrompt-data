According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates over the range of `m`, and if `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0, which means the loop has the potential to execute at least once more. 

In this iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute one more time, the values of `j` and `m` must be updated accordingly. Since `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is increasing, `j` will become 1, and the program should check the conditions for executing again.

State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1**
