The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character `'+'` to the two-dimensional list `pixels` at the position specified by the indices `i` and `j`. Given that `i` can be either `min_x` or `max_x`, and `j` can be `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, we can determine that the specific indices for adding `'+'` depend on these possible values.

Since `m` is greater than `max_y`, it does not influence the assignment of the value, and `n` (being greater than or equal to 0) is not directly affected by this operation as it does not participate in the assignment.

Thus, the impact of the code is that the value at the specific indices `i` and `j` in the `pixels` matrix is changed to `'+'`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`; `m` is greater than `max_y`; `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1; pixels[i][j] is '+'**
