Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If the condition (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) holds true and `pixels[max_x + 1][0]` is updated to '+'. If the condition does not hold true but `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '.', with `i` remaining neither `min_x` nor `max_x`, and `j` remaining neither `min_y` nor `max_y`.***
