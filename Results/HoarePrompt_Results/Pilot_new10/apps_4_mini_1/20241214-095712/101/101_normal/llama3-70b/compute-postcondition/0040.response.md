Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`; `m` is greater than `max_y + 1`; and `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`. If either `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y`, `max_y` and if `pixels[i][j]` was '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is now updated to '+'. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` remains as '.' or potentially some other state where if it was 'w', certain operations related to a 'w' pixel occurred, otherwise it indicates a different operation is executed, resulting in `pixels[i][j]` being '.' once again.***
