According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j` which ranges from 0 to `m - 1`. The iteration will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by 1, resulting in `j` becoming either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`. 

Additionally, since the loop iterates until `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to run again, `m` must be greater than `max_y + 1` if `j` was `max_y + 1`, or greater than `min_y + 1` if `j` was `min_y + 1`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states accordingly to reflect these conditions.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`; `m` is greater than `max_y + 1`; and `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`.**
