In this case, the code is assigning a value to the element at the position defined by the indices `i` and `j` in a 2D array named `pixels`. 

Given the initial state:
- If `n` is greater than `max_x`, then `i` is set to `max_x + 1`.
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `j` is 2.

The operation `pixels[i][j] = '.'` modifies the element in the `pixels` array at the specified coordinates. 

However, we note that while the variables themselves are not changed directly by this operation, the value at `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`. The previous values of the affected variables remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State will include the information about the array modification, while retaining the values of `n`, `max_x`, `m`, and `j`:

Output State: **If `n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value '.'**
