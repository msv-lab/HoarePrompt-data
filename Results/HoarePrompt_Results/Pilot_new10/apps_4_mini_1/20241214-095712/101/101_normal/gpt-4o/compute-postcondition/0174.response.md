Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen` with unchanged positions except for the modified boundaries, `i` is `top + 1` which is the current value of `i`, `j` is equal to `left` which is the current value of `j`, and the character at position `result[i][j]` is '.'***
