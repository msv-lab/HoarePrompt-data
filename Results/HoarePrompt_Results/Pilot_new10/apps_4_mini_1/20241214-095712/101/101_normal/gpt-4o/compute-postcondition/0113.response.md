Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 0, `left` remains 0, and the current value of `j` is greater than `right`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` remains 0, and `screen[2][0]` is 'w'. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, all initial conditions stated in the precondition persist.***
