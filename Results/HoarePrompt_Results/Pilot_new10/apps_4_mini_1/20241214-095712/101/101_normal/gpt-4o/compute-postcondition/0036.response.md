The instruction `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to both `top` and `bottom`. The values of `top` and `bottom` are now both 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The output state summarizes the valid precondition information along with the updated values of `top` and `bottom`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0**
