The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Since `i` (1) is greater than `bottom`, the previous value of `bottom` is not known, but it is now updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[1][0]` is 'w', `bottom` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[1][0]` is 'w'.**
