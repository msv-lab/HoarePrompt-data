According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `top` and `bottom`. The loop iterates from `top` to `bottom`, inclusive. If `i` is less than or equal to `bottom`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `top`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and we need to ensure that `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`.

Thus:
1. If `i` is currently equal to `top`, it will be incremented to `top + 1` for the next iteration.
2. For the loop to execute once more, `top + 1` must still be less than or equal to `bottom`, which implies that `bottom` must be at least `top + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen` with unchanged positions except for the modified boundaries, `i` is `top + 1`.**
