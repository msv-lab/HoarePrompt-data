Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is undefined, `right` is undefined, `j` is 2. If `i` is less than `top`, the program follows the designated procedure for this condition. Otherwise, no action is performed since there is no else part defined.***
