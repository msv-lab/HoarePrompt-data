Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `top` is 0. Since `i` (which is 0) is not less than `top` (which is also 0), the function does not change the values or relationships of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, or `top`, maintaining their initial states.***
