According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `left`, and `right`. The range for `j` is defined as from `left` to `right + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be equal to `left`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented. Thus, the next value of `j` would be `left + 1`. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `j` must remain less than or equal to `right`. 

Since `right` is greater than or equal to `left`, we can summarize that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would equal `left + 1`, and `right` must remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, and `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`, `j` is `left + 1`**
