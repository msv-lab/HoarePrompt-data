According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. For the loop to execute, the integer variable `i` must be initialized to the first value of the range defined by `n`, which is 0 during the first iteration. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (as per the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), the loop will indeed be able to execute.

However, we must also consider the initial values of any other state variables that may be relevant. In this case, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` do not influence the loop execution directly since they are None.

Thus, the key states to adjust for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be initialized to 0.

The `screen` state, `n`, and `m` values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, though the loop will iterate according to the current values of `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None**
