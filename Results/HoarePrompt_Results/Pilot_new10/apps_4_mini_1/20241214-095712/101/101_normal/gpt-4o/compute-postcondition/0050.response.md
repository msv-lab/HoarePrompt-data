According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. The states related to `j` should also be considered as it is the loop variable that will be used to iterate.

Given that `i` is at 1, which might indicate the start index of some context related to the loop body, but doesn't necessarily affect the loop execution, the critical factor ensuring the loop runs at least once is `m`. On the first iteration, `j` will be initialized to 0, since the loop starts with `j` being 0 in the standard iteration for range in Python.

Thus, for the loop to execute properly, we can confirm that `j` starts at 0, and `m` is confirmed to be at least 1, enabling the loop to run.

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `j` is 0**
