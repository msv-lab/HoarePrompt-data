The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. There is no indication of the initial value of `j` or any potential conditions that might affect its assignment. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1; `right` is equal to `j`.**
