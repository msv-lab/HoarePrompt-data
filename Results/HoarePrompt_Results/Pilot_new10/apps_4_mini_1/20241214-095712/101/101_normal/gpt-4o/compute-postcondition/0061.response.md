Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, and the state remains unchanged because `i` is 1, which is not greater than `bottom` (1). Therefore, if `i` were to be greater than `bottom`, the function would proceed without any alterations to the variables as `i` is not exceeding `bottom`.***
