The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is currently 1, both `left` and `right` will be set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `left` and `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1**
