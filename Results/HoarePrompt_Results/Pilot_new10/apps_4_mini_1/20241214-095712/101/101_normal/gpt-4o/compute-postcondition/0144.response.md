Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' encountered, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' encountered, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' encountered, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, and `j` must have gone through all values from 0 to m-1. If 'w' was encountered, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` would reflect the boundaries of all 'w' characters indexed by `i`. If no 'w' was encountered, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are still undefined.**
