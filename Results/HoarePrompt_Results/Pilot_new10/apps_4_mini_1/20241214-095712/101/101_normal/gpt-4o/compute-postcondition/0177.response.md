Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, and `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`. If `i` equals `top` or `bottom`, or if `j` equals `left` or `right`, and if the character at position `result[i][j]` is '.', then the character at `result[top + 1][left]` is updated to '+', with `i` remaining `top + 1` and `j` remaining `left`. Otherwise, there is no effect on the state of `result`.***
