According to the loop definition, it will execute while `i` is less than `n`. We need to assess the current values of `i` and `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer that is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment by 1, leading to `i` being 2. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can continue as long as `i` remains less than `n`.

The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged if 'w' is not found in the current row. They would only be modified if 'w' is found in the row corresponding to the new value of `i`. 

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' encountered, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' encountered, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' encountered, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered.**
