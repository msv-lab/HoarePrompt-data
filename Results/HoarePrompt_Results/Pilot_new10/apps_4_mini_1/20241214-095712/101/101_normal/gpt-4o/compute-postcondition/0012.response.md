The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. Since the current value of `i` is 0, `bottom` will now take the value 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is not None, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
