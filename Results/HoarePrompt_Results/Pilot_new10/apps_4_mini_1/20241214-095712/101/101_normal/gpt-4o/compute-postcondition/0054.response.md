The values of `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is currently 0, both `left` and `right` will now be set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged and the current value of `screen[1][0]` is still 'w'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[1][0]` is 'w'.**
