Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is undefined, `j` is 2. If `j` is less than `left` (which is 2), no action is performed since the condition is not satisfied. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged in this context.***
