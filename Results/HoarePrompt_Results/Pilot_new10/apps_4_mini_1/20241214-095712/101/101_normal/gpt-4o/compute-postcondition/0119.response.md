After executing the code, `top` is assigned the value of `i`, and `bottom` is also assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is 2. Thus, `top` and `bottom` will both become 2, which means their values remain unchanged, since they were already equal to `i`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 1**
