Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, and `left` is 1. If `j` is less than `left`, the state remains unchanged; if `j` is not less than `left`, the state also remains unchanged.***
