The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Other variables remain unaffected by this code. Therefore, the state of the variables updates only for `bottom`, and other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `j` is 2, and `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'.**
