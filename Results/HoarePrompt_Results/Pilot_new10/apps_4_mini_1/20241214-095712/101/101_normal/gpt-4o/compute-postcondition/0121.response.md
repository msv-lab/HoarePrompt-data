The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. Since `i` was initially 2, the value of `top` becomes 2 as well. The other variables remain unchanged and their states are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 1**
