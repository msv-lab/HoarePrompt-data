The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. Since the condition regarding `i` and `bottom` involves no changes to `i`, `top`, or `bottom`, only the variable `left` is affected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `left`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is undefined, `j` is 2**
