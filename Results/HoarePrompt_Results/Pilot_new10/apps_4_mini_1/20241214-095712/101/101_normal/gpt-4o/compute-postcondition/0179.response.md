The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at the position `[i][j]` in the `result` list. The value of `j` is calculated as `left + 1`. The variable `result` contains lists of characters from the `screen`, and since `j` (which is `left + 1`) is in the range defined by `left` and `right`, the assignment affects the state of `result`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as there are no operations performed on them. The value of `result[i][j]` now becomes the character `'+'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result[i][j]` is '+' where `j` is `left + 1`, `j` is `left + 1`.**
