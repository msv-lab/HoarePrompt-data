The variables `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `0`. Therefore, after executing the code, both `top` and `bottom` will be `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0. The values of `left`, `right` remain None.**
