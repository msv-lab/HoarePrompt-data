According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j` which ranges from 0 to `m - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` needs to increase by 1. With `j` at the end of the last iteration being either 0 or retaining its previous value (not mentioned, but assuming it did not reset), it suggests that previously `j` was less than `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `m` is at least 1 (as given), the loop can execute one more time with `j` increasing to 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, and `j` is 1**
