Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is not None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than `top`, the conditions remain unchanged; otherwise, there is no else part to affect the state.***
