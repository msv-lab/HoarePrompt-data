Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is not None, `bottom` is None, `left` is 0, `right` is None, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `j` is less than `left`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, if `j` is not less than `left`, the conditions also remain unchanged.***
