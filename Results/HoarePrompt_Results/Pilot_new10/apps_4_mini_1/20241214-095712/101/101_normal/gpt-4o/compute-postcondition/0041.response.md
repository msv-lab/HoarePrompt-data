Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, the function maintains the same values and relationships of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, the values remain unchanged, as `i` is 0 and `bottom` is also 0.***
