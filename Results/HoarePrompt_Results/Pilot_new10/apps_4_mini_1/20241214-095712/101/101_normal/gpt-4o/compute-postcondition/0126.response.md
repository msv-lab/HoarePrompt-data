Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered. If `j` is less than `left`, `left` is updated to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `left`, the conditions remain unchanged.***
