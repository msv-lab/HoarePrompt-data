Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, and `bottom` remains 1. If `top` is None, then `top`, `left`, and `right` are each set to 1, and `j` is 1 with `screen[1][0]` remaining 'w'. Otherwise, `top` is set to 1, `bottom` remains 1, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`; if `j` is less than or equal to `right`, there are no changes to the states of the other variables.***
