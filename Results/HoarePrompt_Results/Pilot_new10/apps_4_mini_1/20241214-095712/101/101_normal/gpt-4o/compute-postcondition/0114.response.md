The value of `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial condition states that the current value of `j` is greater than `right`, which implies that `right` is initially less than `j`. Therefore, `right` will now hold the value of `j`, making it equal to `j`. Since the other variable conditions remain unchanged, the output state reflects the updated value of `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `right` is equal to `j`, `j` is 0, `left` remains 0, and if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` remains 0, and `screen[2][0]` is 'w'.**
