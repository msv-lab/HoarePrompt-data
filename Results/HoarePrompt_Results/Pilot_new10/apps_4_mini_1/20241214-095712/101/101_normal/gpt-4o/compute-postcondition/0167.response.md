The statement `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character `'+'` to the position `(i, j)` in the list `result`. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment and there are no conditions provided that would change the values of `i` and `j`, we can assume these variables retain their defined states. 

The conditions state that `j` is the next value for the loop to continue execution, meaning `j` is within a defined range based on `right + 1`, and while we don't have specific values for `i` or `j`, we know they are valid indices for the list `result`.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `j` is an integer, `result[i][j]` is '+'**.
