Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to the value of `j`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
