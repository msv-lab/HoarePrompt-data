The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given that `j` is 2, both `left` and `right` will be assigned the value 2. The initial conditions of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged, while `left` and `right` will now have specific values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `j` is 2**
