Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of digits and base for both numbers X and Y, followed by the digits themselves. This follows the input specifications provided.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base, converting the base representation into a base 10 integer using the formula \(result = result \times base + digit\). This accurately computes the decimal value of numbers from arbitrary bases (between 2 and 40, as specified).

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to their decimal equivalents, the program compares them using standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, and `=`) and prints the appropriate character based on the comparison.

Given the constraints and the logic applied, I cannot find an input case where the program behaves incorrectly according to the problem description. The handling of edge cases, such as the maximum number of digits and the range of bases, is also appropriately managed by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is functioning correctly as intended.
