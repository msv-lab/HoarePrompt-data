The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `digits`, which contains integers representing the digits of a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` that ranges from 2 to 40. The length of the list `digits` is between 1 and 10, and each digit within the list is non-negative and less than the specified base. After executing the function, it returns the decimal representation of the integer formed by the digits in the `digits` list based on the given `base`. If the `digits` list is empty, the function returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number, and an integer `base` between 2 and 40. It returns the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in the specified `base`, or 0 if `digits` is empty.**
