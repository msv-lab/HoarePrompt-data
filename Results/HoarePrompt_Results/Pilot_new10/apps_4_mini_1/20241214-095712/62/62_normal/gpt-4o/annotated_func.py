#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in the specified base, and base is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40. The length of digits is between 1 and 10, and each digit is non-negative and less than the base.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `decimal_value` is the decimal representation of the integer formed by the digits in the list `digits` in base `base`; if `digits` is empty, then `decimal_value` is 0.
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns the decimal representation of the integer formed by the digits in the list 'digits' in base 'base', which is stored in 'decimal_value'. If 'digits' is empty, 'decimal_value' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number, and an integer `base` between 2 and 40. It returns the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in the specified `base`. The function does not handle cases where `digits` contains invalid values (i.e., values not less than the `base`), which could lead to incorrect calculations or assumptions about what constitutes valid input. If `digits` is empty, a return value of 0 is given, as per the annotations.
