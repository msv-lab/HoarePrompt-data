Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle invalid values in the input digits appropriately. Specifically, it does not check that each digit in the representation of numbers X and Y is less than its respective base. While the problem description states the digits will always be valid (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x} and 0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}), the program assumes this without any explicit checks. If, for any reason, the input does contain an invalid digit, the program could yield incorrect results, as the conversion to decimal would be flawed.

Let's illustrate the issue with an example:

Suppose the input provided is:
```
3 10
1 10 0
1 5
2 1
```
Here, digits_x contains a digit (10) which is not less than b_x (10). The program will still attempt to process this input and could lead to erroneous outputs, despite the assumptions about the input made in the problem description.

Essentially, the program's correctness hinges on the input being within the specified constraints, which isn't guaranteed by the program itself. Thus, the lack of validation for digits leads to a failure to satisfy the requirements of the problem description, making the program incorrect for all potential edge cases.
