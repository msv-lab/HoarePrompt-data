Correctness: **True**

The provided program satisfies the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the inputs as specified, first capturing the values for the number of digits and their respective base for both numbers X and Y.

2. **Conversion Function**: The function `func_1` correctly converts a list of digits representing a number in a given base into its decimal (base 10) equivalent. It does this by iteratively multiplying the current result by the base and adding the current digit. This is precisely how numbers in non-decimal bases are converted to decimal.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers X and Y to their decimal equivalents, the program compares these two values:
   - It uses `<` to check if X is less than Y, `>` to check if X is greater than Y, and `=` for equality. This is exactly how the outputs are expected as per the problem description.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The annotations and the implementation ensure that there are no faulty assumptions made about the data, such as leading zeroes or invalid digit values, as both constraints from the problem description are adhered to (0 â‰¤ digit < base for each number).

5. **Output Format**: Finally, the output matches the required single character response ('<', '>', or '=') depending on the comparison result.

Hence, under all described scenarios, the program performs correctly based on the given problem description and adheres to all requirements specified.
