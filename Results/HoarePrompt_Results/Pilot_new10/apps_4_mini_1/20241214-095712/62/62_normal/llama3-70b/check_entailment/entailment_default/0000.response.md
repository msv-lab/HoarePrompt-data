The program correctly implements the functionality of comparing two numbers provided in different bases. The provided function `func_1` converts the list of digits from its respective base into a decimal integer, which is then used to perform the comparison.

1. The program correctly reads the inputs and organizes them into appropriate variables for processing.
2. The conversion logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of the number represented by the given digits and base. It does this iteratively, ensuring that it accounts for the place value of each digit.
3. The comparison part correctly outputs '<', '>', or '=' based on the results of the conversions.

The output hint states that the function can return 0 for empty input, but based on the problem constraints (1 â‰¤ n, m), there will always be at least one digit for both X and Y, so this case is not possible in the given problem statement.

For all the provided examples in the problem description, the program will yield the expected results:

- In the first example, both numbers represent the same decimal value resulting in '='.
- In the second example, the decimal equivalent clearly shows that X is less than Y, hence '<'.
- In the third example, the higher starting digits in the base 16 number demonstrates X is greater than Y resulting in '>'.

Since the logic correctly processes the input and adheres to the specified rules, there are no edge cases ignored or misunderstood.

Correctness: **True**.
