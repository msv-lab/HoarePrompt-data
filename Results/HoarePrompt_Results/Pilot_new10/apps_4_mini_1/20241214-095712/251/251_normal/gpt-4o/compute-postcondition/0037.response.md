According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates `j` from `0` up to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, which is a positive integer within the range `2 ≤ n ≤ 100000`. Since `i` is `n`, the current loop iteration for `j` must be `n` (which is `i`), meaning the last value of `j` is `i - 1` (or `n - 1`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n`, allowing the loop to continue. Therefore, the value of `j` needs to be `n`, and since `j` is incremented with each iteration, the updated states at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `dp[n]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[1]` and `volumes[n]` if `volumes[1]` is less than `volumes[n]`.**
