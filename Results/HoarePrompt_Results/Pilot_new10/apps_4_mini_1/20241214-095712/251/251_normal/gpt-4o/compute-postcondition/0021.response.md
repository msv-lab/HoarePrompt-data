According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is `n`. Since `i` is equal to `n` and `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), the next value of `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i` (which is equal to `n`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1, and `i` should still remain `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1**
