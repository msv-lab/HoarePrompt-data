The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer which satisfies the constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. The parameter `cakes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `r_i` and `h_i` that represent the radius and height of each cake, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10000. 

After executing the function body, it returns the maximum sum of volumes achievable from valid sequences based on the criteria that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` for all indices `j` less than `i`, which is represented by the maximum value in the `dp` list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of cake dimensions, and return the maximum sum of volumes from valid sequences of those cakes according to the specified criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples cakes representing the dimensions of each cake, and returns the maximum sum of volumes from valid sequences of cakes based on the specified criteria.**
