Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; if `volumes[j]` (where `j = n`) is less than `volumes[i]` (where `i = n`), then `dp[n]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[n]` and `volumes[n]` if `volumes[1]` is less than `volumes[n]`. Otherwise, `dp[n]` remains unchanged.***
