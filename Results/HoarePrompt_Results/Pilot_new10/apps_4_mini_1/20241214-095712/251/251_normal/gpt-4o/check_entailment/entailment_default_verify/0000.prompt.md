You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze its functionality step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We are given n cakes, each defined by its radius (r) and height (h). The volume of each cylindrical cake can be calculated using the formula: \( V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \).
   - We need to stack these cakes following the rule that a cake can only be placed on another if it has a strictly greater volume than the cake below it.

2. **Functionality of the Program**:
   - The program computes the volume of each cake and stores these in a list.
   - Using dynamic programming:
     - It builds an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum volume achievable with cake `i` on top (including the volume of cake `i` itself).
     - For each cake `j` (prior to `i`), it updates `dp[i]` if the volume of cake `i` is greater than the volume of cake `j`, adding cake `j`'s maximum achievable volume to `dp[i]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The building of the cakes stack using the volumes is done correctly.
   - The final result is formatted to 6 decimal places, complying with the output requirements.
   - The logic seems to handle cases of stacking cakes based on the volume condition.

4. **Potential Problem Cases**:
   - A key aspect to check is whether the program can handle edge cases where:
       - All cakes have the same volume, ensuring that the stacking logic behaves correctly without adding volumes incorrectly.
       - The minimal input size (n=1) should return the volume of that one cake.
       - The case where multiple cakes could stack but only one cake is needed to achieve the maximum overall volume correctly.

Given that the program correctly implements the solution according to these specifications and handles edge cases appropriately, I find no errors in the implementation.

Thus, the final evaluation of the program's correctness based on the above analysis is:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of each cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and returns the maximum sum of volumes from valid sequences of cakes such that the volume of each cake included in the sequence is greater than the previous one. If no valid sequences exist, it will still return the maximum volume from individual cakes. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing the radius and height of `n` cakes, then it processes these inputs via another function `func_1` and prints the result. However, it does not account for any potential input errors or details regarding the functionality of `func_1`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
