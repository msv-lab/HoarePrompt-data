`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `volumes[i]`. The previous value of `i` is `n`, which is within the range of 1 to 100000. The state of `j` is still in the range [0, n-1], but since the loop has completed, `j` does not change. The output state remains focused on `n`, `i`, and `dp[i]`, as well as the value assigned from `volumes`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `i` is `n`; `j` is in the range [0, n-1]; `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[n]`.**
