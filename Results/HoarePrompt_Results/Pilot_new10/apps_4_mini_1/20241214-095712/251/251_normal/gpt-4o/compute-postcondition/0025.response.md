In the given code snippet, `dp[i]` is being updated based on the maximum value between `dp[i]` and the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`. The impacted variables are `dp[i]`, `dp[j]`, and `volumes[i]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\)
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `j` is equal to 2

The expression `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])` implies that:
- The new value of `dp[i]` will be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`.

The specific values of `dp[i]`, `dp[j]`, and `volumes[i]` are not provided, so we will denote:
- `dp[i]` before the operation as `dp[n]` (since `i` is `n`)
- `dp[j]` as `dp[2]`
- `volumes[i]` as `volumes[n]`

Thus, the output will reflect the change in `dp[n]` and the unchanged values of the other variables:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `i` is `n`; `j` is 2; dp[n] is max(dp[n], dp[2] + volumes[n])**
