According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `i`. The loop iterates over `j` such that it runs from `0` to `i - 1`. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least `1`, it means the current value of `i` allows for the loop to execute with `j` values ranging from `0` to `i - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to increase by `1`, thus allowing for an additional iteration where `j` can be equal to `i` (that is, it should be able to iterate from `0` to `i`, which corresponds to a total of `i + 1` iterations). This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `i + 1` and `j` must be able to take on this new value. 

Given that the requirement for `dp[i]` updates is based on the relationship with `volumes`, `volumes[i]` will need to be a valid indexing position which implies that `volumes` must have elements defined up to `i + 1`.

Thus, after this reasoning, the state adjustments will be:
- `i` incremented to `i + 1`
- `volumes` must be such that they can accommodate the new index `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `i` is at least 2, and `dp[0]` is equal to `volumes[0]`. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.**
