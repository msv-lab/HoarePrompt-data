Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of each cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and returns the maximum sum of volumes from valid sequences of cakes such that the volume of each cake included in the sequence is greater than the previous one. If no valid sequences exist, it will still return the maximum volume from individual cakes. **
