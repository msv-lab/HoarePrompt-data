According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so now `j` will be 1. Since `i` is equal to `n`, it must be ensured that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing. 

Therefore, the updated states are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1**
