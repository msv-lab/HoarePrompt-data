Postcondition: ***`dp[2]` remains the maximum value previously calculated; `dp[n]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`; `i` is greater than 1; `j` is 1. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to either the previous value of `dp[i]` or `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`.***
