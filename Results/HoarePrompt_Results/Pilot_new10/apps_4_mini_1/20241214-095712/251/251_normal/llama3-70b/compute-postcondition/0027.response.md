Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` contains the maximum possible values calculated based on the conditions of the loop for each corresponding cake index, with `dp[i]` potentially being updated based on earlier `dp[j]` values where `j < i` and if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`. If no such `j` satisfies the condition for any `i`, then `dp[i]` retains its initial value, which is either `cakes[i][0]` or `0.0`.**
