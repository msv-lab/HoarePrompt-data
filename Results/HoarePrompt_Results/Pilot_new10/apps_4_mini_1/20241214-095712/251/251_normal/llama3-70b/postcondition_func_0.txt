The function reads a positive integer `n`, then accepts `n` pairs of integers representing the radius and height of cakes. It calculates the volume for each cake and stores the volumes along with their dimensions in a list. The function then determines the maximum possible volume obtainable by stacking cakes, where a cake can only be placed on top of another if both its radius and height are smaller than those of the cake below it. Finally, it prints the maximum achievable volume using these rules. No values are returned from the function.
