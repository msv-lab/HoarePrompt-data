According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1, since `range(i)` generates numbers from 0 to i-1. The state of `dp[2]` and `dp[n]` does not influence whether the loop executes, but we need to ensure that `j` can be initialized correctly.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `i` is greater than 0, and at the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 0 on the first iteration.

State: **`dp[2]` remains the maximum value previously calculated, `dp[n]` is now equal to `cakes[n][0]`, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
