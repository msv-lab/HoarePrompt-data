Output State: **`dp[2]` is the maximum value of `dp[2]` updated based on the conditions involving all previous `j` indices (0 to 1), where `j` indices correspond to the tuples in `cakes`. The conditions depend on the comparisons of `cakes[i][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` with the respective values in `cakes[j]`. `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order by volume. If no condition was satisfied, `dp[2]` remains equal to its initial value `cakes[2][0]`.**
