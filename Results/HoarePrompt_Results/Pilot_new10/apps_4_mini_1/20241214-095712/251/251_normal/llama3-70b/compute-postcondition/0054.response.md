Output State: **`dp` is a list containing the maximum possible values calculated based on the conditions of the loop for each corresponding cake index, where `dp[i]` represents the maximum value obtainable using the cakes that satisfy the given conditions, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, and if no valid preceding cakes are found for a particular `i`, `dp[i]` retains its initial value `cakes[i][0]`. If `n` is 1, then `dp` will simply contain the value of `cakes[0][0]`.**
