Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp[0]` is `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[3]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for some valid index `j`. Otherwise, `dp[3]` remains unchanged.***
