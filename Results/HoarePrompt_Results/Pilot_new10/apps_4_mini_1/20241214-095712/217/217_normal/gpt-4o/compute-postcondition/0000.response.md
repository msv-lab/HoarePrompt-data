The code assigns `n` the value of `int(input())`, which reads an integer input. The precondition states that `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and since the code updates `n`, it will now hold the value of the input provided as an integer. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
