Based on the provided instructions, the code snippet provided simply prints the value of `result`. The initial state contains the following variables: 

- `n` is an integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100
- `B` is equal to the sum of all positive integers in `a`
- `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`
- `result` is equal to `B - C`

Since the print function does not alter any variables, the previous values stay the same. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `B` is equal to the sum of all positive integers in `a`, `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`, `result` is equal to `B - C` and the value of `result` has been printed.**
