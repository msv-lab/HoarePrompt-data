Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and it functions as expected for all input cases within the specified constraints.

1. The function reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the sequence `a`. This portion adheres to the given constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

2. The program receives a list of integers `a`, which are elements bound within the range -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, as required by the problem description.

3. The program calculates the sum `B` of all positive integers present in the list `a`. This is aligned with the task of maximizing the sum of one sequence (b) that contains only non-negative integers.

4. It also calculates the sum `C` of all negative integers (if any) in the list `a`. In the context of the equation B - C, this means that C will be added to the total difference even if it is negative, thus effectively subtracting a negative number which increases the overall value.

5. Finally, the output of the program is `B - C`, which directly corresponds to the objective stated in the problem. The function accurately computes the maximum possible value of B - C.

Thus, the program executes the required logic effectively, and there are no uncovered edge cases based on the input constraints provided in the problem description.
