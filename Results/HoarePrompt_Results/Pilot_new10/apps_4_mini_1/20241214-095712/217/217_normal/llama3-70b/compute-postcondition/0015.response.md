The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and it's also specified that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. The code `b += a[i]` indicates that the value at index `i` of list `a` is being added to `b`.

Assuming `a` is a list where the index `i` is valid (i.e., `0 ≤ i < len(a)`), the operation modifies `b` by incrementing it by the value of `a[i]`. The prior values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but the value of `b` is updated.

Since `n` is not directly affected and must still satisfy the condition of being a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, we acknowledge that.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and must be greater than `i + 1;` `b` has been updated to `b + a[i]`**.
