Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order. If `i` is even, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, `c` is set to 0, and `i` remains 0. If `i` is odd, `b` remains 0; `c` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]`, and `i` is an odd integer.***
