To analyze the output state after the completion of the loop, we first recognize that the loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive even integer ranging from 2 to 100. During each iteration, an integer from input is appended to the list `a`. 

1. The loop will execute `n` times, meaning it will gather `n` integer inputs and store them in the list `a`.
2. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`, thus after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
3. The list `a` will contain exactly `n` integers, corresponding to each input taken during the loop's execution.

Given that `n` is an even integer and the range specified, the output state after the loop completes should reflect these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers from input.**
