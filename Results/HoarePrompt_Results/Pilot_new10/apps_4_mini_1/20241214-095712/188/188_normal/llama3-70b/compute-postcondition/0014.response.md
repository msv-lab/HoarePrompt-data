The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is specified as the first integer in the list `a`, it is also mentioned that `i` is not an element of `d`. 

After executing the code, `d` now contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100; `i` is the first integer in list `a`; `a` is a list containing `n` integers; `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1.**
