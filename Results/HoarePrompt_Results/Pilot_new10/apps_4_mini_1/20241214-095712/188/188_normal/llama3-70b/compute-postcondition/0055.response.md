Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains all unique integers from the list `a`, `c` indicates the number of integers in `d` that have a count equal to `n // 2` (0, 1, or 2), `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1, or both are -1, meaning either there are no keys in `d` with a count equal to `n // 2`, or there is only one such key.***
