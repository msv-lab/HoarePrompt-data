According to the code, the loop will execute again for the next key in `d`. Since `i` is currently the next key in `d`, which has been processed in the previous iteration, we need to think about what `i` becomes in the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100.
- `d` contains at least 1 more key, so we can still loop.
- `c` is 0, meaning the condition regarding `n // 2` for `d[i]` was not met.
- `a1` remains as it is.
- `a2` also remains unchanged.
- `i` now will move to the next key in `d`.

Thus, to allow for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to point to this next key in `d`. Since `c` was initially 0, no changes will occur to `c` or `a1`, but `a2` will take the value of the next corresponding key in `d`.

State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 0, `a1` remains as it is, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` is the next key in `d`**
