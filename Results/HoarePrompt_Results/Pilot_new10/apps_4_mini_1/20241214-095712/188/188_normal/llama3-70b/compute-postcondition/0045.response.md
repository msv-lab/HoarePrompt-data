The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The variable `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, and since it is updated to take the next key, the value of `a1` becomes that value. The other variables remain unchanged in their conditions. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 0, `a1` is equal to the next key in `d`, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` is the next key in `d`.**
