Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains all unique integers from the list `a`, `c` indicates the number of integers in `d` that have a count equal to `n // 2`, `a1` is the first key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2`, `a2` is the second key in `d` for which the count equals `n // 2`. Both `a1` and `a2` have values from `d` since `c` is 2.***
