The variable `a` has an integer appended to it from input, where that integer is cast to `int`. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged as `n` is an even integer in the range from 2 to 100, and `i` also remains unchanged as it is set to 2. The change occurs only in `a`, which now includes an additional integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is 2, `a` has an additional integer appended from input.**
