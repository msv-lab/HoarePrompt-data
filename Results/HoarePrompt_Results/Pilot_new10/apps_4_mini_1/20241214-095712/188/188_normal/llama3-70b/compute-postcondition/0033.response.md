The statement `a2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `a2`. In the initial state, `a2` is -1 and `i` is defined as the first key in `d`. Therefore, after executing the code, `a2` will take on the value of `i`, changing from -1 to the value of the first key in `d`. The values of `n`, `d`, and other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` must contain at least 1 key, `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, `i` is the first key in `d`, and the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2.**
