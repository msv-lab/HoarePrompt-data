The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently the next key in `d`. The values of `n`, `d`, `c`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The specific assignment updates `a1`, but the previous value of `i` is unspecified, just known to represent the next key in `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 0, `a1` is the value of `i`, `a2` remains as it is, `i` is the next key in `d`.**
