Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (ranging from 2 to 100) which indicates the number of card values to be read. It then reads `n` integers (each in the range from 1 to 100), counts the occurrences of each unique integer, and looks for exactly two distinct numbers that appear `n // 2` times. If such two numbers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two numbers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If fewer than two numbers meet the requirement, the function does not return or display any information about those numbers. **
