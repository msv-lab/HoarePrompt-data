The variable `d[i]` is assigned the value `1`. The specific value of `i` is not provided, but it is defined as the second integer in the list `a`, which contains `n` integers, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100. The value of `d` is assumed to be a mutable sequence (like a list or dictionary) capable of storing integers at specified indices. As such, the action modifies the `d` variable at index `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers, and `d[i]` is set to 1.**
