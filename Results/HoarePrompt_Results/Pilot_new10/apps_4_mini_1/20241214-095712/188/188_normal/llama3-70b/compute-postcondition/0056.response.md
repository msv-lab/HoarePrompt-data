In the given code, `print('NO')` is executed. This statement outputs the string `'NO'` but does not alter any variables in the initial state. The variables `n`, `d`, `c`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains all unique integers from the list `a`, `c` indicates the number of integers in `d` that have a count equal to `n // 2` (0, 1, or 2), `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1, or both are -1, and 'NO' has been printed.**
