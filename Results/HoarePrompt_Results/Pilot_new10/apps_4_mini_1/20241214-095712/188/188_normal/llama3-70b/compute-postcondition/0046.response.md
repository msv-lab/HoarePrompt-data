The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, so after the operation, `c` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 1, `a1` is equal to the next key in `d`, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` is the next key in `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 1, `a1` is equal to the next key in `d`, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` is the next key in `d.**
