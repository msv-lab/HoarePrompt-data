The value of `a` is updated by appending an integer obtained from user input. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its previous condition of being an even integer in the range 2 to 100 is still valid. The variable `i` is also unchanged at 1. The impact of the code is that `a` now contains an additional integer element.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is 1, `a` has an additional integer appended from input**.
