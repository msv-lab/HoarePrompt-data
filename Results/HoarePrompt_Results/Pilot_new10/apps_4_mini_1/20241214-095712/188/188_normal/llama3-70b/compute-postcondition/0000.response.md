The value of `n` is assigned to be the integer value of the input, which means `n` will be updated based on what the user inputs. Before the code execution, `n` is an even integer in the range of 2 to 100. After running the code, `n` will now be the input integer value provided by the user, which could potentially be any even integer within that range.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100; `n` is an input integer within that range.**
