Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100 and `d` contains at least 1 more key. If `c` was initially 0, then `c` is updated to 1 and `a1` takes the value of `i`, while `a2` remains unchanged, and `i` moves to the next key in `d`. If `c` was not 0, then `c` remains 0, `a1` remains unchanged, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` moves to the next key in `d`, exiting the most internal loop or if statement.***
