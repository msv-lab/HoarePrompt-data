Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 key, and `c` is 0. If `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, then `c` is set to 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, and `i` remains the first key in `d`. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
