The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts user input and `int` converts that input to an integer. The initial condition states that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100. After executing this code, `n` will be updated with the input value, which remains even and within the specified range. The states of the other variables are not affected, as there are no other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (updated value from input)**
