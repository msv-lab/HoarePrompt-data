The variable `count` is assigned the result of `Counter(cards)`, which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `cards`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it defines the length of the `cards` list but is not directly affected. The `cards` list will still hold `n` integers obtained from input, but we do not know the specific integers or their counts. Thus, `count` will be a dictionary-like object with the counts of each unique integer in `cards`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the occurrences of each integer in `cards`.**
