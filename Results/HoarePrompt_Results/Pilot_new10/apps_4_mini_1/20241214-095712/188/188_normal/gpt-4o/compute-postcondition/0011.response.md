The code snippet provided is a print statement, which outputs a string to the console. The printing of 'NO' does not modify any variables, nor does it impact the variables in any way. The previous state of the variables remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the occurrences of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their occurrences in ascending order; The occurrences of the two most frequent unique numbers in `cards` are not both equal to `n // 2`; and 'NO' has been printed.**
