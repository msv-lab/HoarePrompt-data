Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (with a value between 2 and 100) representing the number of cards, followed by `n` integers (each between 1 and 100) that represent the values on those cards. It checks if there are at least two unique card values and counts their occurrences using a Counter. If the last two unique numbers have the same count equal to `n // 2`, it prints 'YES' along with those two numbers. If there are fewer than two unique numbers or the conditions on the counts are not met, it prints 'NO'. **
