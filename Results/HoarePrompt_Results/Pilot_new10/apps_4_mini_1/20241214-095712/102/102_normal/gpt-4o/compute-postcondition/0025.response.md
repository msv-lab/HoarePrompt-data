Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers, `n`, `a`, and `b`, read from user input. It checks if `n` can be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of `a` and `b` (i.e., `n = x * a + y * b` for non-negative integers `x` and `y`). If a valid combination exists, it prints 'YES' along with values of `x` and `y`. If no valid combination is found after testing all possible values of `x`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values. **
