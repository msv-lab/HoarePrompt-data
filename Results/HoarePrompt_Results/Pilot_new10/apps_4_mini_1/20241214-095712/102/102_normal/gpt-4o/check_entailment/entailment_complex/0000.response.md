Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately follows the problem description for determining whether Vasya can buy non-negative integers of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars such that the total cost equals exactly `n` burles. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads three integers from the user input: `n`, the amount of money Vasya has; `a`, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola; and `b`, the cost of one Bars bar. These inputs satisfy the constraints provided in the problem description.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Values of x**:
   - The program iterates over the possible number of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`) that Vasya can buy, from `0` up to `n // a` (inclusive). This ensures that it checks all feasible non-negative amounts of Ber-Cola that can fit within the budget `n`.

3. **Calculating y**:
   - For each value of `x`, the program checks if the remaining money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola can be evenly spent on Bars bars:
     - It calculates the remaining money as `n - x * a`.
     - The condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0` checks if this remaining amount can be expressed as a non-negative integer multiple of `b` (i.e., the cost of the Bars bars). If this condition holds true, it derives `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`, which will also be a non-negative integer since `n - x * a` is non-negative in that iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid `(x, y)` pair is found that meets the equation \( n = x \cdot a + y \cdot b \), the program prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, the program correctly prints 'NO', aligning with the requirement to indicate that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

5. **Completeness**:
   - The loop exhaustively explores all possible values of `x`â€”starting from `0` up to `n // a`, ensuring that any valid combination of \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \) can be found.

Since the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described, handling edge cases (including the values of `x` and `y` being non-negative and reaching the exact amount of `n`), it fulfills all the requirements laid out in the problem description.
