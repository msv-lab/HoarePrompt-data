`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input value and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous constraints on `a` remain valid, but its specific value will change to the input integer. The value of `b` and `n` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000; `n` is an input integer.**
