In this case, the variable `n` is assigned a value based on user input, which is converted into an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, since `n` is now determined by user input, we represent `n` as an integer based on that input. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000; `n` is an input integer.**
