The `print` statement outputs the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is already defined as 2. The value of `y` is calculated as (n - 2 * a) // b, but since we do not have specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b`, `y` remains an expression dependent on these variables. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer such that `n // a` must be greater than or equal to 2; `x` is 2; `y` is calculated as (n - 2 * a) // b; 'YES' is printed; the values `2` and `y` are printed.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer such that `n // a` must be greater than or equal to 2; `x` is 2; `y` is (n - 2 * a) // b; printed values are 2 and `y`.**
