The code prints the string 'YES'. The values of the variables are not affected by the printing operation, and no computations alter any variables.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer (can be negative); `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `n // b`.**
