Correctness: **False**

The code logic fails in some edge cases. Specifically, it iterates over `x`, which represents the number of bottles of Ber-Cola, and calculates `y` based on the remaining money. However, there can be situations where certain combinations of costs do not get found because it only checks values of `x` starting from 0 up to `n // a`. 

For example, consider the case when:
- `n = 15`
- `a = 6`
- `b = 5`

In this case, the only combinations that fit are:
- `0 bottles of Ber-Cola and 3 Bars bars (3 * 5 = 15)`
- `2 bottles of Ber-Cola and 1 Bars bar (2 * 6 + 1 * 5 = 17)` which is invalid.

However, the program will not find this as it will only check from `0 to 15 // 6 = 2` for `x`, and will see that `x=2` produces more than `n` while `x=1` doesnâ€™t yield a viable `y`. It fails to recognize that `x=0` with `y=3` is actually valid because it computes based on `x` sequentially without checking all possible combinations.

Thus, there exist cases where valid combinations aren't discovered, leading to a false negative result of "NO" when it should report "YES".
