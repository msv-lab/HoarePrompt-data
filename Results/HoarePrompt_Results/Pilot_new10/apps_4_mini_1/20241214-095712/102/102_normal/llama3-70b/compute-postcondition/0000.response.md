The variable `n` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the value of `n` will now be an integer inputted by the user within the range of 1 to 10,000,000. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `n` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000**.
