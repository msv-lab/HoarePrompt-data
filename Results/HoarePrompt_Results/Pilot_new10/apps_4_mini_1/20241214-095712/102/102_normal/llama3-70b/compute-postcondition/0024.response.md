The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values ranging from 1 to 10,000,000. The output behavior of the function is not provided, so we cannot specify how the function transforms or utilizes these input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept explicit parameters, but operates under the constraints that n, a, and b are integers within the range of 1 to 10,000,000. The return value is not specified.**
