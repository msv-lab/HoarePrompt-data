The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not changed by this operation, but we note that the code is terminating. The printed output would have been (2, (n - 2 * a) // b), but since the program exits before any further computations can take place, no results of calculations are returned, and the program execution is halting.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `x` is 2; `y` is (n - 2 * a) // b; program execution has exited.**
