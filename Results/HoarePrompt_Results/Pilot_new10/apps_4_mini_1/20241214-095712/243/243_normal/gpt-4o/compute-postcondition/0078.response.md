According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. In the current state, it is stated that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. 

Since `right` has been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` still equals `m` for the loop to execute one more time. Thus, for the loop to continue, we need to adjust the condition by stating that `func_1(right)` must still equal `m` after the increment.

No other states (like `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`, `left`, and `m`) need to be adjusted based on the given information.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` must equal m and `func_1(right + 1)` must equal m, `right` is equal to the previous value + 1**
