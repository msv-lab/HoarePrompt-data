According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute again, we need `func_1(left)` to equal `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` has been decreased by 1 such that `func_1(left) == m` and `left` is currently greater than or equal to 1.

For the loop to run one more time, the value of `left` needs to still provide that condition. Therefore, we must ensure that after decrementing `left`, the value of `func_1(left)` remains equal to `m`.

To summarize:
1. **`left` must remain such that `func_1(left) == m`**.
2. **`left` also needs to be at least 1 for the loop to continue.**

Since `left` is decreased by 1 in the previous iteration and we need it to continue satisfying its condition, we could require `left` to be at least 2 so that after one more decrement the value still remains valid.

Therefore, the new condition would be that:
- `left` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
