According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left` and the return value of `func_1(left)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`. 

Right before the loop, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` and `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`. Since we know that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, it's possible that `left` can be an appropriate value for the function to return `m`.

To ensure the loop can execute, it would be necessary that `func_1(left)` returns `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `func_1(left)` must return `m`. 

No other states need to be adjusted based on the information provided.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; and `func_1(left) must equal m`**
