The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `m`. `m` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 100,000 \). After executing the function body, it returns a list of integers that fall within the range from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the last index for which `func_1(left) == m` holds true, and `right` is the first index for which `func_1(right) != m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `m` and return a list of integers based on the conditions related to `func_1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `m` and returns a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is defined by `func_1(left) == m` and `right` is defined by `func_1(right) != m`.**
