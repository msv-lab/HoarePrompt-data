The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Knowing that `low` is `0` and `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, we can express `mid` as:

\[ mid = \frac{0 + 5 \times (m + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} \]

The variables `m`, `low`, `high`, and `result` are not altered by this calculation as they retain their original values or types. Therefore, the output state incorporates this calculated value of `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2**
