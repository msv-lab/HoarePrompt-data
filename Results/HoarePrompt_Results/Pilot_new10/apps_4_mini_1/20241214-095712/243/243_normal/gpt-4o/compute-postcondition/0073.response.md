The variable `right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, so `right` is now greater than `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`; and `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.**
