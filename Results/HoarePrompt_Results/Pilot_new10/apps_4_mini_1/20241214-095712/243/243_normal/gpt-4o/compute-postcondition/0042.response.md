To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop condition `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute again, the condition must still hold true after the last iteration.

From the given state:
- `func_1(left)` currently equals `m`, which satisfies the loop's condition.
- The key point is that `left` has been decreased by 1 in the last iteration. This means that for the loop to execute once more, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` after this decrement.

Therefore, we need to ensure that before the decrement, `left` must have been at a value such that `func_1(left - 1) == m` holds true.

Adjusting the variables based on these observations:
1. We just need to state that since `left` has been decreased by 1, `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m` before decrementing `left`.

Thus, we add the condition to reflect that after decreasing, `left` must still be valid relative to `func_1`.

State: **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` must have been such that `func_1(left) == m; left >= 1`**.
