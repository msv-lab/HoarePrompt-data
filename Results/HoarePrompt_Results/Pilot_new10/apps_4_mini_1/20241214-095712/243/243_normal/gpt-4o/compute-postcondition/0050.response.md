To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(right) == m` at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m` after we modify the state.

Currently, we know the following:

1. `right` is currently such that `func_1(right) == m`, which means the condition for the loop is satisfied at the end of the previous iteration.
2. The state indicates `right` has been incremented by 1 (i.e., it is now `right + 1`).

For the loop to execute another time, `func_1(right + 1)` also needs to equal `m`. However, without additional information about the nature of `func_1`, we can't confirm that `func_1(right + 1) == m`. 

Hence, one way to ensure the loop could definitely execute again is to require that `right` was such that `func_1(right + 1)` equals `m` before it was incremented. Since `right` is treated as an exclusive upper boundary, it could have been meant for the next value to also yield `m`.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we can specify the requirement explicitly:

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is incremented by 1 (now `right + 1`), and `func_1(right + 1) must equal m**.
