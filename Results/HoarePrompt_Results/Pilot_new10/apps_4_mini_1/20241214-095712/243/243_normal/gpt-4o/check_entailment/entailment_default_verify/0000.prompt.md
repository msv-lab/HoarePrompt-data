You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to confirm if the code accurately calculates the count of positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. 

Examining the main components of the code:

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` based on the number of factors of 5 present in the numbers leading up to `n`. This is consistent with the mathematical requirement to find trailing zeroes, as trailing zeroes originate from pairs of 2 and 5, and there are typically more 2s than 5s.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**: This is meant to find all integers `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The binary search approach is appropriately applied to locate the point where the number of trailing zeroes matches `m`. The logic for checking numbers below and above the found midpoint is correct, ensuring it collects all integers with the exact count of trailing zeroes.

3. **Output handling**: The output part of the program counts the valid numbers and formats the output as specified.

Checking against potential edge cases:
- For `m = 1`, this program correctly finds that the integers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9` have exactly `1` trailing zero.
- For `m = 5`, the program correctly finds `0` integers which produce exactly `5` trailing zeroes.

However, we can consider a case where `m = 0`. By mathematical convention, `0!` equals `1`, which has zero trailing zeroes. The algorithm should handle this base case to check if there are any `n` that yield a factorial with 0 trailing zeroes.

In summary, the program does handle cases specified in the problem description but does not accommodate the scenario of when `m = 0`. Therefore, for `m = 0`, there should be an output of `1` followed by `0` (since `0!` has 0 trailing zeroes). The program as is will not return this expected output.

Thus, since there is at least one potential case (specifically `m = 0`) where the program does not function correctly as per the problem constraints,

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`. It does this by counting how many times `n` can be divided by powers of 5 until `n` is less than the next power of 5. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a positive integer `m` and returns a list of integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The range of `n` is determined by performing a binary search based on the output of the function `func_1`, which counts the trailing zeroes in `n!`. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
