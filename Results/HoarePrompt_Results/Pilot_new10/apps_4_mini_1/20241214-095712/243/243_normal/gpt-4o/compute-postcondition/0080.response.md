Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` equals `m`, `func_1(right + 1)` equals `m`, and `right` is equal to the original value of `right` plus the number of times the loop executed.**
