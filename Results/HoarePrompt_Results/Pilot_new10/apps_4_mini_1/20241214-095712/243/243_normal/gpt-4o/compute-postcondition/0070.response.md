According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left`, `m`, and the result of `func_1(left)`. The loop can execute again if `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 2`, and we have the condition `func_1(left) must equal m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` after the modifications.

Since we know `func_1(left)` currently equals `m`, we do not need to adjust this state to enable another iteration. However, if `left` changes in a way that affects the outcome of `func_1(left)`, or if `func_1(left)`'s output is not guaranteed to remain equal to `m`, then adjustments may be necessary. But based on the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, all we need is for the function to output `m` again for the loop to continue.

Thus, we need to ensure that the adjustment of `left` does not cause `func_1(left)` to yield a result different than `m`. Since currently `func_1(left)` equals `m`, no other states require adjustment.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 2` and `func_1(left)` is still equal to m**
