The variables `low` and `high` are assigned specific values based on the value of `m`. The value of `low` is set to 0, and `high` is calculated as 5 times (m + 1). Given that `m` is a positive integer and lies between 1 and 100,000, the expression for `high` will evaluate to a specific range based on the minimum and maximum values of `m`. Therefore, `high` will range from 10 (for m=1) to 500,005 (for m=100,000). The value of `low` remains constant.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1)**
