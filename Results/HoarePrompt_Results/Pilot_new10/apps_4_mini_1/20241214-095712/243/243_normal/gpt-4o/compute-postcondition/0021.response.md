Output State: **`left` is decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `right` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1.**
