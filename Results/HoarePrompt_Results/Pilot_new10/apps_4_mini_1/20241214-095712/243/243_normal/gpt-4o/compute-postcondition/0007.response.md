The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, where `mid` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. The previously mentioned conditions for the variables `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, and `zeroes` still hold true. Since `zeroes` is described to be less than `m`, we can state the condition for `low` will remain valid as the updated `low` will be at least one greater than the original `mid`. 

Thus, the Output State will include the updated value of `low`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; the current value of `zeroes` is less than `m`.**
