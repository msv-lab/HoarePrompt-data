The value of `mid` is computed as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, the calculation of `mid` will result in a value that is either equal to or greater than `low` and less than or equal to `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect this calculation.

Output State: **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
