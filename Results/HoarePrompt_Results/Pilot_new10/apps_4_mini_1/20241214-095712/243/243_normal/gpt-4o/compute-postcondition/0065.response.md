`left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and it is determined that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. The states of the other variables (`zeroes` and `result`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
