The variable `right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which means `right` now has a specific value that is one greater than `mid`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `right` is equal to `mid + 1`; the initial value of `left` was at least `1 + number_of_iterations_executed`.**
