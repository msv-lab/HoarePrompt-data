The function `func_1(mid)` is called, and it is expected to return a value that will be assigned to the variable `zeroes`. However, the exact value of `zeroes` is dependent on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided in this initial state. The other variables remain unaffected, and we do not know the specific output of `zeroes`. Therefore, we can denote it as a placeholder. 

The other conditions of the variables remain unchanged after the assignment. Therefore, the output should reflect the previous values and the new assignment.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.**
