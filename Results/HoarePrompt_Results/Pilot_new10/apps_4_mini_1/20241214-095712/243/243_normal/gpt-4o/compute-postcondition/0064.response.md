The code initializes the variable `result` as an empty list. The states of the other variables, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list**.
