The code assigns the value of `mid - 1` to `high`. Given that `mid` is previously defined as (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, we can express the new value of `high`.

1. The previous value of `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1).
2. The `mid` value is calculated as (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2.
3. The assignment changes `high` to be `mid - 1`, so:

   \[
   \text{new value of } high = \left(\frac{5 * (m + 1)}{2}\right) - 1
   \]

Since `zeroes` is given to be greater than or equal to `m` and the current value of `zeroes` is also greater than `m`, no update to `zeroes` or any other variable occurs, only `high` is updated.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 - 1; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m` and the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.**
