The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. The initial state provides the relationships between the variables but does not specify their specific values. However, it indicates that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, meaning that after the increment, `right` will still be greater than or equal to `left`, as both are defined based on the midpoint of `low` and `high`.

Since `right` is incremented but no other variables change or are affected by this operation, the output state should reflect the increment of `right`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` must equal m, `func_1(right + 1)` must equal m, `right` is incremented by 1.**
