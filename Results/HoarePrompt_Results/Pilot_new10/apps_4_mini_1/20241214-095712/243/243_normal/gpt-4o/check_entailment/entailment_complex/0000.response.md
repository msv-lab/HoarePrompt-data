To determine the correctness of the provided Python program relative to the problem description, we need to consider the logic and flow of both functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, as well as the constraints set forth in the problem.

1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials:**
   The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by how many times `n` can be divided by powers of 5 (since factors of 2 are more frequent). Thus, `func_1(n)` correctly counts these trailing zeroes.

2. **Binary Search in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2(m)` implements a binary search mechanism to find the range of `n` for which `n!` yields exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - The search bounds are initialized from `0` to `5 * (m + 1)`, which is a logical estimate since the highest number of trailing zeroes cannot exceed this based on the analysis of trailing zeros.
   - If it finds `zeroes` equal to `m`, it extends both left and right to find the range of `n` values that continue to yield `m` trailing zeros. 

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The annotations and the flow of the functions indicate that if there are no values of `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes, an empty list will be returned, and `0` will be printed.
   - Checking specific outputs from the problem description confirms the behavior of the implementation:
     - For `m = 1`, valid outputs (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) where `n!` has exactly 1 trailing zero are correctly produced.
     - For `m = 5`, the result is an empty list, which aligns with the problem description indicating there are no integers.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   One notable oversight relates to how the function handles the outputs when `m` is zero. Though the original problem states that only positive integers are considered (1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000), if somehow tested with `m = 0` (although not part of the problem constraints), the program would not return any valid values. However, this is not a concern given stated input constraints. 

5. **Conclusion:**
Given how the functions are structured, they fulfill the requirements of finding positive integers `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes, covering both edges of the possible outputs as provided in the examples.

Thus, all provided examples work correctly and there are no cases presented in this problem description that the program fails to handle.

Correctness: **True**
