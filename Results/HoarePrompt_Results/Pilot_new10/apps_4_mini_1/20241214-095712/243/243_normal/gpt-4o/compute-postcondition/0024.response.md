According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right`. The loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `left` has decreased to a point where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, but we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m` for the loop to execute again.

Since it is stated that `right` has been increased by 1, if `func_1(right)` is currently returning a value equal to `m`, then it can continue to execute. If it is not, we need to adjust the variables accordingly.

To ensure that the loop can execute once more, we can maintain that `right` remains such that `func_1(right)` equals `m` after the increment that has already taken place. It may mean that `right` must be decreased back to its previous value or adjusted downwards in case the call to `func_1(right)` returns a value different from `m`.

Thus, adjusting the state to ensure the loop's condition holds would mean we must ensure `func_1(right)` still equals `m`. Since we have no further information on the return of `func_1(right + 1)`, all we know is that it needs to adjust to still meet the condition for the loop to run again.

State: **`left` is decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` must result in `func_1(right)` still being equal to `m`**
