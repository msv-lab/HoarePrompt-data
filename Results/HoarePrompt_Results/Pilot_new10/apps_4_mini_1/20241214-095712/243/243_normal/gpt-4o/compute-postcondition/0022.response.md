According to the code, the loop can only execute if `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`. Currently, we have that `right` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2 + 1. Since `left` is decreased in a way that makes `func_1(left)` not equal to `m`, and there are no adjustments made to `right`, we need to ensure that the condition for the loop to run holds true.

Given that `m` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 100,000, we should determine that for the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Therefore, we must adjust the state so that `right` satisfies the condition that when passed to `func_1`, it produces `m`. 

Since `func_1(right)` currently returns `m`, we do not need to change `right`, but we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` does indeed equal `m`.

State: **`left` is decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
