The `break` statement terminates the nearest enclosing loop. In this case, it indicates that we break out of a loop we might have been executing. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is 1, `count` is such that `count > 5`, `ans` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
