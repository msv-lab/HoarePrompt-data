You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000.
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 1, `count` is such that `5
    n = 1
    ans = []
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        
        ans.append(n)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is `n_final`, `count` is greater than 5, `ans` is a list containing values from 1 to `n_final - 1`.
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `m` from the input (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000), then calculates and prints the count of integers from 1 up to the largest integer `n` such that the division of `n` by powers of 5 is still greater than or equal to `m`. It outputs the count and the list of integers that satisfy this condition, but will not process any input or return any values besides printed output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
