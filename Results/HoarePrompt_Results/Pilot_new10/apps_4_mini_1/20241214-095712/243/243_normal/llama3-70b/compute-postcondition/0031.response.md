The values of the variables do not change because we encounter a `break` statement. This means we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged aside from this logical flow control.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `count` is greater than 5, `ans` is [1, 2] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
