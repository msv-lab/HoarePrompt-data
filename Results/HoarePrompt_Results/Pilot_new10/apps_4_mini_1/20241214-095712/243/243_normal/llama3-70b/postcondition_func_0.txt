The function reads an integer `m` from the input (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000), then calculates and prints the count of integers from 1 up to the largest integer `n` such that the division of `n` by powers of 5 is still greater than or equal to `m`. It outputs the count and the list of integers that satisfy this condition, but will not process any input or return any values besides printed output.
