To determine if the given program is correctly implementing the logic to compare numbers in the "golden system", we need to analyze the provided code and identify if there are any cases where it might fail.

The program reads two binary strings `a` and `b`, converts them from the golden system to decimal using the function `func_1`, and then compares these decimal values, printing the appropriate relationship (`>`, `<`, or `=`) based on the comparison.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` and converts it to its decimal representation using the golden ratio `q = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`. It uses a loop with `enumerate(reversed(s))` to iterate through the characters of the string from the last to the first (which simulates the exponent in the golden system expansion).

2. **Correctness of Conversion:**
   - The function correctly iterates through the string and computes the sum as described by the golden system formula, where each binary digit contributes `a_i * q^(n-i)`.
   - The numerical calculation uses the `q ** i`, which correctly applies the powers of the golden ratio to each bit, regardless of its position in the string.

3. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle leading zeros in the input strings, but this is acceptable since both numbers can be represented regardless of leading zeros. Leading zeros do not contribute to the value of the number in binary/decimal representation and thus do not affect the comparison.
   - Care should be taken with floating-point arithmetic when comparing very large powers of `q`, but since both numbers are processed in the same way and the comparison is relative, precision should not hinder correctness.

4. **Performance:** 
   The function operates in linear time relative to the length of the strings, ensuring it can handle the maximum constraint (100,000 characters) efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Considering the above analysis and the lack of edge cases that would lead to incorrect behavior in the implementation, the function should work as intended for all valid inputs conforming to the problem description.

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
