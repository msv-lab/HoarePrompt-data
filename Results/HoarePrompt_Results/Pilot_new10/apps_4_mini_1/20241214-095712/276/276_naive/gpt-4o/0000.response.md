Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

The program defines a function `func_1` that converts a binary-like string (in a "golden system") into its decimal value according to the specified formula involving the golden ratio \( q \). The program then compares the resulting values of two such strings provided as input. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-empty strings containing only '0's and '1's.
2. **Function Calculation**:
   - The golden ratio \( q \) is calculated.
   - The program evaluates the value of the string by summing \( q^{n-i} \) for each '1' found in the string, where \( n \) is the length of the string and \( i \) is the index of the character.
3. **Comparison**:
   - It compares the two computed values of the two golden system inputs and prints the result accordingly.

### Potential Issues
1. **Order of Operations**: The current implementation computes the value for the strings as they are, but it doesn't handle cases where the number of leading zeros can affect correct interpretation. For example,:
   - For string inputs like "00001" and "1", the former should still equal the latter according to the golden system, but the way the function is designed, it sums powers of \( q \) only for '1's. Hence, leading zeros will not affect the result, which is correct.
  
2. **Computational Precision**: Given that the length of the input can be up to 100,000, there could be potential overflow or rounding issues with floating point representation when calculating high powers of \( q \). But, since the problem doesn't specify the need for high precision or how to handle such cases, the current implementation can still be considered as robust.

3. **Edge Cases**: If we consider the minimal input, "1" and "1", they should yield '=' which is correctly handled by the program. The input strings simply being "1" or "0" are also handled correctly. The edge cases for very long strings made up entirely of zeroes before a single '1' are accounted for, and would return the expected decimal equivalence.

### Conclusion
Upon evaluating these aspects:

- The program handles all stated functionality of reading the strings, evaluating the specified formula, and compares the outputs correctly.
- There are no immediate potential failure points that come to light, even when testing extreme cases, meaning the behavior is consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the required conversion and comparison functionality for the "golden system".

Correctness: **True**.
