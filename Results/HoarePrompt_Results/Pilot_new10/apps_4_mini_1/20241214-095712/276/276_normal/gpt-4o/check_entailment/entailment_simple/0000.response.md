To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's carefully analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Analysis:
1. We need to compare two numbers written in a "golden system" notation, which is represented as strings of '0's and '1's.
2. The value of a string `a_0a_1...a_n` is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{value} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i}
   \]
   where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
3. The output should indicate whether the first number is larger, smaller, or equal to the second number based on their calculated values.

### Program Structure:
1. The program reads two inputs `s1` and `s2`.
2. It calculates the decimal value of each input string using the `func_1` function.
3. It then compares these values and prints:
   - `'>'` if the first value is larger,
   - `'<'` if the first value is smaller,
   - `'='` if they are equal.

### Function `func_1` Implementation:
- The function iterates through the string from left to right and computes the corresponding decimal value by accumulating contributions based on the powers of `q`.
- The power \( q^{n-i-1} \) is computed correctly according to the golden system specification, ensuring that only positions with '1' contribute to the total value.

### Possible Issues:
- The primary consideration is whether the function properly accounts for the sum \( \sum a_i \cdot q^{n-i} \) correctly throughout the string's positions.
- The calculation of \( q \) inside `func_1` ensures that the values are always computed with the necessary precision for comparing two potentially large values derived from long strings (up to 100,000 characters).

### Conclusion:
The provided program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It computes the values based on the golden system correctly and performs the comparison as required. 

Thus, it meets the requirements and handles the potential edge cases (such as leading zeros) correctly since they do not affect the sum being calculated.

Correctness: **True**
