Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements as specified in the problem description. The main issues are as follows:

1. **Incorrect Function Input**: The function `func_1(s)` is meant to accept a single binary string (not a tuple) and calculate its value in the golden system. However, the way it has been described, it seems to imply that `s` is a tuple containing two strings. The function should be processing a single string, yet it appears to be designed as if handling two strings at once.

2. **State After Loop**: The comment states that after the loop, `value` is either approximately 1.618033988749895 or 2.618033988749895 depending on the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]`, as well as suggesting that both being '0' would return 0. This analysis is flawed because it does not reflect the actual value derived from the input binary string; it only accurately accounts for values derived from '1's in a hardcoded manner. 

3. **Assumption of '0' Handling**: The function does not account correctly for cases where the binary strings might contain leading zeros, nor does it correctly apply the logic to calculate decimal equivalents for every input string of length up to 100,000. The expectations in the comments do not expand on how zeros and ones are handled in the context of their positioning, which is crucial in base operations, especially ones involving non-integer bases.

4. **Modeling the Problem**: The comments suggest that the function will return specific known values (e.g., approximately 1.618033988749895) based solely on simple binary patterns of input. This does not conform to any broader cases required by the problem, where it must represent actual sums of `q` raised to various powers based on positions of '1's in the string.

The overall implementation doesn't follow the logic expected from the problem statement, leading to incorrect evaluations and conclusions for inputs that do not fit simple pre-defined scenarios as described in the comments. Thus, the implementation is faulty, failing to ensure that it meets all potentially valid inputs and configurations.
