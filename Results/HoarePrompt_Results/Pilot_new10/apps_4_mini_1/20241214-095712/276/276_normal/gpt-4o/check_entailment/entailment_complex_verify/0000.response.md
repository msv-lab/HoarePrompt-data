After thoroughly reviewing the program, the problem description, and the provided annotations, I reaffirm the original assessment.

The program adheres to the specifications of the problem description by correctly interpreting the "golden system" strings and comparing the computed values based on the formula involving the golden ratio \( q \). The annotations provided confirm that the state of the program is correctly captured at each critical point, specifically before and after the function call, illustrating how the input strings translate into decimal values.

1. **Input Handling**: The program successfully captures the input and processes two strings constructed of '0's and '1's, validating the expectations outlined in the problem description.
  
2. **Function Logic**: The calculation performed within `func_1` correctly implements the required conversion logic, summing up the contributions from each digit in accordance with the specified formula. The annotations clarify that the function is indeed processing a received tuple of two strings, which matches the intended usage.

3. **Comparison**: The comparison logic correctly checks the computed decimal values against each other and outputs the appropriate relation ('>', '<', or '=').

4. **Edge Cases**: The handling of strings with leading zeros is addressed, as the provided logic inherently ignores '0's by not contributing to the sum unless a '1' is encountered.

5. **Floating-Point Precision**: The concern regarding floating-point representations has been noted but does not violate correctness as specified in the input guarantees.

The annotations further specify the expected outcomes derived from computations, confirming that interpretations of the strings are consistent with the problem's stipulations, especially highlighting that the function returns correct values based on the possible inputs.

Thus, it is clear that the program behaves as expected per the problem description, and the annotations support its correctness throughout.

Final: **True**
