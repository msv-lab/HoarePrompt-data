You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value


```
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns a value based on the strings: if both strings are '0', it returns 0; if one string is '1' and the other is '0', it returns approximately 1.618033988749895; if both strings are '1', it returns approximately 2.618033988749895.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
