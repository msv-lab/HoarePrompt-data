#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1' characters, each of which has a length not exceeding 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a tuple of two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1'; `value` is either approximately 1.618033988749895 or 2.618033988749895, depending on the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]` respectively, `q` remains approximately 1.618033988749895, and `n` is 2. If both `s[0]` and `s[1]` are '0', then `value` remains 0.
    return value
    #The program returns either approximately 1.618033988749895 or 2.618033988749895, depending on the values of s[0] and s[1]; if both are '0', then it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns a value based on the strings: if both strings are '0', it returns 0; if one string is '1' and the other is '0', it returns approximately 1.618033988749895; if both strings are '1', it returns approximately 2.618033988749895.
