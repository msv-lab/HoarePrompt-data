The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000. The function processes the binary strings in tuple `s` and returns the converted decimal value based on these strings, where 'i' represents the total number of bits processed minus one. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple of two binary string representations and return their decimal value after conversion. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty binary strings and returns their converted decimal value based on the binary strings.**
