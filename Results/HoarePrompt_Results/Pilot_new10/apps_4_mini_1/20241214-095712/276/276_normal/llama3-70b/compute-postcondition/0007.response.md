To determine the output state based on the provided code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Initial State**:
   - `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings.
   - `decimal` is equal to the previous value of `decimal` plus a calculation involving `int(c) * q`.
   - `i` is equal to `2`.
   - `c` is the second character of the reversed tuple `s`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code updates the `decimal` variable by adding the result of `int(c) * q ** i` to its current value.
   - Given that `i` is `2`, we note that \( q^i = q^2 \).

3. **Effect on Variables**:
   - `c`, being the second character of the reversed tuple `s`, will have a specific value depending on the contents of `s`.
   - The calculation for `decimal` now combines the existing value of `decimal`, the integer value of `c`, and `q` raised to the power of `2`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The value of `decimal` has been updated based on the formula \( \text{decimal} += \text{int}(c) \times q^2 \).
   - The values of `s`, `i`, and `q` remain unchanged.
   - Since `c` depends on `s`, we express `c` in terms of `s`.

Thus, the Output State evaluates to:
Output State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings; `decimal` is equal to the previous value plus `int(c) * q^2; `i` is 2; `c` is the second character of the reversed tuple `s`.**
