Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty binary strings of '0' and '1' characters and converts the first string into its decimal representation using the golden ratio as a base for the conversion. It returns the resulting decimal value. Note that while the function accepts two binary strings, it only processes the first one for conversion; the second string is ignored. **
