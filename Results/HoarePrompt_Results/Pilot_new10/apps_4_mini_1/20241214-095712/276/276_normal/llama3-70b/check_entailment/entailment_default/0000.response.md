The given program is designed to compare two binary strings that represent numbers in the "golden system", using the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \) for conversion to decimal. The function `func_1` processes only the first input string, while the second string is entirely ignored.

Output hints state that while the function accepts a tuple of binary strings, it only processes the first one; thus, if the two input strings differ, the comparison result will be flawed since one string is not being evaluated.

For example, consider the input:
```
0
1
```
In this case, the function will compute the decimal representation of `0`, which will be `0`, and ignore the `1`. The program will conclude that `0 < decimal_b` (where `decimal_b` is the conversion of `1`), which is indeed true. However, if we input:
```
000
111
```
The decimal value for `000` will also be `0`, and the value for `111` will be greater than `0`, resulting in the same incorrect behavior.

Thus, the core flaw lies in the fact that the program fails to process the second string and leads to incorrect comparisons when the two strings differ.

Given that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
