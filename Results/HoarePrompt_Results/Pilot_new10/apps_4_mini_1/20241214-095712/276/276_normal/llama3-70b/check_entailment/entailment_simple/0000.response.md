Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it incorrectly defines the function `func_1`. The function is defined to conduct an operation on a single string `s`, but the input for `func_1` comes from the variable `a` and `b`, which are single strings, not a tuple. This is a significant flaw, as the program does not provide the string as a tuple. Additionally, the lack of proper handling of leading zeros in the strings can cause inconsistencies in the values being compared. 

Specifically, the logic of comparing the decimal values generated from the strings `a` and `b` holds, but the function logic should handle binary string parsing where leading zeros do not affect their execution in golden system calculations (where '00100' and '11' should evaluate to the same value). The code does not explicitly account for converting the golden system representation appropriately nor deduplicates extraneous leading zeros before comparison. 

Moreover, the function `func_1` should have processed each input string as individual inputs without needing to be bundled in a tuple. By taking in a single string, it leads to misunderstanding or improper disaggregation of inputs.

Thus, while the program attempts to meet the problem's requirements, the internal function's design and handling prevent it from being correct for all possible cases.
