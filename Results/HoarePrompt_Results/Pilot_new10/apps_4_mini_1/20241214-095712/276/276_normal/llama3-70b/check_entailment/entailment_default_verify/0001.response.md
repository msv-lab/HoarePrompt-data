The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on its ability to convert two binary strings to their corresponding decimal values in the golden system and compare them accordingly. The assessment highlighted that the function processes the binary strings correctly and that performance considerations do not impede correctness.

However, the provided output hints indicate a significant issue with the implementation of the `func_1` function. Specifically, it states that the function "accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty binary strings" but only processes the first string, ignoring the second. This is a critical flaw because the problem description explicitly requires the program to compare two numbers. By ignoring the second input string, the function would not be able to accurately compare the two numbers as intended. 

Considering this discrepancy, the original assessment that proclaimed the program as correct does not hold true when evaluated against the hints revealing that the second input is ignored. 

Thus, we must conclude that the program does not meet the problem description in its current form. Therefore, I have determined that the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
