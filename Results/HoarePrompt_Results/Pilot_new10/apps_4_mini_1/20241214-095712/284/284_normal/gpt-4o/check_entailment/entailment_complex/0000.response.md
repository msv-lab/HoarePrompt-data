To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program reliably finds a suitable integer `m` such that the expression `n·m + 1` is not a prime number.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` from input, guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000.

2. **Loop Over m**: The program then iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000.

3. **Prime Check**: For each value of `m`, it calculates `n·m + 1` and checks if this value is a prime number using the helper function `func_1`.

4. **Output**: If `func_1` returns `False` (indicating that `n·m + 1` is not prime), the program prints the current value of `m` and exits.

### Correctness of `func_1`:

The function `func_1(x)` checks if `x` is a prime number. It follows standard checks for primality:
- It returns `False` for any number less than or equal to 1.
- It returns `True` for numbers 2 and 3.
- It identifies and returns `False` for any even number or number divisible by 3.
- It checks odd numbers starting from 5 up to the square root of `x` for factors.

### Program Compliance with the Problem Statement:

The problem requests that the program finds at least one `m` (between 1 and 1000) for which `n·m + 1` is not prime. 

The program does the following:
- It will check a range of `m` from 1 up to 1000, which is sufficient given the problem guarantees that at least one counterexample exists for any `n`.
- Given the nature of prime numbers, as `m` increases, it becomes very likely that `n·m + 1` will be composite for some `m`, especially given the wide range available for checking.

For example:
- If `n = 1`, `m = 1` gives `1·1 + 1 = 2` (prime), `m = 2` gives `1·2 + 1 = 3` (prime), `m = 3` gives `1·3 + 1 = 4` (not prime).
- If `n = 3`, `m = 1` gives `3·1 + 1 = 4` (not prime).
- Continue such reasoning for other values.

The assertion that there will always be an `m` for `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000` that satisfies the non-primality requirement is logically sound based on the properties of numbers and the distribution of primes.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic as specified in the problem description. It ensures it checks all necessary values and returns appropriate results according to the hypotheses and the requirements of the problem.

Given this thorough verification, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
