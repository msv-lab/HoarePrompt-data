To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition inside the `while` loop: `i * i <= x`. 

- We know `i` has been increased by 6 in the last iteration. Therefore, we denote the previous value of `i` as `i - 6`.
- We also know that `x` is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to 121 and 25, but not divisible by 11 or 13.

1. **Understanding the loop condition**:
   - The expression `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x` for the loop to execute again.
   - With the current state, `i` has been increased by 6, so we can denote the new value of `i` as `i' = i + 6`.
   
2. **Adjusting the values**:
   - For the loop to execute at least one more time, we want to find conditions on `x`.
   - The condition that needs to hold is:  
     \( (i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq x \)

3. **Considering bounds on `x`**:
   - Since the prior value of `i` could have been any value that satisfies the loop condition previously, we must think in terms of the previous conditions: Here, since `x` must be greater than or equal to \( (i + 6) * (i + 6) \).

Thus, we conclude that the state `x` must be at least \( (i + 6)(i + 6) \).

Given that `n` is provided as a positive integer and we require no adjustments there, we can consolidate our understanding into the state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` must be greater than or equal to (i + 6) * (i + 6)**
