The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer with a value between 1 and 1000 and that `x` is greater than or equal to \((i + 6) \times (i + 6)\). Since `i` is modified but no other variables are affected, we need to account for the increase in `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is greater than or equal to (i + 6) * (i + 6); `i` is increased by 6.**
