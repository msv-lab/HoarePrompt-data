The value of `i` is incremented by 6, changing its previous value from 5 to 11. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as the operation only modifies `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than or equal to 25, `i` is 11, and `x` is not divisible by `i` (11) and `x` is not divisible by `i + 2` (13).**
