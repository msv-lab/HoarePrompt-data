Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by searching for a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.

### Explanation of the Program's Logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 1000) from user input, which is in accordance with the problem requirements.

2. **Looping over \( m \)**: The program enters a for loop where it checks each integer \( m \) from 1 to 1000. This is appropriate because the problem guarantees that there exists an \( m \) in this range such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime.

3. **Checking Primality**: The program uses the `func_1` function to determine if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime. The function follows a methodical approach for checking primality:
   - It first handles base cases (returns False for numbers ≤ 1 and True for numbers ≤ 3).
   - It checks for divisibility by 2 and 3, immediately responding with False for even numbers (except 2) and multiples of 3.
   - It then uses a loop to check divisibility for potential factors starting from 5, incrementing by 6 each time (to skip even numbers).

4. **Finding a Non-prime Result**: If `func_1` returns False (meaning \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime), the program prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement to find a counterexample to the hypothesis that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is always prime.

5. **Guaranteed Output**: The problem statement ensures that a suitable \( m \) exists in the range checked, so the program is guaranteed to produce an output.

### Conclusion:
Since the program adheres strictly to the requirements of the problem description and successfully identifies a value of \( m \) where \( n \cdot m + 1 \) yields a non-prime number, the correctness is affirmed as True.
