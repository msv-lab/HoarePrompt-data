The loop checks for potential factors of `num`, starting from 2 up to the integer value of the square root of `num`. If any factor divides `num` evenly, it returns False, indicating that `num` is not prime.

Given that the loop executes as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`, the final state after all the iterations would be determined by the behavior of the loop.

When the loop terminates, it signifies that all possible divisors up to the square root of `num` have been checked without finding a factor, meaning `num` is prime. 

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` has reached `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, and `num` is a prime number.**
