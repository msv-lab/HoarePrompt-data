The program provided attempts to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis by checking values of the form `n * m + 1` to determine if they are prime. The implementation of this logic, however, has a crucial flaw in the `func_1` function responsible for prime number determination.

The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime by returning `False` for numbers less than 2. However, 1 is explicitly not prime, and the function incorrectly returns `True` for it since it does not handle the edge case of the number being exactly 1. Therefore, if `n * m + 1` evaluates to 1 (which occurs when `n` is 1 and `m` is 1), the program would incorrectly classify it as prime because the function will return `True`.

This oversight means the program could potentially output a value of `m` that leads to a prime number being returned when it should not, thus failing to meet the problem's requirements.

Additionally, the output hints note a critical detail: the function does not accurately differentiate between prime and non-prime numbers for all valid inputs (specifically for the case of 1).

Thus, there exists a clear counterexample:
- For `n = 1` and `m = 1`, `n * m + 1` results in `1`, which should not be identified as prime.

Given this inconsistency, the program does not correctly follow the problem requirements for every potential case as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
