Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to guarantee finding a counterexample for all valid inputs of `n` (specifically, `n = 1` and potentially others). As noted, when `n` is 1, the sequence generated by `n * m + 1` will yield prime numbers for several values of `m`, and the function `func_1` does not accurately handle the scenario where `num = 1`, as it would incorrectly return `True` and indicate a number is prime when it is not. The annotations confirm that the function's logic does not account for all cases effectively, leading to the conclusion that the program does not meet the requirements set out in the problem description. Thus, the program is not correct, and the final judgment remains **False**.
