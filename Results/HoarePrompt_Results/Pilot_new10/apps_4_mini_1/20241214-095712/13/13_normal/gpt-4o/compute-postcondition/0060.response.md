Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `curr_start` is equal to `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is equal to `segments[2][1]`, `segments` remains unchanged, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are the values from `segments[1]`, and `len(segments)` is greater than 2. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the computed length based on the current and previous segments.***
