Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `curr_start` is equal to the start index of the second segment, `curr_end` is equal to the end index of the second segment, `segments` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is the start index of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end index of the first segment. If the difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value or `curr_end - (prev_end + 2) + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.***
