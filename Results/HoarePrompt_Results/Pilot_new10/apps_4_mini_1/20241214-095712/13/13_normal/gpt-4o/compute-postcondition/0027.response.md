The value of `i` is incremented by 1, thus affecting the state of `i`. The initial condition states that `n` is greater than `i`, which remains valid after the increment. There is no change to the value of `trophies[i]` with the provided information. Therefore, after executing the code, we have:

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i` (now incremented by 1)**
