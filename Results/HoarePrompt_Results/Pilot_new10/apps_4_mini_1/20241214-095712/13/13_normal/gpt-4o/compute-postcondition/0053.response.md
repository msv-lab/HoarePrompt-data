Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `curr_start` is equal to the start index of the second segment, `curr_end` is equal to the end index of the second segment, `segments` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is the start index of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end index of the first segment. The current value of `curr_start` minus `prev_end` equals 2.***
