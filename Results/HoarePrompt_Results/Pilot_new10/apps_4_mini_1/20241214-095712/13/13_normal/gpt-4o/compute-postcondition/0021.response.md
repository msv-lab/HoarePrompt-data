The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than the original value of `i`, and `start` is equal to the original value of `i`. Since `i` is being increased by 1, the new value of `i` will be the original value plus 1. The statement about `trophies[i]` still being 'G' is valid as it remains unchanged. 

The variables will now be:
- `i` is the original `i` plus 1.
- `start` remains equal to the original `i`.
- `n` is still greater than the new `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the new `i` (original `i` + 1), `start` is equal to the original `i`, `trophies[i]` must still be 'G'**
