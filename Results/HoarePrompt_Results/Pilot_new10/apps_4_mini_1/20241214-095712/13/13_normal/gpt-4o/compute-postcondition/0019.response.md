The value of `i` is incremented by 1, therefore, `i` must now be `i + 1`. The conditions prior to this operation remain valid after adjusting `i`. `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, `start` remains equal to the original value of `i`, and `trophies[i]` is still 'G' since the changes do not affect this value. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the new `i`, `start` is equal to the original `i`, and trophies[i] must be 'G'.**
