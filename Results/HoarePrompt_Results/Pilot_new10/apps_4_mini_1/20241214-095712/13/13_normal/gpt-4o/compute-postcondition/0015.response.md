Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; if the first character of `trophies` is 'G', then `i` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters at the start of `trophies`, `segments` contains the tuple (0, i - 1), and `trophies` from index 0 to `i-1` consists entirely of 'G'. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and the first character of `trophies` is 'S', while `segments` remains an empty list.***
