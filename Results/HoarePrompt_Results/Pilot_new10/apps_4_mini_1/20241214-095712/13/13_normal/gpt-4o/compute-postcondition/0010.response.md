The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The variable `n` remains greater than 2, and the condition for `trophies[2]` (which must be 'G') remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `trophies[2]` must be 'G', and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `trophies[2]` must be 'G', `i` is increased by 1**
