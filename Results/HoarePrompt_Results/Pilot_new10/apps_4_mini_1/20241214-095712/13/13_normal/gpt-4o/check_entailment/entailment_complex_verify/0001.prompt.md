You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and check for potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis

**Goal:** Maximize the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies (G) after at most one swap.

### Overview of the Program Logic

1. **Segment Finding:** The program first identifies segments of contiguous golden trophies. For instance, from `GGGSGGGSGG`, it extracts segments like `[(0, 2), (4, 6)]`.

2. **Maximum Length Calculation:** The maximum length of golden trophies (`G`) is calculated using:
    - If there's only one segment, that's the maximum length.
    - If there are multiple segments, it checks if two segments can be merged by a single swap (i.e., if they are separated by exactly one silver trophy).

3. **Return Value:** The program computes the longest possible beautiful segment, ensuring that we do not exceed the total number of trophies (`n`).

### Edge Case Considerations

1. **All Silver Trophies:** The program correctly returns `0` if all trophies are silver (`SSS` input).

2. **All Golden Trophies:** For inputs like `GGGG`, no swap is needed, and it correctly returns `4`.

3. **Separation of Segments:** The existing condition checks for more than one segment and correctly computes potential joining via `curr_start - prev_end == 2`.

### Finding Potential Failures

To determine if there’s a case where the program fails, I will consider if there’s a specific situation that would lead to an incorrect assessment of the longest subsegment after a swap.

1. **Example Case:** Let's take `GSGSGG` as a test case.

    - Current segments: `[(0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 5)]` (Lengths: 1, 1, 2).
    - The code would check:
        - Between `0-0` and `2-2`: can't swap.
        - Between `2-2` and `4-5`: no valid segment to consider.

   The code should actually be able to swap `G` from index `0` with `S` from index `1` or `3`, to yield `GGGSGG` which has a longest golden segment of `3`.

The provided implementation would falsely return `2` instead of correctly identifying the longer segment obtainable through swapping. 

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the edge case consideration, it’s evident that the program fails to handle the scenario correctly where segments can lead to longer consolidated golden segments through a swap. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' (for golden trophies) and 'S' (for silver trophies).
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`. If `trophies` consists of any 'G' characters, these tuples are based on the original value of `i`, which identifies the start of each segment of 'G's within the initial string `trophies`. If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will remain an empty list.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating that there are no consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies` since `segments` is an empty list.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`. The list `segments` is not empty, indicating that `trophies` consists of at least one 'G' character.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length calculated from segments, where segments contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in trophies, and the current value of segments has exactly one element.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, `max_length` is the maximum length calculated from segments, and the length of `segments` is not equal to 1.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_length` is the maximum length calculated from the segments given the conditions checked across all consecutive segments in `trophies`, `segments` remains unchanged, and `len(segments)` is greater than 1.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length calculated from the segments and n is another variable that is compared against this result.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `trophies` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. It returns 0 if there are no 'G' characters in the string. If there's only one segment of consecutive 'G' characters, it returns the length of that segment. If there are multiple segments, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive 'G' segments, checks if any two segments are separated by exactly one 'S', and returns the minimum between `max_length + 1` and `n`. This function effectively identifies and evaluates the segments of 'G', handling cases with no 'G's, a single segment of 'G's, and multiple segments efficiently.
