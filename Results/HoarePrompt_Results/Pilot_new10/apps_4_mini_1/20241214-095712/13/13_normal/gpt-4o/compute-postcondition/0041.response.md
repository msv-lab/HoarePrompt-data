Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G' then `i` equals the number of consecutive 'G' trophies starting from the original value of `start`, `trophies[i]` is not 'G', or `i` equals `n`, `segments` now includes the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1.***
