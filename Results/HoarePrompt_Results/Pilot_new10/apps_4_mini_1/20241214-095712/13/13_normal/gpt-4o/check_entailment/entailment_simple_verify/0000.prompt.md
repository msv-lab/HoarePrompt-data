You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation step by step.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- We need to determine the maximum length of a contiguous segment of golden trophies ('G') after performing at most one swap of any two trophies (which can be of either color).
- If there are no golden trophies, the output should be 0.
- The program must handle various cases including all golden trophies, no golden trophies, and configurations where swaps can connect segments of golden trophies.

**Program Analysis:**
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads input and initializes the count of trophies and their arrangement correctly.
2. **Segment Identification**: The implementation correctly identifies segments of 'G' trophies and stores their starting and ending indexes.
3. **Maximum Length Calculation**:
    - The program finds the maximum segment length initially: `max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))`.
    - It also correctly handles the case where there’s only one segment of 'G' trophies by returning that length.
4. **Swapping Logic**: The logic to check if two segments of 'G' can be connected by a swap (i.e., if they are separated by exactly one 'S') is implemented, but the following issues exist:
   - The swap logic only checks for segments that are exactly two positions apart. It doesn't consider cases where a swap might make segments closer if there are multiple 'S' trophies in between, which could lead to different maximum lengths being achievable.
5. **Final Return Statement**: The program returns `min(max_length + 1, n)`, which could lead to incorrect results when there are unswapped segments of 'G' that would form a longer contiguous segment than the calculated maximum.

**Edge Case Example**:
Consider the case where we have:
```
5
GSGSG
```
- The longest segment of 'G' currently is 1 (from either segment).
- A swap between the first 'G' (index 0) and the last 'G' (index 4) does not seem to connect any segments since we only have 'S' in between.
- The program incorrectly suggests that the maximum could be greater simply due to potential swaps.

In summary, while the program works in various scenarios, it does not fully account for the impact of swaps across multiple 'S' between the 'G' segments, leading to potentially incorrect results.

Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the program does not meet the requirement to find the maximum beauty of the arrangement in all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program could output wrong results for cases such as 'GSGSG' as demonstrated, as it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible contiguous 'G' segment after one swap.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' (for golden trophies) and 'S' (for silver trophies).
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`. If `trophies` consists of any 'G' characters, these tuples are based on the original value of `i`, which identifies the start of each segment of 'G's within the initial string `trophies`. If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will remain an empty list.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating that there are no consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies` since `segments` is an empty list.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`. The list `segments` is not empty, indicating that `trophies` consists of at least one 'G' character.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length calculated from segments, where segments contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in trophies, and the current value of segments has exactly one element.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains all tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, `max_length` is the maximum length calculated from segments, and the length of `segments` is not equal to 1.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_length` is the maximum length calculated from the segments given the conditions checked across all consecutive segments in `trophies`, `segments` remains unchanged, and `len(segments)` is greater than 1.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length calculated from the segments and n is another variable that is compared against this result.
