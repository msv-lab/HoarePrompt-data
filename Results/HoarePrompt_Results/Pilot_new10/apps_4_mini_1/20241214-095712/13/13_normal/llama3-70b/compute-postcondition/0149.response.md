`beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `beauty` remains valid, as it is merely updated in the operation. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `j + 1`, and `beauty` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `j + 1`, `beauty` is `beauty + 1`**
