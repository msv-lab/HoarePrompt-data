According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `j` must be initialized correctly. It starts at `i + 2`, so `i` must be set such that `i + 2` is less than `n`. 

Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, `i` should be at least 0 (to avoid situations where `i + 2` exceeds `n`). 

Thus, the condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 2`.

Additionally, at the start of the loop, the variables need to reflect that `j` will start from `i + 2`, and the other parameters (`max_beauty`, `left`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `curr_beauty`, and `beauty`) do not directly impact the loop execution but should be correct as per the given context.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100000, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found (or `n` if none), `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 2`, `j` is now `i + 2`, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `curr_beauty` is the number of 'G's found before hitting a non-'G', `beauty` is the total count of 'G's plus one.**
