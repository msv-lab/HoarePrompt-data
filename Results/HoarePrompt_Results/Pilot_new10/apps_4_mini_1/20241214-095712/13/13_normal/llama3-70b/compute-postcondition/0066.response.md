The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `curr_beauty` is initially 0, after the execution, `curr_beauty` will have the value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S', `j` is `i - 2`.
