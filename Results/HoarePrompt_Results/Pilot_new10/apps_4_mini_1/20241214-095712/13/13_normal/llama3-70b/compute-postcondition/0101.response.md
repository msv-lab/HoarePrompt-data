The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 3, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is -1, and `beauty` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
