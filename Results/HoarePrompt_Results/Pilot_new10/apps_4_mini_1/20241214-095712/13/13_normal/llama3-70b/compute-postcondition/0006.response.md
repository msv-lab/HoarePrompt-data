According to the code, the for loop will execute for each value of `right` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Given that `n` is guaranteed to be within the range of 2 to 100,000, the loop will have at least two iterations (when `n` is 2) and up to 100,000 iterations (when `n` is 100,000). 

The states that need to be considered here are primarily `right`, which will take on values starting from 0 up to `n-1`. Since it's the only variable that will be modified within the for loop (although the loop body is omitted), we need to state that `right` will become 0 before the first execution of the loop. 

Thus, the necessary conditions in the state would be about the initial value of `right` and confirming that `n` is within the specified bounds. 

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 0**
