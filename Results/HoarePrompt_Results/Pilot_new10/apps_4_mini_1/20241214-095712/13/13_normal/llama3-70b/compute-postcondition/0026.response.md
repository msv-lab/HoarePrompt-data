`curr_beauty` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `n`, `right`, and `max_beauty` remain unchanged, while `curr_beauty` is now `0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `right` is 1; `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty` which is now `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `right` is 1; `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty` which is now 0; `curr_beauty` is 0.**
