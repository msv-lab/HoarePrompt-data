Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, and `j` is initialized to `j + 1`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to `beauty + 1`. Otherwise, `beauty` remains as calculated in the previous iteration and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
