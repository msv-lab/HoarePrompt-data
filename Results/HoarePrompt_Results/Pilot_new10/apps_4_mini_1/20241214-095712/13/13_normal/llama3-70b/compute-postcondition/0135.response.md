The code contains a `break` statement, which does not change any variable values. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or statement context we were in. Thus, no variables are modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `beauty` is 2 if the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', otherwise `beauty` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
