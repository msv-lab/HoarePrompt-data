Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `right` is 1. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is increased by 1. If `s[right]` is not 'G', `left` is the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` and remains unchanged. If `left` is less than `right`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, which equals 1. It is ensured that `s[left]` is 'G' if `left` is less than `n`, or `left` equals `n` if 'G' is not present, under the guarantee that `left` is less than `right`.***
