The variable `beauty` is assigned the value of `1`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of the variables reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G' while the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S'; `beauty` is 1**.
