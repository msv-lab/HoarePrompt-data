To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute based on the provided state and for loop, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop runs.

1. The loop is structured as `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)`. 
2. The loop starts at `i - 1` and decrements `j` until `-1` (exclusive).
3. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. 

Given that `i` is defined as `n - 2`, we can substitute:
- If `i = n - 2`, then `i - 1 = n - 3`.

For the loop's starting point `n - 3` to be valid:
- We need `n - 3 >= 0`, which simplifies to `n >= 3`.

From the initial state:
- The state mentions that `n` is an integer between `2` and `100000`, meaning `n` could potentially be `2`, which would make `i` equal to `0` (and hence the loop would not execute). 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need `n` to be at least `3`. 

Additionally, we know:
- `i = n - 2`, which, for valid execution, we established should allow `j` to start at `n - 3` (this translates to at least `j = 0`).

Thus, the required adjustments to the state would be:
- `n` must be at least `3`.
- `i` will equal `1` when `n` is `3`, and `j` will start from `1 - 1 = 0`.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is 0, `beauty` is 1**
