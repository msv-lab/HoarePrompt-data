According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 2` and runs until it is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 2 and 100000, and `j` is currently set to `i + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Thus, we need to increment `j` by 1. The updated value of `j` will be `i + 3`.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be updated to reflect that `j` is now `i + 3`, and `n` remains between 2 and 100000. 

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100000, `j` is `i + 3`**
