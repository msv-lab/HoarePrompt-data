Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `j` is less than `n`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G' characters found from index `i + 2` to the end of `s`, incremented by the number of consecutive 'G's before breaking, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.***
