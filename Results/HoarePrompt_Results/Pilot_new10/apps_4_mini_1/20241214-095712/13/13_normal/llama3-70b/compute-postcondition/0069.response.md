According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `j` is currently set to `i - 1`, and since the loop iterates backward from that point, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

Therefore, if `j` is currently `i - 1`, it will need to be `i - 2` for the next iteration, and the condition for continuing the loop requires that `j` remains greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `curr_beauty` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', else `curr_beauty` remains 0, and `j` is `i - 2`**
