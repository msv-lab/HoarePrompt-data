The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `left` is 3, so after the execution, `left` becomes 4. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `right` must be greater than 3; `max_beauty` is updated; `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` is 4; `s[left]` must not be 'G'.
