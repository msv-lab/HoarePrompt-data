According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i + 2 < n`. Given that `i` is equal to `n - 2`, we can deduce:

- The expression `i + 2` evaluates to `n`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need `j` to be initialized properly. However, since `j` starts below `0`, it will increment starting from `0` onwards until it reaches `i + 1`, which contains `n - 1` at maximum. This means the loop can run at least once.

To summarize the necessary states:

1. `n` must be between 2 and 100000, thus it satisfies the upper boundary.
2. `i` is `n - 2`, so it satisfies `i + 2 == n`.
3. `j` starts at `i + 2` (which is `n`), and hence `j` will start from a value equal to `n`, thus it is positioned to reference a valid index in the loop.
4. The `beauty` needs not adjustment since it counts based on the string `s` and its latest state.

Nonetheless, since `j` being initially less than `0` is illogical in this context, provided the constraints, it should be adjusted to be `0` at the start of the loop to align with typical looping behavior and avoid any invalid index reference.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to 0, `beauty` is equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the end of the `s` string up to index `i`**.
