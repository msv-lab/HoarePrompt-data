According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. The loop condition indicates that the loop can execute again if `left` is less than `right` and the character at index `left` in `s` is not 'G'. 

At the end of the last iteration, `right` equals 0 and `left` also equals 0. Since `left < right` is a requirement for the loop to execute again, this condition is not met; thus, `left` must be adjusted. Given that `s[left]` must not be 'G' and currently `left` is 0, for the loop to execute at least one more time, `right` needs to be increased to ensure that `left` can be compared against it.

To keep it simple yet ensure the loop condition is satisfied, let's adjust `right`. Since `right` must be greater than `left`, it needs to be set to at least 1, given the current state of `left` is 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` must be greater than 0, `left` is 0, the character at index `left` in `s` must not be 'G', `max_beauty` is either unchanged or equal to `max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`, `curr_beauty` is 0**
