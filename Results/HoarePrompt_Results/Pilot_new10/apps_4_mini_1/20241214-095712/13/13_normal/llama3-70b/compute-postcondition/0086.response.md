The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Since `break` interrupts execution, the overall state remains the same regarding the variable `j`, which is still dependent on `i`. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100000, and `j` is still `i + 4`, while we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100000, `j` is `i + 4` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
