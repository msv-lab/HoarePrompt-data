To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the conditions and behavior of the loop based on the provided code.

Here is the information derived from the iterations of the loop:

- Initially, `left` is less than `right`, with the condition specifying that `s[left]` should not be 'G'.
- With each iteration, `left` is incremented until either `left` is no longer less than `right`, or the character at `s[left]` is 'G'.

Now, we can summarize the possible final outcomes based on the conditions that must be met for the loop to run at all:

1. When `left` reaches `right`, the loop will end.
2. `s[left]` must not be 'G' for the loop to continue.

After the loop terminates:
- The value of `left` will be equal to `right` if `s[left]` was not 'G' up to `right`, or will stop at the first index where `s[left]` = 'G'.
- If no 'G' was found before reaching the index `right`, then `left` will be equal to `right`, meaning `left` is now `right` (that was initialized at 0).
- The condition implies that `right` is unchanged (or 0) and does not affect `max_beauty` or `curr_beauty` after the operation.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed will be detailed as:

Output State: **`left` is equal to `right`, `right` is 0, the character at index `left` in `s` may be 'G' or not, `max_beauty` remains either unchanged or equal to `max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`, `curr_beauty` is 0.**
