The code outputs the maximum of two values: `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. Since the initial state did not specify specific values for `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`, and they remain unchanged in this snippet, we can only note their relationship. The other variables are unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty value calculated from the string for all eligible 'G' and 'S' pairs encountered; `curr_beauty` remains 0; `left` is unchanged from its initial value reflecting the first 'G' found or `n` if none found; `beauty` is the count of 'G's that can be formed by making at most one swap with an 'S' adjacent to any 'G' found during the iterations; output is max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap).**
