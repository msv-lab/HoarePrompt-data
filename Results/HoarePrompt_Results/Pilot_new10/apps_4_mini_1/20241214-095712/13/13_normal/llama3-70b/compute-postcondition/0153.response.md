The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, as their values are not directly affected by this operation. The initial state of `beauty` is previously calculated and remains relevant as it was not defined in specific terms in the current context. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `i` is less than `n - 2`; `j` is equal to `current_j + 1`; `beauty` is previously calculated plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `i` is less than `n - 2`; `j` is equal to `current_j + 1`; `beauty` is previously calculated + 1.**
