The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that should be an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\). However, without knowing the specific input, we cannot determine the exact value for `n` after this assignment. The string representing trophies is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.**
