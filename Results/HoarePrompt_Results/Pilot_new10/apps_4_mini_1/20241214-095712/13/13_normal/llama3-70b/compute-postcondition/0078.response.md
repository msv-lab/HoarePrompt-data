Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100000, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found (or `n` if none), `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 2`, `j` is now `i + 2`, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `curr_beauty` is the number of 'G's found before hitting a non-'G', `beauty` is the total count of 'G's plus one, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
