Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), and `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is set to 1. Otherwise, `curr_beauty` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
