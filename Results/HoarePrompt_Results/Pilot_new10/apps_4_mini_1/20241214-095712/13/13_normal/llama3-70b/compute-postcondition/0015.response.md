The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation, and their states remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 0, `left` is 0, the character at index `left` in `s` must not be 'G', `max_beauty` is either unchanged or equal to `max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`, `curr_beauty` is 0.
