To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop based on the initial state and the provided code, we consider the conditions necessary for the loop to execute fully and how the variables change after the loop runs.

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is less than 0, and `beauty` is equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the end of the `s` string up to index `i`, which could vary from 1 to `i + 1` depending on the content of the string `s`.

In the loop:
```
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```

For the loop to execute all iterations (from `j = i + 2` to `j < n`), it requires that all characters `s[j]` for `j` in that range are equal to 'G'. The loop will increment `beauty` for each 'G' found until it encounters a non-'G', at which point it will break out of the loop.

Given that `i = n - 2`, the range for `j` would thus start from `n - 2 + 2 = n` to `n`, meaning the loop can execute for `j` values from `n` would not continue because the range is invalid.

If `j` does not increment and remains uninitialized, the loop will not execute at all (if `s` has lesser length than `j`).

If `s` ends with a series of 'G's leading to `j` values where all checks are 'G', `beauty` will simply count those 'G'.

Output State after the loop completes:
- If the string `s` has 'G's up to the end of the specified range, `beauty` will represent the count of those 'G's added to the initial count from the last segment.
- If the character at `s[j]` (where `j` starts from `i + 2`) is not 'G' (or the loop doesn't execute), `j` will not increment, and the `beauty` will remain at its last value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 2`; `j` is less than `n`; `beauty` is equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the end of the `s` string starting from index `i + 2` onwards, incremented by the number of consecutive 'G's found, if they exist before breaking. If no iterations occurred, `beauty` equals its initial value.**
