To determine the adjustments needed to ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we analyze the loop's conditions. The loop's continuation depends on two factors: `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.

1. **Condition 1: `left < right`**  
   - At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 3 and `right` is 1. Here, the condition `left < right` is false (3 is not less than 1). For the loop to execute again, we need to adjust `right` such that it is greater than `left`. Therefore, `right` must be at least 4 to satisfy the condition.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != 'G'`**  
   - The condition `s[left] != 'G'` requires that `s[3]` is not 'G'. This condition may already be satisfied, so no adjustments are required here as long as `s[3]` remains not equal to 'G'.

In conclusion, the adjustments needed are to ensure that `right` is greater than `left`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `right` must be greater than 3; `max_beauty` is updated; `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` is 3; `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
