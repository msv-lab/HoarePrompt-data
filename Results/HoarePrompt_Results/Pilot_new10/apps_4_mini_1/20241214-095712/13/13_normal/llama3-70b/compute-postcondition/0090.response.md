Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `beauty` is the total count of 'G's found in the string plus one, `curr_beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found after index `i`, `j` is equal to `n` if no further 'G's are present beyond `i + 1`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.***
