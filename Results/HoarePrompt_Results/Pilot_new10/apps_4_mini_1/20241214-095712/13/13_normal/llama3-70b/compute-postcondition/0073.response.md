To analyze the final output state after the loop has executed fully, we need to consider the loop's mechanics and the specified initial conditions.

Given the loop:
```
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```

The loop will continue executing as long as it encounters 'G' characters in the string `s` when counting backward from index `i-1`. If it finds a character that is not 'G', the loop will terminate.

Based on the output states provided after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we note the following:

1. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 0 and the character at index `i` must be 'G' with `s[i + 1]` being 'S'.
2. `beauty` is initialized to 1 (when entering the loop), and it will increase with every 'G' found in the backward iteration.
3. The loop continues until a non-'G' character is found or until the beginning of the string is reached.

To determine the final output state after all iterations:
- If there are `x` consecutive 'G's up to but not including the first non-'G' character that precedes the index `i`, the final value of `beauty` would be `1 + x` because it starts from `1` (the value initialized at the start of the loop).
- If no 'G's are found before encountering a non-'G', the loop would terminate almost immediately, and `beauty` would remain `1`.
- If `i` is at a position where all preceding characters (up to index `0`) are 'G', then the loop will iterate until the beginning of the string. Thus, `beauty` will reflect the total count of 'G's found plus the initial `1`.

Considering these points:

- If there are no 'G's preceding index `i`, then `beauty` remains `1`.
- If there are `x` 'G's, then `beauty` would be `1 + x`.

Assuming `left` can be `n` when none are found (for cases like 'S' followed directly), the loop's output state will account for all `G`s present before the `S`.

Thus, the final output state when the loop has run completely will be based on how many 'G's were found:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `max_beauty` is unchanged; `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found); `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0; `curr_beauty` is the number of 'G's found before hitting a non-'G', and `beauty` is the total count of 'G's plus one.**
