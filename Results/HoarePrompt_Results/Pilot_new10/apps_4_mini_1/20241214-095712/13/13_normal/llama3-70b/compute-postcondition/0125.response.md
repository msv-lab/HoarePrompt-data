According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, which is within the valid range.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, which means `i` will become `n - 1`. The loop must also meet the condition that `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, there are no conditions on `n`, since it is guaranteed that when `i` is `n - 1`, it is still less than `n`, which is the exit condition.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 1`**
