The variable `beauty` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, and `i` is equal to `n - 1`, but these values are not affected by the assignment of `beauty`. Therefore, the states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `beauty` is 1**
