The code increments the variable `left` by 1. The initial value of `left` is 2, so after the execution of `left += 1`, the new value of `left` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged in their current states. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `right` is 1; `max_beauty` is updated; `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` is 3; `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
