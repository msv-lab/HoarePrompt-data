The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous state mentions nothing about `beauty`, so it is assumed to be an integer. The other variables, `n`, `i`, and `j`, remain unchanged as the code only affects `beauty`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `beauty` is incremented by 1.**
