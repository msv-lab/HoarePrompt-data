According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j`. The loop starts from `i - 1` and decrements `j` until it reaches -1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, which means the current value of `j` was `i - 1`, or `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must decrement to `n - 3`. 

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, and `j` was `n - 2`, after one more iteration, `j` will be `n - 3`. 

Regarding `beauty`, it will still depend on the character at index `j`. If `j` is `n - 3`, and if the character at that index is 'G', then `beauty` would be 2. However, if it is not 'G', then `beauty` remains 1, and similarly, the program could break out of the internal loop.

Thus, to ensure we reflect the necessary changes for the next iteration, the relevant states would be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `beauty` is 2 if the character at index `j` (which is now `n - 3`) of `s` is 'G'. If the character at index `j` is not 'G', then `beauty` remains 1.**
