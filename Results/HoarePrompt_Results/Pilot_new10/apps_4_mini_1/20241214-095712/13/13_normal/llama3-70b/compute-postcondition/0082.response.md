The value of the variables does not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The specific values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100000, `j` is `i + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
