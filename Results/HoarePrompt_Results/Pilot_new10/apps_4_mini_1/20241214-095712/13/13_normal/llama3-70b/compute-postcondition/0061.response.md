The variable `beauty` is increased by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged or unaffected. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state, with the only modification being the updated value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S', and the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G'; `beauty` is 2.**
