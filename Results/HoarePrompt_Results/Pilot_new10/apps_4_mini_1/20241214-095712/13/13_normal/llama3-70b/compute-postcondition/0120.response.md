The code contains a `break` statement, which causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or control structure that it is inside. Since no values of `n`, `i`, or `j` are modified through the execution of this `break`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current values of `n`, `i`, and `j` along with the action of breaking out of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
