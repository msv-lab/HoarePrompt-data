`curr_beauty` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 0, the character at index `right` in `s` is not 'G', `max_beauty` is either unchanged or equal to `max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`, and `curr_beauty` is 0.
