The function prompts the user to input a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and then calculates and prints a value based on the bit length of `n`. Specifically, it computes the result using the formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`, which effectively computes a certain value related to the binary representation of `n`, but does not return any value; it only prints the result.
