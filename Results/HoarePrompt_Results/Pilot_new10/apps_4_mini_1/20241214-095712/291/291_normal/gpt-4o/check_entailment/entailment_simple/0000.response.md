To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program step by step.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of squares Sofia wants to draw. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Core Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to minimize the number of segments needed to draw `n` squares.
   - It iterates through possible values of `a` from 1 up to the square root of `n`. For each `a`, it calculates the corresponding `b` required to fit `n` squares. The calculation `b = (n + a - 1) // a` effectively computes the number of rows needed if `a` squares are positioned horizontally in a grid layout.
   - It then calculates the total number of segments needed to draw the squares as `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)`. This counts the vertical and horizontal segments needed based on the arrangement of squares.

3. **Minimization**:
   - The program maintains `min_segments_needed`, which is updated to the minimum value found in the iterations. This ensures that at the end of the iterations, the function returns the least number of segments needed to draw the squares utilizing the guiding segments rule.

### Verification with the Problem Description
- Based on the problem description, the minimal number of segments drawn with a ruler for drawing `n` squares is computed based on the layout of squares. The logic used to derive `a` and `b` and the total segments required correctly simulates the situation described in the problem. 

- The condition of minimizing the drawn segments while maximizing the use of guide segments is correctly implemented since the program is iterating through possible rectangle dimensions (`a` x `b`) to find the least possible drawn segments.

### Cases to Consider
- Let's validate with edge cases:
  - For `n = 1`: 
    - `a = 1`, then `b = 1`, hence `segments_needed = 2 * (1 + 1) = 4`. However, Sofia will almost always need only 2 segments to form a single square, which is a discrepancy.
  - For larger values (`n = 2`, `n = 4`): 
    - The function will similarly yield results that can logically correspond to combinations of squares drawn efficiently through guiding segments.

### Conclusion
The program effectively targets minimizing segments according to Sofia's drawing method. However, the calculation of segments may not always correspond to the examples provided, as observed for small `n`, particularly `n = 1`, where the calculated result is more than what's mentioned.

Therefore, the logic fails to completely capture the essence of drawing squares in the specified manner, leading to potential inaccuracies regarding the number of segments.

**Correctness: False**
