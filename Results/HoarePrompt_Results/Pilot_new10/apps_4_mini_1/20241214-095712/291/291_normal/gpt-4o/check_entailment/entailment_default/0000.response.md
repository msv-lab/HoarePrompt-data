The program provided is aimed at finding the minimum number of segments that Sofia has to draw with a ruler when drawing `n` squares on a grid. Let's analyze the functionality of the code.

The function `func_1(n)` iterates values of `a` from 1 up to the integer square root of `n`. For each value of `a`, it calculates the corresponding value of `b` such that `a*b` is at least `n`. The total number of segments needed is computed as `2 * (a + b)`. It tracks the minimum segments needed across the iterations.

Now, let's look at a couple of cases based on the given problem description and verify if the function returns the expected results:

1. **For `n = 1`:**
   - Given 1 square, we need 2 segments. The program calculates:
     - For `a = 1`, `b = (1 + 1 - 1) // 1 = 1`. Thus, segments_needed = `2 * (1 + 1) = 4`.
   - The minimum is supposed to lead back to the correct result, which should yield 2 segments. The output is incorrect here for case `n=1`.

2. **For `n = 2`:**
   - Given 2 squares, the expected output is 3 segments. The function follows:
     - For `a = 1`, `b = 2` -> segments_needed = `2 * (1 + 2) = 6`.
     - For `a = 2`, `b = 1` -> segments_needed = `2 * (2 + 1) = 6`.
   - So again, it yields a min of 6 segments which is incorrect for case `n=2`.

3. **For `n = 4`:**
   - Given 4 squares, the required segments are 4. The checks:
     - For `a = 1`, `b = 4` -> segments_needed = `2 * (1 + 4) = 10`.
     - For `a = 2`, `b = 2` -> segments_needed = `2 * (2 + 2) = 8`.
     - For `a = 3`, `b` becomes `2` -> segments_needed = `10`.
     - For `a = 4`, `b = 1` -> segments_needed = `10`.
   - Yet all return values yield 10 segments, failing for `n=4`.

This analysis shows that the code doesn't correctly handle the computation of segments needed and fails for various values of `n`.

The output hints mention that the return value reflects the number of segments needed, which aligns with the program's output, but upon checking specific cases that emerge from the problem description, the function does not give the correct minimum segments needed for several inputs.

Thus, since the function does not consistently and correctly yield the expected results as per the example cases described in the problem, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.
