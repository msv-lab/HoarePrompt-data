Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of segments needed to draw `n` squares. Specifically, the program aims to optimize the arrangement of squares in a rectangular grid, minimizing segments. However, it fails to account for the correct counting of segments required based on the relationship between the number of squares and the required segments.

For example, when `n = 4`, the correct output should be `4`, since Sofia can draw the four segments of one square and then use the segments as guides for the next square. However, the logic in `func_1` does not produce the correct result because it calculates an optimal rectangle size without ensuring that it reflects how segments from other squares will provide guides effectively.

Analyzing specific test cases:
- For `n = 1`, the program outputs `2` (correct).
- For `n = 2`, the program outputs `3` (correct).
- For `n = 3`, the program outputs `4` (incorrect, should be `4`).
- For `n = 4`, the program outputs `4` (correct).

The program does not correctly handle certain cases based on the insights outlined in the problem description. It fails to provide a correct solution for cases beyond simple scenarios, leading to inconsistencies in the output when considering practical arrangements of squares. 

Thus, due to its failure to provide the correct number of segments required for certain configurations, I declare the program incorrect.
