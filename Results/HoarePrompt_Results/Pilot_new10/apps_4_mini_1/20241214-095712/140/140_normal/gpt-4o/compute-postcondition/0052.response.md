Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]`, `queue`, `count`, `graph[node]`, and `node` are related such that if `in_degree[neighbor]` was decreased by 1 and it equals 0, then `queue` includes the neighbor, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` has at least one neighbor, and `node` is assigned the value of the first element from the original `queue`.***
