The operation `queue.append(neighbor)` appends `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. The variables that are affected by this operation are only `queue`. The previously noted conditions indicate that `in_degree[neighbor]` was decreased by 1 and was equal to 0 before the append operation, which implies that `neighbor` is now ready to be processed. 

Now the state of `queue` will reflect that it has one more element added (the `neighbor`), while other mentioned states remain unchanged since they are not altered by this specific operation. 

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `queue` has one more element (neighbor), `count` has increased by 1, `graph[node]` has at least one neighbor, `node` is assigned the value of the first element of the original `queue`, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.**
