The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (from 1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices. The parameter `n` is an integer that represents the number of vertices in the graph, adhering to the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. After executing the function body, the program returns whether the count of processed nodes is not equal to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `has_cycle` is to accept a dictionary representing a directed graph and return a boolean indicating if there exists a cycle in the graph based on the number of processed nodes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter graph, which is a dictionary representing a directed graph, and returns whether the count of processed nodes is not equal to the number of vertices n, indicating the presence of a cycle in the graph.**
