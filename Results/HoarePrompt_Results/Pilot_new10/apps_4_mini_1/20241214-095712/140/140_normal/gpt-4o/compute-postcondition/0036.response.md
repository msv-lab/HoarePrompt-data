According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `graph[node]`. For the loop to iterate once more, there must be at least one more `neighbor` in `graph[node]` that has not been considered yet. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `in_degree` must contain at least one key with a value greater than or equal to -1, `count` was increased by 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is now -1, and since `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0, `queue` contains the previously existing elements plus this newly appended `neighbor`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor that hasn't been dealt with in the iterations so far. If this neighbor is the next one in the sequence, we can assume the following states should be adjusted: the `neighbor` will need to be changed to the next element in `graph[node]` that has not yet been processed.

State: **`in_degree` must contain at least one key with value greater than or equal to -1, `queue` has the previously existing elements plus the newly appended `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` continues to have at least one more neighbor**.
