The function accepts a dictionary representing a directed graph, counts the number of vertices that have been processed by performing a breadth-first search starting from nodes with no incoming edges, and returns `True` if not all vertices can be reached (indicating the presence of a cycle), or `False` if all vertices are reachable (indicating no cycle).
