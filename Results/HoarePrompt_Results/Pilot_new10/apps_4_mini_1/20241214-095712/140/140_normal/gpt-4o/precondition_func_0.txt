n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) consists of two integers representing a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
