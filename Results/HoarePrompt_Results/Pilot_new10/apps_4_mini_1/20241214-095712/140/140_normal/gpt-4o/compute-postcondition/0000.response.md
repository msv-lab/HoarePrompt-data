The code initializes the `in_degree` dictionary, where each key corresponds to a vertex in the graph (from 1 to n), and the corresponding value is set to 0. This represents the in-degrees of all vertices in the directed graph, which starts at 0 since no edges have been processed yet. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and the `in_degree` values have been populated based on the number of vertices `n`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to n and values are lists of directed edges; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to n has a value of 0.**
