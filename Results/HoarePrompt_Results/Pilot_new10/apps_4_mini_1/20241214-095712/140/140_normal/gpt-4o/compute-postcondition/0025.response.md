Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where each key has a value representing the total number of incoming edges for each vertex based on the edges in `graph`, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, and every vertex in `graph` has its outgoing edges properly accounted for in the corresponding values of `in_degree`.**
