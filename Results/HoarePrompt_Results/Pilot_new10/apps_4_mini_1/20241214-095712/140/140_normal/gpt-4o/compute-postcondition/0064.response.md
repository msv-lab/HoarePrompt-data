The variable `count` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables, `in_degree`, `queue`, `graph[node]`, and `node`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degree counts for each neighbor, `queue` has one less neighbor than before, `count` is now increased by 1, `graph[node]` represents the neighbors of the current `node`, and `node` is now assigned the value of the element that was popped from `queue`.
