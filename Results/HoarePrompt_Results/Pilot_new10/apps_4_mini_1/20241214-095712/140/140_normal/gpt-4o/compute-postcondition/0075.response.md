Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 and must be at least -1, `queue` has an additional neighbor which is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in the list, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is now `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`.**
