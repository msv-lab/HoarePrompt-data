In the given code snippet, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. It is mentioned that `in_degree` values are 0 for all keys except `v`, which is currently 2. Therefore, after executing the line of code, the `in_degree` value for `v` will change from 2 to 3.

The state of the other variables remains unaffected, so `graph` remains a dictionary with keys 1 to n, `u` remains 1, and `v` is still the second vertex in `graph[1]` and `v’` is the third vertex in `graph[1]`.

The Output State reflects these changes:

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys 1 to n, `in_degree` values are 0 for all keys except `v`, which is now 3, `u` is 1, and `v` is the second vertex in `graph[1]`, `v’` is the third vertex in `graph[1]`.**
