Correctness: **False**

The annotated program attempts to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, the implementation only checks if the graph is currently acyclic. If a cycle is detected, it directly returns "NO", without considering the possibility of breaking the cycle by removing a single edge. 

This is crucial as there are cases where a directed graph may have cycles, yet can be converted to an acyclic graph by removing just one edge. For instance, consider a simple graph with edges (1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 2). This graph contains a cycle (2 -> 3 -> 2) but can be made acyclic by removing the edge 2 -> 3.

Moreover, the program does not explore all possible edges that could be removed to ascertain if the graph could be rendered acyclic. A correct implementation would require a more comprehensive approach that checks potential removals of edges whenever a cycle is detected to confirm if the removal of such an edge would break the cycle.

This failure to check and account for the scenarios described in the problem means the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is false.
