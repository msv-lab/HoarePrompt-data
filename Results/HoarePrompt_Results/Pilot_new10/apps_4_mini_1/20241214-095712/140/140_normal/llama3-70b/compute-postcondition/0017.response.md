Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing the current node, and `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor. If `neighbor` has not been visited, and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, this indicates that the current node has one or more unvisited neighbors in the graph. Otherwise, if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that there is at least one more neighbor to iterate over in `graph[node]`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False, there is no specific return value.***
