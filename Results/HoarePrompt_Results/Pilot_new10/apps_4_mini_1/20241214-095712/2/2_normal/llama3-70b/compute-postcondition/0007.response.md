`max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The previous value of `max_num` was 0, and `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state retains information about the previous values of the other variables as they do not change. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 1, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
