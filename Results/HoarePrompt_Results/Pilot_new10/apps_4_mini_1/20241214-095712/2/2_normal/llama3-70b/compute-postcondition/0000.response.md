The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The new value of `x` will replace the previous value, but since we do not have the specific input provided, its value remains unspecified but is still bound by the constraint 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer that is positive and still within the range 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18**
