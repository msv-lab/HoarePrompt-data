The variable `max_num` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `x` and `max_sum` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0; `max_num` is 0.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0; `max_num` is 0**.
