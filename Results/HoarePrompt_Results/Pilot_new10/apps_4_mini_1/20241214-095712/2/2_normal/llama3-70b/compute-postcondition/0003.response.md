According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `x`. The loop iterates from `1` to `x`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `x` must be at least `1`. The initial values of `max_sum` and `max_num` do not affect whether the loop executes; however, after the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `x + 1` which is `x + 1` after the loop finishes execution. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed:
- `x` must be at least 1.
- `i` will start at 1.

State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1**
