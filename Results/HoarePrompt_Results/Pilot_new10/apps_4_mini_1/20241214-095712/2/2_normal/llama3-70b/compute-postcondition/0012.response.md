The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is 2, so `max_num` is updated to 2 as well. The values of `x`, `max_sum`, `digit_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2**
