The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The value of `digit_sum` is 2, so `max_sum` will now be equal to 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `max_sum` is now 2, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is 2.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2**
