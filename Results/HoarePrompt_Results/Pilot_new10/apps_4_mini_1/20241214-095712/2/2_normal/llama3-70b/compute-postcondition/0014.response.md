According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have that `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to 2, `max_num` is updated to 2, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is also equal to 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3**
