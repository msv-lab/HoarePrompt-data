The variable `digit_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits of `i`. Since `i` is 2, its string representation is '2', and the sum of its digits is 2. Therefore, `digit_sum` is updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2**
