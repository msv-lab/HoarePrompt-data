`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`, which is 3. The previous value of `max_sum` was 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Output State: **`digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
