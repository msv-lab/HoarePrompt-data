Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `n` remains within the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`. The values of `low` and `high` indicate that the binary search has concluded, and the final calculated `mid` will not fall within the bounds for further iterations. Additionally, `can_distribute(mid)` will have returned both true and false during the run, leading to the termination of the loop when `low` is no longer less than `high`.**
