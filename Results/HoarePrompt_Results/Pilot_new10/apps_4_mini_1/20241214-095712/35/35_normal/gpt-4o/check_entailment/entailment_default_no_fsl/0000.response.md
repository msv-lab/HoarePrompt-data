Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the distribution correctly for all potential cases due to its reliance on the `can_distribute` function without proper parameter management. Specifically, the `can_distribute` function does not define `a`, `b`, or `n` within its scope or accept them as parameters. This might lead to incorrect behavior if `a`, `b`, or `n` are not globally defined.

For instance, if `a = 5`, `b = 5`, and `n = 10` but `can_distribute` is called without those variables being defined, it would raise an error or return unintended results. There are edge cases, such as 10 plates and 10 total pieces of cake, leading to all plates having 1 piece, which could be mismanaged without proper encapsulation of the logic.

Thus, the program cannot guarantee correctness across all scenarios without proper parameter handling and may fail in cases where these variables are not explicitly defined.
