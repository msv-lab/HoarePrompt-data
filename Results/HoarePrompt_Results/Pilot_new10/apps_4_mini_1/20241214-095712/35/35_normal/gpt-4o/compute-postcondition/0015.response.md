The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is determined as the average of `low` and `high` (using integer division), and since `low` is less than `high`, `low` will be updated to a value greater than its previous value.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` is equal to `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is unchanged.**
