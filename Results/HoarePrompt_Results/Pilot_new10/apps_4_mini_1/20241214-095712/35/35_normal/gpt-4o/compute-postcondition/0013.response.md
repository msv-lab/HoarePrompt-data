According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop continues as long as `low` is less than `high`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `low` is less than `high`, meaning that the condition for the loop to execute one more time is already satisfied. No adjustments to the state are necessary to allow another iteration of the loop. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` is less than `high`**
