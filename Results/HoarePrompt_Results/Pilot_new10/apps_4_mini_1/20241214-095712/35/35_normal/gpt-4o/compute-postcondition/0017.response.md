Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, if `can_distribute(mid)` is true, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, while `high` and `mid` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `low` remains less than `high`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2$.***
