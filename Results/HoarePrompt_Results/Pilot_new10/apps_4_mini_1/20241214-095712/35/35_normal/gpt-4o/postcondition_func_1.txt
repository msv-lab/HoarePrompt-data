The function accepts a positive integer `x` and checks if the combined number of complete groups that can be formed from `a` pieces of the first cake and `b` pieces of the second cake, calculated as `(a // x) + (b // x)`, is greater than or equal to a specified positive integer `n`. This function returns `True` if the condition is met, and `False` otherwise. It does not directly accept `a`, `b`, or `n` as parameters, which may lead to confusion if they are not defined outside the function.
