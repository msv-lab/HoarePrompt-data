The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is previously calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, so we now have `high` equal to the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The constraints on the variables `n`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, and `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, and `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
