#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (number of plates) such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer (number of pieces of the first cake) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, and b is an integer (number of pieces of the second cake) such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `n` remains within the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`. The values of `low` and `high` indicate that the binary search has concluded, and the final calculated `mid` will not fall within the bounds for further iterations. Additionally, `can_distribute(mid)` will have returned both true and false during the run, leading to the termination of the loop when `low` is no longer less than `high`.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low is equal to high and indicates that the binary search has concluded, confirming that no further iterations will occur within the bounds.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (the number of plates, where 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), and two integers `a` and `b` (the number of pieces of two different cakes, both between 1 and 100). The function performs a binary search to find the maximum number of plates that can be distributed based on the conditions defined in the `can_distribute` function, returning `low - 1`, where `low` is the threshold found when the binary search concludes. The function does not handle edge cases where `n` might be less than 2 or greater than `a + b`, assuming these conditions are met prior to the call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and x is a positive integer such that x >= 1. Additionally, n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean expression indicating whether the sum of integer divisions of 'a' and 'b' by 'x' is greater than or equal to 'n', where 'a' and 'b' are positive integers representing pieces of cake, 'x' is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and 'n' is a positive integer with a value between 2 and 'a + b'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` and checks if the combined number of complete groups that can be formed from `a` pieces of the first cake and `b` pieces of the second cake, calculated as `(a // x) + (b // x)`, is greater than or equal to a specified positive integer `n`. This function returns `True` if the condition is met, and `False` otherwise. It does not directly accept `a`, `b`, or `n` as parameters, which may lead to confusion if they are not defined outside the function.
