`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, where `//` denotes integer division. The previous values of `low` and `high` determine the value of `mid`. Since `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` will be an integer value that is between `low` and `high`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged but are still subject to their constraints. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` must be less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**.
