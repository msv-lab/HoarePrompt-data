The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The values of `n`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged since the operation does not alter them. The state of the program indicates that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2.**
