You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Annotated Functions:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (number of plates) such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer (number of pieces of the first cake) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, and b is an integer (number of pieces of the second cake) such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `n` remains within the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`. The values of `low` and `high` indicate that the binary search has concluded, and the final calculated `mid` will not fall within the bounds for further iterations. Additionally, `can_distribute(mid)` will have returned both true and false during the run, leading to the termination of the loop when `low` is no longer less than `high`.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low is equal to high and indicates that the binary search has concluded, confirming that no further iterations will occur within the bounds.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (the number of plates, where 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), and two integers `a` and `b` (the number of pieces of two different cakes, both between 1 and 100). The function performs a binary search to find the maximum number of plates that can be distributed based on the conditions defined in the `can_distribute` function, returning `low - 1`, where `low` is the threshold found when the binary search concludes. The function does not handle edge cases where `n` might be less than 2 or greater than `a + b`, assuming these conditions are met prior to the call.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and x is a positive integer such that x >= 1. Additionally, n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean expression indicating whether the sum of integer divisions of 'a' and 'b' by 'x' is greater than or equal to 'n', where 'a' and 'b' are positive integers representing pieces of cake, 'x' is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and 'n' is a positive integer with a value between 2 and 'a + b'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` and checks if the combined number of complete groups that can be formed from `a` pieces of the first cake and `b` pieces of the second cake, calculated as `(a // x) + (b // x)`, is greater than or equal to a specified positive integer `n`. This function returns `True` if the condition is met, and `False` otherwise. It does not directly accept `a`, `b`, or `n` as parameters, which may lead to confusion if they are not defined outside the function.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
