The value of `x` is decreased by 1. The initial state provides the conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b`, from which `x` is determined to be the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: 

`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100; `x` is equal to min(n, a, b) - 1.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100; `x` is equal to min(n, a, b) - 1.**
