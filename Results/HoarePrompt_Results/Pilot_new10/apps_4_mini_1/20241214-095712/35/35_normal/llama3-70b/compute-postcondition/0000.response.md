`n`, `a`, and `b` are all reassigned to new integer values based on the input taken from the user. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now explicitly those integers entered by the user. The conditions stating that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100) still hold, but now with the values explicitly assigned based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input; 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ 100**
