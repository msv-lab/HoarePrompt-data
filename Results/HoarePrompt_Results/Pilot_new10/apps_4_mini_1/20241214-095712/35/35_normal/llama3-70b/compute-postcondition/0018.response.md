Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers through user input—`n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the maximum integer `x` such that `x` does not exceed `n`, is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, and still allows equal distribution of leftovers (`a - x` and `b - x`) to be at least `x`. The function then prints this calculated value of `x`. There is an implicit precondition that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. The function does not handle input errors, such as non-integer inputs.**
