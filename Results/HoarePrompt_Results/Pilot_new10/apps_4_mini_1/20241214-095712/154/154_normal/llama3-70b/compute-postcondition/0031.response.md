The expression `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by comparing its current value with the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

- `dp[i][j]` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the result of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 
- The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j` remain unchanged, but the specific entry at `dp[i][j]` could potentially be updated.

Therefore, the output state remains the same for the unchanged variables, with the only change being that `dp[i][j]` could now hold a value that is at least as great as it was, or potentially a new value derived from the maximum calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `j` is 3, and `dp[i][j]` is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.**
