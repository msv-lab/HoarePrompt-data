The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. This means `dp[i][j]` will take the value from the same row `i` but the previous column `j - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since the initial state mentions that `j` is `now 1`, this means that `j - 1` would be `0`, and thus `dp[i][j]` is being assigned the value from the `0`-th column. No other variables or states are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `j` is now 1; `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][0]`.**
