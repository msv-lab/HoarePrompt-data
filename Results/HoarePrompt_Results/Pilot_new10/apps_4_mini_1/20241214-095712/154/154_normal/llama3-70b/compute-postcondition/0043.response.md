Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `j` is 2, `i` is `k + 1`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[k][2 - t[k]] + 1`.***
