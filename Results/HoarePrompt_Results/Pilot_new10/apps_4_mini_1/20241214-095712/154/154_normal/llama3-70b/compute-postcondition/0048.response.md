Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is an integer (1 ≤ M ≤ maximum achievable value), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp[i][j]` for `i = k + 1` represents the maximum value that can be achieved with the given subsets of `t` up to `M`, with `j` iterating from 1 to `M`. If the loop does not execute, `dp[k + 1][j]` remains as it was initialized, unchanged from its initial values.**
