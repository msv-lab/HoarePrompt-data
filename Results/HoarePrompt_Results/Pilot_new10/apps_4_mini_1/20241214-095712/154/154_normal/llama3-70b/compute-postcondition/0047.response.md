Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `j` is 3, `i` is `k + 1`, and `dp[i][3]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][3 - t[i - 1]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.***
