According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs for `i` from 1 to `k`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and the next value for `i` to continue the loop is `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is in the range of 1 to `k`, and for one more iteration to occur, `i` needs to be `k + 1` to exit the loop. Thus, to prepare the state correctly for the next iteration, `i` should be updated to `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value that can be achieved with the conditions provided in the loop across all possible `j` from 1 to `M`, and all potential subsets of `t`, `i` is k + 1**
