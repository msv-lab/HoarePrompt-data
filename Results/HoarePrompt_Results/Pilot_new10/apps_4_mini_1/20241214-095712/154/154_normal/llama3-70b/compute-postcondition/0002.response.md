The `t` list is sorted in ascending order. The variable `t` will now contain its elements in a sorted arrangement, while `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unaffected. The values of `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45, and `M` is a non-negative integer within its specified range. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input.**
