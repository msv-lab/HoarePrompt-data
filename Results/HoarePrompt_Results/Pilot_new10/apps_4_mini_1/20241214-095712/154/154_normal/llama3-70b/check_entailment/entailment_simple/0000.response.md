To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and how it aligns with what the problem requires.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Description**:
   - Three integers: `n` (number of tasks), `k` (number of subtasks per task), and `M` (total available time in minutes).
   - A list of integers `t` representing the time required to complete each of the `k` subtasks.

2. **Tasks and Points Calculation**:
   - For each completed subtask, Polycarp earns 1 point.
   - For each fully completed task (all `k` subtasks), he earns an extra point, making the total points for a completed task equal to `k + 1`.

3. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the total points Polycarp can earn given the constraints of the time available.

### Logic of the Provided Program:
1. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - A 2D list `dp` is created where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved using `j` minutes when considering the first `i` subtasks.

2. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - The nested loops iterate through each subtask and each possible total time, updating the `dp` table based on whether the current subtask can be completed within the remaining time.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points**:
   - Finally, the program computes the total points by summing up the results of the last row in the `dp` table for the maximum time `M` and counting how many complete tasks can be constructed from the solved subtasks.

### Evaluation:
- **Correctness of Logic**: The provided program employs a dynamic programming approach that can effectively calculate both the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the available time and correctly considers the bonus points for fully completed tasks.
- **Completeness**:
   - The iterative approach ensures all subtasks can be considered in various combinations.
   - The final point calculation adds the base points for the solved subtasks and any bonus points for completed tasks.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- When `M = 0`, no subtasks can be completed, and the program correctly returns `0` as expected.
- When `M` is very high compared to the efficient completion of tasks, it still calculates correctly due to dynamic programming's exploration of all options.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem requirements by accurately calculating the maximum points possible based on the subtasks and tasks provided. Its logic and final calculations respect the constraints set forth in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
