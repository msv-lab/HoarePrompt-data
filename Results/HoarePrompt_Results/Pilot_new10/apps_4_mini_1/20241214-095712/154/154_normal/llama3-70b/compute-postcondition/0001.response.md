The value of `t` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which converts a space-separated input string into a list of integers. Other variables `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `t` is now a list of `k` integers as obtained from input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is now a list of `k` integers from input**
