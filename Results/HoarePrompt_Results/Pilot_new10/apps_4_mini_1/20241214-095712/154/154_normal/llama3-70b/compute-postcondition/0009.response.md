Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, and `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) x (M + 1). If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, potentially making `dp[i][j]` greater than 0 based on the previous state. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged at 0.***
