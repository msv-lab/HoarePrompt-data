Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `j` is 1, `i` is k + 1, `dp[k + 1][1] = dp[k + 1][0]`. The current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the value of the last element of `t` at index `i - 1` (which is `t[k]`).***
