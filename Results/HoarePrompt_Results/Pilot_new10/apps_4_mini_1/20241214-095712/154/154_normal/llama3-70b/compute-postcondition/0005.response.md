According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The loop will execute if `M` is at least 1. Given that `i` is already set to 1, it indicates that the loop has not executed yet, and the initial value of `j` will be set to 1 during the first iteration if the loop is to execute.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must hold:
- `M` must be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure that the range from 1 to `M + 1` has at least one valid value.
- `j` will start at 1, which aligns with the start of the range defined in the loop.

Thus, the necessary conditions to be satisfied before the loop execution include `M` being at least 1, and `j` should start at 1 during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `M` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) x (M + 1) initialized with zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
