To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze its logic and see if it adheres to the requirements outlined.

### Problem Description Recap
Polycarp needs to maximize the points he can earn by solving subtasks given:
- Each task has `k` subtasks, taking a known time for each subtask indexed by `j`.
- He gets 1 point for each subtask solved and an extra point for completing all `k` subtasks of a task.
- He has a time limit of `M` minutes.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**
   - The program correctly reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `M`, and a list `t` of k subtasks times.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming table `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum count of subtasks solvable considering the first `i` subtasks and a total of `j` minutes.
   - The first dimension (`i`) represents the subtask index, while the second dimension (`j`) represents the available time.

3. **Induction through Time**
   - The nested loops iterate through potential times and subtasks, ensuring that `dp` is populated correctly on whether the subtask can be completed given the remaining time.

4. **Points Calculation**
   - The calculation to determine the total points is done in two parts:
     - `sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))` counts the maximum number of subtasks solved.
     - `sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)` adds to the count if all `k` subtasks of a task were solved.

### Correctness Verification
- The logic of filling the dp table corresponds to determining the max subtasks that can be completed within the time limit. 
- The program correctly incorporates the bonus point for completing full tasks wherever applicable (indicated by `dp[i][M] == i`).
- The implementation respects the conditions on the input range and constraints given in the problem description.

### Conclusion
The program algorithmically follows the requirements provided in the problem description. It effectively calculates the maximum points Polycarp can earn given the subtasks and the time constraint.

Correctness: **True**
