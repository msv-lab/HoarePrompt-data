The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The indices `i` and `j` both start at 1, meaning that the current state of the dynamic programming table is being accessed. 

Since `dp` is a list of lists initialized with zeros, `dp[i][j - 1]` will refer to the value in the same row as `dp[i][j]`, but one column to the left. Therefore, after this operation, `dp[i][j]` will still be zero because `dp[i][j - 1]` is initialized to zero.

No other variables change as a result of this operation. Thus, the state of the other variables remains intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `M` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) x (M + 1) initialized with zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][j]` is 0.**
