The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. Here, `subtask_time` is the first element of the list `t`, and the initial conditions guarantee that `remaining_time` is not less than `subtask_time`, ensuring that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will be a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n`, `k` is at least 1, `M`, `t` is a list of `k` integers with at least 1 element, `subtask_time` is equal to `t[0]`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.**
