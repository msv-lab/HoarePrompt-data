In the provided code, the `time_used` variable is assigned the value calculated by multiplying `complete_tasks` by `total_time_per_task`. 

Given:
- `complete_tasks` is equal to `n + 1`.
- The value of `total_time_per_task` is not defined in the initial state, so we will reference it as it is.

The state of other variables (`M`, `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved`, `max_points`, `points`) remains unchanged. 

Now we evaluate:
- Since `complete_tasks = n + 1`, we can express the updated `time_used` as `time_used = (n + 1) * total_time_per_task`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `remaining_time` is unchanged, `subtasks_solved` is unchanged, `max_points` is unchanged, `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`, `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`, `points` is unchanged.**
