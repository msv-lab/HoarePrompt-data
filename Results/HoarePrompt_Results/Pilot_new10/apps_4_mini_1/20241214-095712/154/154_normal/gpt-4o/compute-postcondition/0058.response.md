Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `remaining_time` is unchanged, `subtasks_solved` is unchanged, `max_points` is unchanged, `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`, `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`, `points` is unchanged. If `time_used` exceeds `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
