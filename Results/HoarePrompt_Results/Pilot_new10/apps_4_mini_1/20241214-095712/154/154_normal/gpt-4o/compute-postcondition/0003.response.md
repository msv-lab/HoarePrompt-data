The variable `time_used` is assigned the value calculated from `complete_tasks` multiplied by `total_time_per_task`. Initially, `complete_tasks` is 0, and `total_time_per_task` is the sum of elements in the list `t`.

Since `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` will be:

```
time_used = 0 * total_time_per_task = 0
```

Other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`) remain unchanged. The output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0.**
