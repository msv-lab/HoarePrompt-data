The variable `remaining_time` is updated by subtracting the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, which means it's the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved given the remaining time and the time for each subtask. After updating `remaining_time`, all the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `subtask_time` is the third element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`.
