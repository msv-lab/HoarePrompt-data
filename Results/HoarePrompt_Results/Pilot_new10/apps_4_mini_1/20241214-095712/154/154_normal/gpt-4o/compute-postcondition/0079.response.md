The value of `subtasks_solved` is assigned the minimum between its previous value and the product of `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. The prior value of `subtasks_solved` is not specified, so its exact value cannot be determined. However, the expression `(n - complete_tasks) * k` calculates a new potential maximum number of subtasks that can be solved based on `n`, `complete_tasks`, and `k`. 

Given the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 45` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 45`, the amount of subtasks that can now be solved will be a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `remaining_time` is adjusted; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`; `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, and `points` remain unchanged.**
