To analyze the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we can evaluate how well the code matches each requirement and check for potential edge cases.

The problem involves calculating the maximum points Polycarp can score given a certain time `M`, the number of tasks `n`, the number of subtasks per task `k`, and the time `t_j` required for each subtask. If he finishes a task, he receives extra points for completing all subtasks in that task.

### Code Review:

1. **Complete Tasks Calculation:**
   The loop iterates through the number of complete tasks he can attempt to finish, calculating the total time used for completed tasks and checking against the time `M`.

2. **Remaining Time Calculation:**
   After completing a certain number of tasks, the remaining time is calculated correctly.

3. **Subtask Solving Loop:**
   The program then tries to solve as many subtasks as possible within the remaining time. It accounts for how many tasks can be attempted with the remaining time for each subtask time.

4. **Points Calculation:**
   Points are calculated based on fully completed tasks (which give `k + 1` points) and any additional subtasks completed in the remaining time.

### Potential Issues:
- The code does not handle an edge case where `M` is 0, which should straightforwardly return 0 since no subtasks can be completed in zero time.
- The points earned are calculated based on both completed tasks and subtasks, but in cases where the total time available is exactly equal to the time needed for specific subtasks, there could be miscalculations if time limits aren't considered carefully in the loops.
  
- It assumes valid input as per the problem description, but if the task list `t` were empty or contained invalid values (less than 1), the behavior remains unspecified.

### Conclusion:
Although the function is designed to cover various scenarios effectively, it fails the edge case where the total time `M` is 0 and does not check for the validity of input subtasks. Therefore, we cannot confidently say it handles every possible input scenario according to the problem description.

Thus, the correctness of the code in terms of the problem statement is:

Correctness: **False**.
