Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `subtask_time` is the second element in `t`, `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the result of integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
