Correctness: **False**

The program fails in cases where the available time `M` is less than the time required to solve any single subtask from `t`. In such situations, Polycarp cannot earn any points because he cannot complete any subtasks. The code currently allows for the possibility of solving an undefined number of subtasks even when the time available does not permit completion of even a single subtask, which leads to incorrect point calculation.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1 1 0
1
```

In this case, Polycarp has no time to solve any subtasks (`M = 0`), yet the logic potentially allows for a calculation that incorrectly calculates points based on the assumption that subtasks can still be solved, which they cannot. Thus, the output will be incorrectly calculated as 0 points, while the logic might not explicitly handle this case correctly. 

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential edge cases, confirming its incorrectness.
