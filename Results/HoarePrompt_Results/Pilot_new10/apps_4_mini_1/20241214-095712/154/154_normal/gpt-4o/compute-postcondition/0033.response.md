The variable `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The previous value of `complete_tasks` has been established as `n + 1`. Therefore, substituting this into the calculation gives:

`points = (n + 1) * (k + 1)`

The other variables are unchanged based on the initial state provided. The output state now reflects the new calculation for `points`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is unchanged; `subtasks_solved` is now min(`subtasks_solved`, (n - complete_tasks) * k); `max_points` is updated to max(`max_points`, `points` + `subtasks_solved`); `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`; `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; `points` is `(n + 1) * (k + 1)`.**
