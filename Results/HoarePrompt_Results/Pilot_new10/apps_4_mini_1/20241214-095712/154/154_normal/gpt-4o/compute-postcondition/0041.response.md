Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, and `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the integer division of the previous `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `remaining_time` or `subtasks_solved.`***
