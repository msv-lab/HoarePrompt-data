Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are at least 2, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers with at least 2 elements, `subtask_time` is the second integer in the list, and `remaining_time` is unchanged. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.***
