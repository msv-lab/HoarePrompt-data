Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, and `M` is unchanged; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time % subtask_time`, while `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, and `points` remain unchanged; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, no changes occur in the variables of interest.***
