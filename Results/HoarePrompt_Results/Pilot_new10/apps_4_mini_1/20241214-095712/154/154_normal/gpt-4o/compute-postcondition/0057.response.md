The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `remaining_time` is unchanged, `subtasks_solved` is unchanged, `max_points` is unchanged, `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`, `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`, `points` is unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
