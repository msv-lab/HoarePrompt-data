`points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks` multiplied by `(k + 1)`. The previous value of `complete_tasks` is 0, therefore `points` will be equal to `0 * (k + 1)`, which yields `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `M` are integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` being a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, and `points` is 0.
