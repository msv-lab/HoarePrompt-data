The variable `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The value of `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`, and `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45. Thus, `points` is calculated as `(n + 1) * (k + 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is unchanged; `subtasks_solved` is unchanged; `max_points` is unchanged; `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`; `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `points` is `(n + 1) * (k + 1)`**
