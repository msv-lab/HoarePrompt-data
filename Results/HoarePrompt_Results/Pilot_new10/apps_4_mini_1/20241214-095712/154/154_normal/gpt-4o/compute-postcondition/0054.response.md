Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `remaining_time` is updated based on the total subtasks that could be solved given the elements of `t`, `subtasks_solved` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and (n - complete_tasks) * k, `max_points` is updated to max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved), `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, and `points` retain their values calculated before the loop based on `n` and `k`.**
