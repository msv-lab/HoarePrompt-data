The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
