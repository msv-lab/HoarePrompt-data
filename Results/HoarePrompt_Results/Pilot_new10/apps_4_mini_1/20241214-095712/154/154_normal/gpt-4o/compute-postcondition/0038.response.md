The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated by dividing `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. Since `remaining_time` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will be at least 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State will reflect this new computed value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers that must have at least 1 element, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
