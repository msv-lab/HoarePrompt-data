The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. Here are the details of each parameter:

- `n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 45 \).
- `k` is an integer where \( 1 \leq k \leq 45 \).
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^9 \).
- `t` is a list of integers of size `k`, where each \( t[j] \) (for \( 1 \leq j \leq k \)) represents the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask, and each element \( t[j] \) satisfies \( 1 \leq t[j] \leq 1000000 \).

After executing the function body, the program returns `max_points`, which is updated to reflect the maximum points achievable based on the number of completed tasks (`n`) and the subtasks solved (`k`). The points are calculated as \( n \times (k + 1) \), while considering the time used for completion.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list of integers `t`, and return the maximum points achievable based on the completed tasks and subtasks solved. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and t, and returns the maximum points achievable based on completed tasks and the subtasks solved.**
