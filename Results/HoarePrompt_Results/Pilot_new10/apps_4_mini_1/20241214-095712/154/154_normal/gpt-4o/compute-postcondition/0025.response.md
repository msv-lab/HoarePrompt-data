Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are at least 2, `M` remains unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers with at least 3 elements, `subtask_time` is the third integer in the list, and `remaining_time` is unchanged unless `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, in which case `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
