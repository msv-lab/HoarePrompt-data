The code updates the variable `max_points` by taking the maximum between its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `remaining_time`, `complete_tasks`, `points`, and `subtasks_solved` are still valid after execution, except for `subtasks_solved`, which has been updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is unchanged; `complete_tasks` is unchanged; `subtasks_solved` is now min(`subtasks_solved`, (n - complete_tasks) * k); `max_points` is updated to max(`max_points`, `points` + `subtasks_solved`).**
