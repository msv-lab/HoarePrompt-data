Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum points Polycarp can earn. It appears to focus only on the subtasks completed and adds points incorrectly.

### Issues identified:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: The DP array `dp[i][j]` is intended to store the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed in `j` minutes using `i` different subtasks. However, it does not account correctly for the tasks themselves and the additional point gained from fully completing each task.

2. **Counting Completed Tasks**: The program attempts to calculate the total points by simply adding the number of subtasks completed and an additional point for each fully completed task. However, it does not keep track of how many full tasks have been completed based on the time used.

3. **Implementation Mistake**: The way it sums up the points does not adhere to the requirement of maximizing the points overall. For each task's set of subtasks, if time permits, Polycarp should aim to complete tasks fully first before attempting to get additional subtasks in other tasks.

### Test Case Example where the code fails:
Let's consider the input:
``` 
2 3 10
2 2 2
```
According to the logic:
- Polycarp can complete one complete task (which costs 6 minutes) and have 4 minutes left, which allows him to complete one more subtask from the next task.
- He should earn: `3 (for completed task 1) + 1 (extra point for completing task 1) + 1 (for one completed subtask of task 2) = 5 points`.

According to the faulty program logic, the output will not correctly compute the maximum points due to mishandling of task completions and additional point calculation. Thus it fails to satisfy the problem requirements in specific instances like these. 

Because the program does not return the correct points earned under scenarios like this, it does not fully satisfy the problem conditions and is therefore considered incorrect.
