Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a flaw in how it handles the calculation of subtasks that can be solved after completing some tasks. Specifically, the line `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)` incorrectly limits the number of additional subtasks that can be earned based on the number of tasks left to complete instead of just tallying the total time that can still be spent.

Consider a case where:
- n = 2 (number of tasks)
- k = 3 (subtasks per task)
- M = 5 (total available minutes)
- t = [1, 1, 1] (time required for each subtask)

Expected behavior:
- Polycarp could complete both tasks, using exactly 6 minutes (1+1+1 for each task) which is impossible, or complete 1 task (3 minutes) and have 2 minutes left to solve 2 additional subtasks (1 from each of the other tasks), yielding 5 total points (3 for the completed task, 2 for the subtasks).

However, due to the logic error, it could incorrectly calculate the number of subtasks resolved based on the tasks remaining rather than the remaining time. The program may either undercount or provide results that do not align with the correct number of points based on the subtasks earned. 

Hence, the program fails to guarantee correct results in all cases and is therefore incorrect.
