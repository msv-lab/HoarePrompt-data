To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic in the program and consider edge cases or scenarios that might not be handled correctly.

The key points in the problem description are:
1. We need to transform a zero matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) by performing operations on \( B \).
2. Each operation involved replacing elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix of \( B \) with '1'.
3. We must check if it is possible to form \( A \) using a sequence of these operations and output either the number of operations and their details or -1 if it's impossible.

Key observations in the provided program:
- The function `func_1(n, m, A)` attempts to locate where we can perform the \( 2 \times 2 \) operations by checking the corresponding elements in \( A \).
- It only considers the situation where a \( 2 \times 2 \) block in \( A \) is completely filled with '1's before marking it in \( B \).
- The final step checks if \( B \) matches \( A \) and returns -1 if there is any discrepancy.

While this logic seems sound for specific cases, we have to consider edge cases where the formation of \( A \) might not be achievable solely through \( 2 \times 2 \) operations.

### Possible Counter Example:
Consider the following matrix \( A \):

```
3 3
1 0 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

In this case:
- \( A[0][0] = 1\) allows us to perform the operation at cell \( (1, 1) \), which would change the matrix \( B \) to:
```
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```
- However, the operation at cell \( (1, 1) \) would set \( B[0][1] \) and \( B[1][0] \) to '1', which correctly reflects the construction being incomplete, as \( A[0][1] \) remains '0'.
- Ultimately, we arrive at a situation where part of matrix \( A \) can not be formed due to an unachievable single '1' that has a '0' adjacent in both rows and columns.

### Conclusion:
Thus, since the given program fails to account for specific configurations like the counterexample above, and these scenarios will lead the code to incorrect behavior by returning operations when it is not actually possible to achieve the intended matrix \( A \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
