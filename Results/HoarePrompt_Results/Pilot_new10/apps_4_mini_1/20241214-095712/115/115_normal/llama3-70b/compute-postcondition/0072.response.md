Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is an integer from 2 to 50, `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every `(i, j)` pair where at least one of the elements in positions `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1; if the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the printed values will correspond to all the elements in `ops`, indicating each operation performed by the loop, with `len(ops)` potentially being 0 if no valid pairs were found or a positive integer indicating the number of valid operations.***
