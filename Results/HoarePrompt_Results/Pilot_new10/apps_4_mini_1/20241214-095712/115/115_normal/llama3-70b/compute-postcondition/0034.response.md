Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, and `i`, `j` are equal to 1. If at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` contains the tuple (2, 2); if all four values are equal to 1, then `ops` contains the tuple (2, 1). If none of the cells contain 1, the program does not execute any further action.***
