The code `continue` is a control flow statement that does not change the values of any variables. It simply instructs the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples (2, j + 1) for each executed iteration where at least one of `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, or `A[1][1]` is equal to 1; the current values of `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all equal to 1.`**
