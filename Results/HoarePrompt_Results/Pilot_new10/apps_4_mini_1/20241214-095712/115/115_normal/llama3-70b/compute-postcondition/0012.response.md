The `continue` statement does not modify any variables directly; it simply causes the loop to skip the remaining code within the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since `i` and `j` are initialized but not modified by this line, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
