The `ops` list is updated to include a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is also 0, the new tuple will be `(0 + 1, 0 + 1)` which results in `(1, 1)`. The value of `A` remains unchanged because we only updated the `ops` list.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `ops` has been updated to include (1, 1)**.
