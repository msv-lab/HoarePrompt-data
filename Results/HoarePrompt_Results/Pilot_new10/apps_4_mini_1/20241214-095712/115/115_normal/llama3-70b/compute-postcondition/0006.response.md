The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is within and immediately proceed to the next iteration. However, it does not change the state of any variables or affect the loop's conditions. Therefore, none of the variables are modified.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the values in `A` remain: `A[0][0]` is 1, `A[1][0]` is 1, `A[0][1]` is 1, and `A[1][1]` is 1.**
