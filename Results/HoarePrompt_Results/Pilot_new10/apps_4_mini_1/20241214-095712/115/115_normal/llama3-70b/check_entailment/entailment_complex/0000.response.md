The provided program intends to check if it is possible to convert a zero matrix \( B \) into a given matrix \( A \) through a sequence of operations that set \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices of \( B \) to 1. However, the correctness of the program was not implemented correctly according to the prescribed problem description.

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Checking Logic**: The nested loops iterate through all \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices of \( A \). If any of the four positions contains a 1, the program considers it suitable to add the operation — it does not check to ensure that a \( 2 \times 2 \) area can actually be entirely filled with 1s after performing the operations. The problem specifically states that the goal is to make \( B \) equal to \( A \), which cannot be ensured by merely checking for at least one 1. The check should ensure that **all four** positions of a chosen \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix in \( A \) are 1 to add the operation.

2. **Final Output Logic**: The code currently does not return -1 if it is impossible to transform \( B \) into \( A \). The OPs list will collect operations indiscriminately based on the wrong check, possibly allowing configurations to exist in `ops` that would never allow \( B \) to match \( A \).

3. **Missing Verification of Compatibility**: After generating operations, there’s no verification to see if \( B \) matches \( A \) after applying these operations. The program fails to see if the generated operations will yield the desired transformation.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure that \( B \) is equal to \( A \). It does not correctly determine the operations needed and risks generating invalid submatrices that cannot be achieved through the allowed operations. Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
