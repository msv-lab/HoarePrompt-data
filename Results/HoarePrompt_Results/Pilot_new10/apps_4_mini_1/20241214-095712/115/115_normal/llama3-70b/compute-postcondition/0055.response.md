In the provided code, the statement `continue` does not change any variable values; rather, it controls the flow of execution in a loop by skipping the rest of the current iteration and continuing to the next one. However, without any additional context regarding a loop structure or the presence of a surrounding construct for the `continue` statement, we cannot conclude that any specific variable has changed or been impacted.

Therefore, the output state can still reflect that `i` is 2, and `j` is 2, and that we have invoked a `continue` statement.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
