The code snippet prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. Given that `len(ops)` is greater than 1, it indicates that the list `ops` contains at least two operations. Hence, `op` can be assigned as `ops[0]` for accessing the first element of the list.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the printed values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` while maintaining the conditions given in the initial state.

Output State: **`A` must have at least one valid `(i, j)` pair where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `len(ops)` is greater than 1; the values printed are `op[0]` and `op[1]` from the next op in the list.**
