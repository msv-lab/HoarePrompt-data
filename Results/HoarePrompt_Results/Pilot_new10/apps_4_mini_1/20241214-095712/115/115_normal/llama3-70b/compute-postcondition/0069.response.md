According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. If the list has more than 1 operation, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(ops)` is greater than 1, indicating there is at least 2 operations in the list. The values printed in the last iteration are `op[0]` and `op[1]`, which corresponds to the current operation in the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `op` will be assigned the next operation in the `ops` list. Therefore, the length of `ops` must now be at least 2 (to allow for the next operation to exist, as one operation will be consumed) and `op` will represent the next operation.

Thus, if `len(ops)` is greater than 1 at the end of the last iteration, to execute one more time, it must be at least 2 before the next iteration. This means we need to reduce the length by one operation for the next iteration, making the required condition for `len(ops)` at least 2 becomes `len(ops)` must be at least 2; `op` would be the next one in the list.

State: **`A` must have at least one valid `(i, j)` pair where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `len(ops)` must be at least 2; the values printed are `op[0]` and `op[1]` from the next op in the list.**
