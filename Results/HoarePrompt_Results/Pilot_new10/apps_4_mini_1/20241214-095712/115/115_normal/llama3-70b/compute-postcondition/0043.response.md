Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` contains the tuples (2, j + 1) for each executed iteration where at least one of `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, or `A[1][1]` is equal to 1. The current values of `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all equal to 1.***
