Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If any of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are equal to 1, then the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` which is `(1, 2)` is included in `ops`. There is no else part, so if the condition is not met, the program continues without altering `ops`.***
