To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the loop control variable `j` and the upper bound of the loop `m`.

Given that:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.
- The loop iterates with `for j in range(m - 1)`, meaning it runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`.

At `j = 1`, the loop has executed once (for `j = 0`) and will execute again for `j = 1` as `j` is still less than `m - 1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to `2` in the next iteration.

For the next execution, we need to ensure that `j` stays within the bounds set by `m`. Since `m` is at least 2, `m - 1` must be at least 1, allowing the iteration to go to `j = 2` before it stops.

Thus, after the next iteration, the states will be:
- `j` will be incremented to `2`.

We will keep all other states unchanged since no other variables are modified in this loop structure.

Putting this together, the adjusted state will be:

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.**
