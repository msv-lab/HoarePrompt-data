Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If any of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` is updated to include (1, 1). Otherwise, the state of `A` remains unchanged with respect to this condition.***
