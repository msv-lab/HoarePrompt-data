Given the initial conditions of `A`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and the specified logic involving checks on the elements of the list, let's analyze the impact of the provided code.

1. The variable `i` is set to 1, and `j` is set to 2.
2. The values `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` correspond to `A[1][2]`, `A[2][2]`, `A[1][3]`, and `A[2][3]`.
3. Depending on the combination of these values (0s and 1s), we determine whether `ops` is updated and what tuple is appended.

The code snippet appends `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops`. Therefore, after the execution:
- If at least one of the values among the four mentioned is 1, `ops` will be updated.
- If all four are equal to 1, `ops` would specifically contain the tuple `(2, 1)` additional to what was mentioned before.
- If none of these contain a 1, no action is taken, and `ops` remains unchanged.

In terms of the final output state, let's update according to the conditions mentioned. Since we do not have specific values for the list `A` and it's not clear whether `ops` existed before this execution, let's assume `ops` is initially empty:

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2; `ops` contains (2, 3) if at least one of `A[1][2]`, `A[2][2]`, `A[1][3]`, `A[2][3]` is 1, else ops remains unchanged.**
