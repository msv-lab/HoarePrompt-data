To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided information carefully.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(m - 1):`, which will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`. This means that `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at least once, which is satisfied since `m` is stated to be at least 2.

2. The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and will take values up to `m - 2`. As `j` starts at 0 and incrementally increases, we need to ensure that the conditions regarding the tuples in `ops` are met for the first iteration. 

3. Given that `ops` contains tuples `(1, j + 1)` for every `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, it suggests that the loop may require specific context about the state of `A` to validly execute.

4. The assumption is that at least one of the elements in `A` for the indices specified must hold a value of 1 for the loop to execute without any additional logic in the body of the loop. Since `j` starts at 0, which means initially we need to verify:
   - `A[0][0]`
   - `A[1][0]`
   - `A[0][1]`
   - `A[1][1]` 
   must have at least one value that is equal to 1. This condition can be enforced in the program state.

5. No other adjustments to `n`, `i`, or `ops` seem necessary based on the initial conditions provided, aside from confirming the aforementioned condition about `A`.

Thus, we can formulate the necessary state details for the loop to execute.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and at least one of `A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], or A[1][1]` must be equal to 1**
