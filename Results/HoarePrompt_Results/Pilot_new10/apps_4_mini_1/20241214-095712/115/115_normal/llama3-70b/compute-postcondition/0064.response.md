Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is an integer from 2 to 50, `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every `(i, j)` pair where at least one of the elements in the positions `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, for `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2` and `j` in the range `0` to `m - 2`; `len(ops)` has been printed (a count of the tuples in `ops`).**
