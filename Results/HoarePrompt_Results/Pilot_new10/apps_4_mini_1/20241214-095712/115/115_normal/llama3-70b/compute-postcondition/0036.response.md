The code `continue` is a control statement that transfers control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. No variables change value as a result of executing this statement, but it implies that the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

Since it's mentioned that `ops` contains tuples based on certain conditions but not executed any further action, it indicates that we fall into the scenario where none of the cells contain a 1. Therefore, `ops` remains unchanged and no further action is taken.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and no further action executed since none of the cells contain 1.**
