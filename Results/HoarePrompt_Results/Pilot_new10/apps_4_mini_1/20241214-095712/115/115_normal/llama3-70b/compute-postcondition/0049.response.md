According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range of `m`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and since `m` is at least 2, `m - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 and become 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1, which it is not at the incremented value of 1.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `ops` contains tuples (2, j + 1) for each executed iteration where at least one of `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, or `A[1][1]` is equal to 1. If at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` now contains an additional tuple (3, 1).`**
