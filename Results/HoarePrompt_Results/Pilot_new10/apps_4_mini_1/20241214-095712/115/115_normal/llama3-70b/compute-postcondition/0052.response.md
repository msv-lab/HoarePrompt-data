The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 1, respectively, so the tuple that gets added is `(3, 2)`.

Since `ops` is modified by appending the new tuple, and the rest of the state remains unchanged, the output state reflects this change in `ops`. The conditions regarding `A` and the additional tuple based on the values of `A` do not affect the outcome since they are not stated as conditions necessary to evaluate before this operation.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `ops` has an additional tuple (3, 2) appended.**
