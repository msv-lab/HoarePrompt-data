According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2`, meaning that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least `2`. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i` will take on the values starting from `0` up to `n - 2`. Before the loop starts, `i` is not initialized, so we can say that it will be `0` when the loop begins. Since `m` is also provided as within the bounds of `2` to `50`, it doesn't affect the iteration of the loop itself. 

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `n` must be at least `2`
- `i` starts at `0`

Because `m` does not affect the loop execution and can remain as is, the relevant adjustments are:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0**
