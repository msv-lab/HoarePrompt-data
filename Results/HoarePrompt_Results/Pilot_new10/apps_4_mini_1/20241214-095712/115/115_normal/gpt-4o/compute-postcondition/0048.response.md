To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved and their states. 

1. The loop iterates `n` times, so `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.
2. The state of `B` and `operations` before the loop starts is crucial. If `B` contains only 0s and `operations` is empty, that implies no transformations have been made successfully, possibly indicating that `A` either had no `2x2` submatrices of all `1`s or that `n` is indeed causing no iterations to occur.

Thus, we need to ensure:
- `n` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.
- To report on the state of `B`, we might also note that `B` must be relevant in the sense that it should have valid entries (though the exact values depend on the input matrix `A`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute effectively, we adjust the state as follows.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may contain tuples of transformations if they occurred; if not, `B` can remain as a list of 0s and `operations` as empty**.
