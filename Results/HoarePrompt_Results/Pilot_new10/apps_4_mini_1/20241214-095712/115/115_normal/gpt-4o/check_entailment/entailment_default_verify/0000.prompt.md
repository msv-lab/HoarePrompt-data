You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----

3 3
1 1 1

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic in the program and consider edge cases or scenarios that might not be handled correctly.

The key points in the problem description are:
1. We need to transform a zero matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) by performing operations on \( B \).
2. Each operation involved replacing elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix of \( B \) with '1'.
3. We must check if it is possible to form \( A \) using a sequence of these operations and output either the number of operations and their details or -1 if it's impossible.

Key observations in the provided program:
- The function `func_1(n, m, A)` attempts to locate where we can perform the \( 2 \times 2 \) operations by checking the corresponding elements in \( A \).
- It only considers the situation where a \( 2 \times 2 \) block in \( A \) is completely filled with '1's before marking it in \( B \).
- The final step checks if \( B \) matches \( A \) and returns -1 if there is any discrepancy.

While this logic seems sound for specific cases, we have to consider edge cases where the formation of \( A \) might not be achievable solely through \( 2 \times 2 \) operations.

### Possible Counter Example:
Consider the following matrix \( A \):

```
3 3
1 0 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

In this case:
- \( A[0][0] = 1\) allows us to perform the operation at cell \( (1, 1) \), which would change the matrix \( B \) to:
```
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```
- However, the operation at cell \( (1, 1) \) would set \( B[0][1] \) and \( B[1][0] \) to '1', which correctly reflects the construction being incomplete, as \( A[0][1] \) remains '0'.
- Ultimately, we arrive at a situation where part of matrix \( A \) can not be formed due to an unachievable single '1' that has a '0' adjacent in both rows and columns.

### Conclusion:
Thus, since the given program fails to account for specific configurations like the counterexample above, and these scenarios will lead the code to incorrect behavior by returning operations when it is not actually possible to achieve the intended matrix \( A \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `A` containing `n` sublists each with `m` binary integers (0 or 1). It attempts to create a new list `B` where positions corresponding to 2x2 blocks of `1`s in `A` are set to `1`. The function returns -1 if there are discrepancies between `A` and `B` after the transformation, indicating that not all elements in `A` match those in `B` based on the transformation criteria. If transformations are successful, it prints the number of transformations and their 1-indexed positions without returning any other output. The function does not explicitly handle cases where no transformations occur, nor does it address any potential errors with empty or malformed input lists. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
