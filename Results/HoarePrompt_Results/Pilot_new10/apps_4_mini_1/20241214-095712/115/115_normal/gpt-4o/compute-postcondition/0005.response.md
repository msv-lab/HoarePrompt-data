In the provided code, the values for the elements of the array `B` at positions defined by `i`, `j`, and their increments are each assigned the value 1. 

From the initial state:
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0
- The values of `A` at specified positions (`A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]`) are all 1.

The code modifies the values of `B` as follows:
- `B[0][0]` is assigned 1
- `B[0][1]` is assigned 1
- `B[1][0]` is assigned 1
- `B[1][1]` is assigned 1

No other variables are affected, and the state of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `B[0][0] = 1, B[0][1] = 1, B[1][0] = 1, B[1][1] = 1**
