According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` as it iterates from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is currently 0. For the loop to execute one more time, it must increment `j` by 1, making `j` equal to 1, and the range for `j` must allow for this value. Since the loop is running on `range(m)`, `m` must be at least 2 for the next iteration to happen.

State: **`B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` must be greater than 1, `A[k + 1][j]` equals `B[k + 1][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `i` is `k + 1` (which is less than `n`), `j` is 1, and `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]`.**
