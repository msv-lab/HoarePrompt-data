Initial State: `B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` is greater than 0, `A[k + 2][j]` equals `B[k + 2][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `i` is `k + 2`, `j` is equal to `m`, and all elements of `A[i][j]` have been verified to equal the corresponding elements in `B[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`. No return value has occurred during the loop execution.

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `j` starts at 0, and the elements `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal for `j = 0` and `j = 1`, and if `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program would return -1. The loop continues executing because all conditions are met for both iterations.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal for `j = 0`, `j = 1`, and `j = 2`. Since `j` is now equal to `m`, which is the upper bound of the loop, the program has completed all iterations without returning -1. 

Output State after the loop completes all iterations: `B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` is the number of columns, which are all verified, `i` is `k + 2`, `j` has reached `m` where all `A[i][j]` are equal to the corresponding `B[i][j]` for all indexes `j` from 0 to `m - 1`. 

Output State: **`B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 2`, all elements `A[i][j]` are equal to `B[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m - 1`.**
