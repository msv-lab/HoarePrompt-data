The code snippet modifies elements in a 2D array presumably named `B`, using the indices defined by the variables `i`, `j`, and also based on `i + 1` and `j + 1`. The initial values of these variables are `i = 0` and `j = 1`.

1. The value of `B[0][1]` will be set to `1`.
2. The value of `B[0][2]` (which corresponds to `j + 1`) will be set to `1`.
3. The value of `B[1][1]` (which corresponds to `i + 1` and `j`) will be set to `1`.
4. The value of `B[1][2]` (which corresponds to `i + 1` and `j + 1`) will be set to `1`.

The variables `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` themselves are not changed by this code. They still retain their initial values and conditions: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. Since the 2D array `B` is not defined in terms of its size besides the implicit requirement from `n` and `m`, we assume its dimensions are compatible with the accesses made.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the specific values of the array `B` at the mentioned indices have been set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `B[0][1] = 1`, `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`**
