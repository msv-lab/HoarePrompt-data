The statement `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple of `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Given that `i` is initially 0 and `j` is 2, the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` are calculated as follows:

- `i + 1` is `0 + 1 = 1`
- `j + 1` is `2 + 1 = 3`

Therefore, the tuple `(1, 3)` is appended to the `operations` list. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[0][3] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`, `B[1][3] = 1`, and `operations` now contains the tuple (1, 3).**
