According to the code, the loop will execute again if the index `i` is still in the valid range specified by `n`. Since `n` is at least 2 at the end of the last iteration and `i` is currently 1, the loop can execute one more time for the next value of `i` which will be 2. Additionally, for this to be valid, `n - 1` must be at least 2 (which means `n` must be at least 3) because `i` will take values from 0 to `n - 2` during the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (to allow `i` to take the value 2), and `m` can remain the same since it does not affect the loop's execution directly. 

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
