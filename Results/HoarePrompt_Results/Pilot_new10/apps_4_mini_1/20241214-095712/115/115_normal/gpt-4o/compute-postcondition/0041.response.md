Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1, and `operations` now includes the tuple (3, 2). If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `B` or `operations`.***
