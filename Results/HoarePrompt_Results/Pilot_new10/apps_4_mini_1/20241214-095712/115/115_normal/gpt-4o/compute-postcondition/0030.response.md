Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1, and `operations` now includes the tuple `(2, 3)` as `(i + 1, j + 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made to `B` or `operations`.***
