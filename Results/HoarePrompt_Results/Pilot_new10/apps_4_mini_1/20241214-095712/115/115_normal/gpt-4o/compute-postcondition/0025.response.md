The statement `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are both 1, so this will compute as `(1 + 1, 1 + 1)`, resulting in `(2, 2)`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `B[1][1]` = 1, `B[1][2]` = 1, `B[2][1]` = 1, `B[2][2]` = 1, and the tuple (2, 2) has been appended to `operations`.**
