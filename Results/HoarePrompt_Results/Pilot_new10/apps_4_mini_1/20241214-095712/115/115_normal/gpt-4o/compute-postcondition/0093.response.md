The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. Both `n` and `m` are integers with the constraints that they are in the range 2 to 50, inclusive. The parameter `A` is a list consisting of `n` lists, each of which contains `m` integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1. 

Based on the output cases, the function seems to be designed to evaluate certain conditions related to the transformation of elements in the list `A`, although all cases ultimately indicate a failure, returning -1 in each scenario.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is as follows: it accepts two integers `n` and `m` along with a list `A` of lists containing integers, and it returns -1 in various failure scenarios related to the transformation of elements in `A`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m as integers and A as a list of n lists containing m integers (0 or 1), and it returns -1 in multiple failure cases associated with the transformation of elements in A.**
