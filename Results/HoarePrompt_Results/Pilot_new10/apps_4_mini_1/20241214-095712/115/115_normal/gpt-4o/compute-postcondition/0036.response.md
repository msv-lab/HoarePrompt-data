The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple to the list `operations`, where the first element is `i + 1` and the second element is `j + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 3
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 0
- `B[2][0] = 1`, `B[2][1] = 1`, `B[3][0] = 1`, `B[3][1] = 1`

Now we calculate:
- `i + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

The tuple `(3, 1)` will be appended to the `operations` list. The previous values of `operations` and other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `B[2][0] = 1`, `B[2][1] = 1`, `B[3][0] = 1`, `B[3][1] = 1`, and `operations` has been updated to include (3, 1)**.
