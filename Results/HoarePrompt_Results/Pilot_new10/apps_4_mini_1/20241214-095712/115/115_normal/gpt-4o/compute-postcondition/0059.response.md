Output State: **`B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` is the number of columns in `A[i]` (which must be greater than 0), and the value of `A[i][j]` is equal to the value of `B[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`. If any `A[i][j]` was not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function would have returned -1 and not completed the loop.**
