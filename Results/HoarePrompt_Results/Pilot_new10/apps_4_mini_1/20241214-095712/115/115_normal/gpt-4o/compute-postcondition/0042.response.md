According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2. Since `m` is at least 3 (which means `m - 1` is at least 2), the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
