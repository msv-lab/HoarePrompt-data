The code creates a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` and appends it to the list `operations`. The current values of `i` and `j` are both `0`, so the expression evaluates to `(0 + 1, 0 + 1)`, which results in the tuple `(1, 1)`. The other variable states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `operations` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)`, and `B[0][0] = 1, B[0][1] = 1, B[1][0] = 1, B[1][1] = 1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `operations` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)`, `B[0][0] = 1, B[0][1] = 1, B[1][0] = 1, B[1][1] = 1**
