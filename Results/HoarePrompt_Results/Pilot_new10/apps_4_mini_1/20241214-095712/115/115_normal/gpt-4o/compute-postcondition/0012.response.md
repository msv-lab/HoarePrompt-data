According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2. Additionally, for the loop to run, `m` must be greater than 2 so that `m - 1` remains valid.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
