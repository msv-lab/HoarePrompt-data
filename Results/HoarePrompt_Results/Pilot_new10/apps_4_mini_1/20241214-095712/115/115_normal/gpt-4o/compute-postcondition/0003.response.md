According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop iterates from `0` to `m - 2`, meaning that for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least `2`. Given that `n` is at least `2`, this condition may hold true for `m`. Since the state starts with `i` as `0`, it indicates that the loop has not yet executed, and `j` will initialize to `0` in the first iteration.

For the loop to be executed, `m` must be greater than or equal to `2`, and `j` will begin as `0`. This means `j` will properly indicate the current loop iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
