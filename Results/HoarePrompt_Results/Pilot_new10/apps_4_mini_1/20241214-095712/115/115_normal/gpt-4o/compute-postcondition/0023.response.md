According to the code, whether the loop can execute again is determined by the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` by 1, leading to `j` being 1. To check whether the loop can run again, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `m - 1`. Since `j` will be 1, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 (`j` must be less than `m - 1`, which means `1 < m - 1` resulting in `m > 2`).

So the updated states would be:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**.
