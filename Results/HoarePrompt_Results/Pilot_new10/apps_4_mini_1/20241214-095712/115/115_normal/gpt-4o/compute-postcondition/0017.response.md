According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute when `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2, which means `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Consequently, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (which it is).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `m - 1`**
