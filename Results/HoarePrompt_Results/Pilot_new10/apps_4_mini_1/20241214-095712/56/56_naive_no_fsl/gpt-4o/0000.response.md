To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we analyze its logic against the problem requirements. 

### Key Points from the Problem:
1. We need to find `k` integers such that the sum of `2` raised to these integers equals `n` and the maximum integer of these `k` integers should be as small as possible.
2. The output should be lexicographically largest when there are multiple valid sequences.
3. If it's impossible to form such a sequence, return "No".

### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
  
2. **Immediate Check**:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, it immediately returns "No", which is correct because you cannot have more powers of 2 adding up to a sum less than that many integers.
  
3. **Finding Powers of 2**:
   - The program generates a list of positions (`bits`) where `n` has its bits set (for each power of 2 that contributes to `n`).
   - If the number of bits is greater than `k`, it returns "No".

4. **Populating to Length `k`**:
   - The code extends the list of powers by popping the smallest current power and splitting it into two instances of the next smaller power. This is done until the length of `bits` equals `k`.
  
5. **Sorting**:
   - Finally, it ensures that `bits` are sorted in non-increasing (reverse) order to achieve lexicographically largest output.

### Potential Case for Incorrectness:
#### Test Input: `5 3`
**Expectation**: 
- The powers of 2 summing to `5` are `2^2 (4) + 2^0 (1)`. The maximum number of integers needed is `2` (which can just be `2, 0` or `2, -1, -1`). But we need to provide `3` integers since `k=3`.
 
**Execution**:
- The bits would be `[2, 0]`.
- The code would attempt to pop `0` and append `-1` twice, ultimately yielding `2, -1, -1`.
- The output would be `Yes` followed by `2 -1 -1`, which is lexicographically correct but doesn't sum to `5` correctly structured as specified in the problem.

After further examination, the program does not explicitly handle the case where having `k` greater than the number of bits leads to a mismatched sum validation against `n`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not satisfy the requirement in every potential edge case, specifically in the distribution of `k` integers and their capability to sum to `n`.

Correctness: **False**
