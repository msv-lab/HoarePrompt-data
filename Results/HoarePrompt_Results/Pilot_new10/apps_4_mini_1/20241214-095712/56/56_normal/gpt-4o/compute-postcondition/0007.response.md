Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list that includes the value 60 if the condition `n >> i & 1` is true, and `i` remains 60. If the condition is false, `bits` remains an empty list.***
