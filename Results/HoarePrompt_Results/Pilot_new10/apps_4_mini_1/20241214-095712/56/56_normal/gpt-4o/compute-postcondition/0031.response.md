The `bits` list is sorted in reverse order. The precondition states that `bits` contains the indices of set bits in `n` and some decremented values of the smallest elements. Sorting in reverse will not change the actual values contained within the list, only their order. The values of `n`, `k`, `smallest`, and the contents of `bits` remain unchanged apart from the order of `bits`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` is equal to `k`; `smallest` is the value of the last element removed from `bits` during the final execution; `bits` now contains the indices of set bits in `n` sorted in reverse order.**
