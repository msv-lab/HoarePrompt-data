Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` must be less than `k - 1`; `smallest` is the last element removed from the list `bits`; `bits` now includes the value `smallest - 1`.**
