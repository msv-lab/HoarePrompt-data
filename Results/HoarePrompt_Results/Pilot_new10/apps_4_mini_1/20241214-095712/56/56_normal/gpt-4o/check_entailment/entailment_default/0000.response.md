Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code attempts to generate a sequence of `k` integers such that the sum of \(2\) raised to the power of each integer equals \(n\). However, there are critical flaws in terms of edge cases and implementation logic that could lead to incorrect outputs.

1. **Check if k > n**: This check is not sufficient. While it protects against cases where all integers in the sequence would need to be positive and sum to \(n\), it fails when \(n\) is such that it's less than \(k\) when \(k\) includes negative values (e.g., the output can include negative powers of two, allowing fractions).

2. **Count of set bits**: The program checks the number of set bits (ones) in the binary representation of \(n\), and if it exceeds \(k\), it returns 'No'. However, this logic fails to consider that \(n\) can be constructed in various combinations, particularly with negative powers when aiming for sums involving fractions. 

3. **Exceeding k adjustments**: While the code attempts to balance bits until the count matches \(k\) by decrementing powers, this could produce invalid outputs for certain inputs. The logic does not correctly handle cases where there might not be enough values to reach \(k\) integers.

For instance, with input \(n = 13\) and \(k = 2\), the function will incorrectly output 'No', but it might actually be possible to represent \(n\) in such a way that the fraction considerations and negative powers could yield valid combinations.

Additionally, testing with other potential edge cases, such as \(n = 1\) and \(k = 3\), might yield incorrect results as the implementation might specify valid limits that do not fully respect the problem constraints and lexicographic orders as required.

Thus, due to flaws present in handling specific cases and potential miscalculations with certain \(n\) and \(k\) inputs, we conclude that the program does not fulfill all requirements fully as expected by the problem description.
