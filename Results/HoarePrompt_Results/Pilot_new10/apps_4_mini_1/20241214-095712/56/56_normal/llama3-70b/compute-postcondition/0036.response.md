Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is the total number of iterations executed, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, then values corresponding to the highest set bits encountered during each iteration are added to `a`. If the length of `a` is equal to `k`, then `a` remains sorted in descending order and is printed as space-separated values.***
