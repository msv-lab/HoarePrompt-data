According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` has been modified to `n - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must have originally been greater than 2. 

Since we know that `n` is now modified to `n - 2` and we need `n` to be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can run again, we can infer that `n` must currently be greater than 0 after being decreased by 2. 

To ensure this, `n` must be adjusted to be more than 2 (i.e., `n` must have been at least 3 before the last iteration). No other states need to be adjusted as `k` and `i` remain unchanged in the context of the loop condition.

State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is increased by 1**
