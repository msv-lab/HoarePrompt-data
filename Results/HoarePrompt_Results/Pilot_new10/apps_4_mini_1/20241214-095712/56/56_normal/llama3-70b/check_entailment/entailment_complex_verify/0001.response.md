Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because it highlights key issues in the program's logic, particularly its failure to account for scenarios where negative powers of two may need to be used to construct valid sequences. The program incorrectly determines the output for cases where it is possible to represent `n` using powers of two, including negative powers. This oversight in the code leads to incorrect outputs for valid inputs like `1 2`, which should output "Yes" and `-1 -1`, but results in "No" instead. 

The annotations clarify the state of variables and the logic in the program but do not rectify the fundamental flaw in handling the representation of `n` through varying combinations of powers of two. Hence, the original assessment's conclusion of "False" remains justified.
