The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on predefined constraints of `n` and `k`. Here, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\). The function returns a value based on the relationships between `n` and `k`. 

Since the exact output details stemming from these parameters are not provided, I cannot elaborate further on that. However, we can summarize the functionality considering the constraints of the inputs:

Functionality: **The function works based on the constraints of the positive integers n (with \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and k (with \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\)), and returns a value determined by these inputs.**
