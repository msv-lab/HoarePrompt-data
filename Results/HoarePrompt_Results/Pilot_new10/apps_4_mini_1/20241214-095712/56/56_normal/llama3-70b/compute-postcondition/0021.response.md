According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, no other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is increased by 1**
