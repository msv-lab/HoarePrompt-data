The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` to the console. This does not change any of the variables defined in the initial state; therefore, all variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer, `L` is a positive integer, and `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`. The value of `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`.**
