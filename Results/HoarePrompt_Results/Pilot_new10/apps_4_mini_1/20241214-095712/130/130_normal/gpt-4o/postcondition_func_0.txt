The function reads four positive integers `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` from input, calculates `min_x`, which represents the minimum number of `M` units needed to meet or exceed `L`. If the product of `M` and `min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, it prints the value of `min_x`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`. This means that if the remaining units available (given by `N - K`) cannot accommodate the required units to meet `L`, the function correctly returns `-1`. The function does not explicitly return any value, it only prints the result.
