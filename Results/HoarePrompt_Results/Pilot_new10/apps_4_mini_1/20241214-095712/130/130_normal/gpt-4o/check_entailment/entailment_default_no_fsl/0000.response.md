To determine the correctness of the given program in relation to the problem statement, let's analyze both the problem description and the program carefully.

### Problem Analysis
- **Inputs**: Four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), \(L\).
  - \(N\): Total different collectible coins.
  - \(M\): Number of friends gifting coins.
  - \(K\): Number of coins Ivan already has.
  - \(L\): Minimum number of new coins that must be given to Ivan.
  
- **Output**: The minimum number of coins each friend must gift so that all conditions are satisfied, or -1 if it is not possible.

### Conditions to Satisfy
1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All gifted coins must be different from each other and from what Ivan already has.
3. The total number of new coins that Ivan receives must be at least \(L\).

### Program Logic
- The program calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift in order to satisfy the requirement of having at least \(L\) new coins. This is computed as:
   ```python
   min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
   ```
- The program then checks if the total number of coins given by the friends does not exceed the number of available new coins Ivan can receive:
   ```python
   if M * min_x <= N - K:
   ```
- If the above condition is satisfied, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Checking for Edge Cases
1. **Case When `K` is Equal to `N`**:
   If Ivan already has all collectible coins (i.e., \(K = N\)), then no friends can give him any new coins. The program will output `-1` if \(L > 0\), which is correct.

2. **Case When `L > N - K`**:
   If the minimum number of new coins required \(L\) exceeds the number of new coins available (i.e., \(N - K\)), the program will also output `-1`. This is handled correctly.

3. **General Valid Cases**:
   The program seems to appropriately calculate the minimum gifts when enough different new coins are available.

### Counter-Example:
However, consider the following case:
- Input: `20 15 2 13`
  - Here, \(N = 20\), \(M = 15\), \(K = 2\), \(L = 13\).

   - According to the program, \(min_x = (13 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1\).
   - The program checks if \(15 * 1 <= 20 - 2\) (or \(15 <= 18\)), which is true.
   - The output will be `1`, suggesting each friend can give 1 coin, which results in only 15 coins gifted. However, since Ivan has only \(2\) coins, they all must be new but they are not: Thus total new coins can only be 15 max, contradicting the fact \(13\) are required.

### Conclusion
The program does not cover the scenario correctly where the number of friends \(M\) exceeds the logical limits on the new coins based on the values of \(N\), \(K\), and \(L\). It outputs an acceptable value while failing to satisfy the condition for new unique coins gifted.

Thus, the program is indeed incorrect for this scenario.

Correctness: **False**
