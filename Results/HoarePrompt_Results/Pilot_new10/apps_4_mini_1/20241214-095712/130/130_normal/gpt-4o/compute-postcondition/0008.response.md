The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it works with four positive integers: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, adhering to the constraints 1 ≤ K ≤ N, 1 ≤ M, and 1 ≤ L, with the maximum possible values for these integers being up to 10^18. 

The function's output and behavior are not specified in the provided information. Consequently, we lack explicit return conditions or values based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates with four positive integer constraints (N, M, K, L) but does not accept any parameters directly. The specific return values and behavior of the function are not defined.**
