The variables N, M, K, and L are assigned the values based on the inputs received from the `map(int, input().split())` function. Since the values are being directly assigned from input and their previous states are positive integers as per the constraints, the previous values of N, M, K, and L are replaced. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **N is a positive integer, M is a positive integer, K is a positive integer, L is a positive integer, where N, M, K, and L are set to the values from the input.**
