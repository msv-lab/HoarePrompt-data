To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic against the problem description and various edge cases.

The conditions to determine if the friends can gift coins correctly are:

1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All coins gifted must be different.
3. At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

The provided program checks:

1. If the number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to the total number of different coins minus those Ivan already has plus one (`N - K + 1`). This checks not only if all friends can give different coins but also ensures that the number of friends is not less than the new required coins.
2. It also checks if the number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, which ensures the gifts contain at least `L` new coins.

### Analysis of the Conditions

Let's consider a few cases:

- **Case when K = N**: If Ivan has all possible coins (e.g., K = 20, N = 20, regardless of M and L), then he can't receive any new coins, making it impossible for any friends to satisfy the requirement of L new coins. The output should be `-1`, but this is not covered by the combined condition that checks `M >= N - K + 1`.

- **Case when M > N - K**: If there are more friends than unique coins available excluding Ivan's collection, then the program should output `-1`, indicating that it's impossible for each friend to gift different coins. However, the check `if M >= N - K + 1` doesn't fully cover situations where M exceeds the distinct coins available.

- **Minimum quantity check**: The program outputs `1` if the conditions are satisfied, which means it assumes that giving one coin from each friend might suffice. However, if there's a scenario where M friends can't give at least L new coins, the program fails to check adequately.

### Examples That Break the Program
- Input: `20 15 20 3` (Here `K = N`, so Ivan has all coins, thus no new coins can be given, output should be `-1`, but with this code, it evaluates to `1`, which is incorrect.)
  
- Input: `10 11 2 4` (Even if it returns `-1`, it fails the two checks mentioned where it would otherwise return `1` for cases that shouldn't be possible.)

### Conclusion
The program both doesn't handle the case where Ivan has all coins and makes incorrect assumptions about the ability of M friends to gift different types of coins. Thus, for one or more potential cases identified above, the program can deliver incorrect results regarding the problemâ€™s requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
