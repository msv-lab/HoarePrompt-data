The statement `costs = list(map(int, input().split()))` creates a new list `costs` by converting the input values (which are strings) to integers. This means that `costs` will now hold these integer values. The previous list `c` remains unchanged, but the new `costs` list will have the same length `n` since the input must contain exactly `n` integers.

Since `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, the `costs` list will consist of `n` integers converted from the input. Each integer in `costs` will satisfy the same constraints as the integers in `c`, meaning 1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9 for all valid `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `c` remains a list of n integers where each integer c[i] satisfies 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of n integers converted from input with each costs[i] satisfying 1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9.**
