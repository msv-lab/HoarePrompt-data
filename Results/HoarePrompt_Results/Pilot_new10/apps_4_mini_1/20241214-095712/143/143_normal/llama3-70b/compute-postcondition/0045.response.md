The variable `j` is equal to `n`. The expression `vol` is assigned the value `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is equal to `n`, we can rewrite this as `vol = 2 ** n - 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `vol` will be calculated as `2 ** n - 1`, which results in a range of values depending on `n`.

The states of the other variables `L`, `c`, and `costs` remain the same as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers such that each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of `n` integers such that each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9; `j` is equal to `n`; `vol` is equal to `2 ** n - 1`.**
