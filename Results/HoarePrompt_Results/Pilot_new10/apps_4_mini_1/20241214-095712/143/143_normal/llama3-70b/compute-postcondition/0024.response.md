Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[1]` is equal to the minimum of all `costs[j]`. If the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`, with `i` incremented by 1, and `j` remains 0.***
