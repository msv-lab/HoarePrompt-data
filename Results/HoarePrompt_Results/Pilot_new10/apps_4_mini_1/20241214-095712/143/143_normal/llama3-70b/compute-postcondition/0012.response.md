Initial State: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers converted from input where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[1]` is equal to `costs[0]`, `dp[0]` is 0, all other `dp` values remain float('inf'), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1.

The statement `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])` calculates the value for `dp[1]`. 

- Since `i` is 1 and `vol` is 1, this leads to the calculation of `dp[1] = min(dp[1], dp[1 - 1] + costs[1])`, which simplifies to `dp[1] = min(dp[1], dp[0] + costs[1])`.
- From the initial conditions, `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is equal to `costs[0]`.
  
Now, let's denote the initial value of `dp[1]` as `dp[1] = costs[0]`.

Putting this all together:
- `dp[1]` would now be updated to `min(costs[0], costs[1])`.

Other variables are not affected, thus the output state retains their values.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers converted from input where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is equal to `min(costs[0], costs[1])`, all other `dp` values remain float('inf'), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1.**
