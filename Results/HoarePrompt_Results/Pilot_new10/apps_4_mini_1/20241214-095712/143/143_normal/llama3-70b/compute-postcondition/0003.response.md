Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `c` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of `n` integers converted from input with each `costs[i]` satisfying 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9; `dp` is a list of size `L + 1`, where dp[0] is now 0 and all other elements remain float('inf').**
