The variable `j` is assigned the value of `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\). Therefore, when calculating `vol`, we use the value of `j` as equal to `n`. The expression \(2^j - 1\) will produce a result based on the value of `n`. Thus, `vol` is calculated as \(2^n - 1\). 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers such that each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers such that each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `j` is equal to `n`, `vol` is equal to `2^n - 1`.**
