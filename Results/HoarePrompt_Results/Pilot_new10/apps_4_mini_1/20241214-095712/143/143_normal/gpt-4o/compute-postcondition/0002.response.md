The list `c` is generated by combining the existing `costs` list with a portion of the `max_cost` repeated enough times to fill the list up to a length of 31. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, the length of `costs` is `n`, and therefore `len(costs)` is equal to `n`. The number of times `max_cost` needs to be repeated is calculated as `31 - n`. 

As a result, `c` becomes a list that consists of the elements in `costs` followed by `(31 - n)` occurrences of `max_cost`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each cost is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 integers equal to 10, `c` is a list of `n` integers from `costs` followed by `31 - n` occurrences of 10.**
