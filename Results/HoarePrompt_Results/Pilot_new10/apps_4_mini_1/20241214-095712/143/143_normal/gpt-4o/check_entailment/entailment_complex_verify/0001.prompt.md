You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given program, let's break down its logic and compare it to the problem description.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - We need to buy lemonade in bottles with volumes defined as `2^i - 1` liters and find the minimum cost to get at least `L` liters.
   - The costs vary for each type of bottle.

2. **Checking the program's logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a large constant (`max_cost`) to simulate infinity for the purposes of finding a minimum cost.
   - It creates a dynamic programming array `dp` to keep track of the minimum cost for obtaining certain volumes of lemonade.
   - The cost for each bottle type is assigned to `dp[i]` for the respective type and then, starting from previously calculated volumes, it doubles the cost to consider larger volume bottles.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to fulfill at least `L` liters by adding costs from the largest possible volumes downwards.

3. **Finding an edge case**:
   - Consider the input where we have a need for exactly one liter of lemonade, and the cheapest available cost is very high for that volume but low for higher volumes. 
   - For example, with the input:
     ```
     3 1
     100 10 5
     ```
     Here, the bottle volumes would be 1 liter (cost 100), 3 liters (cost 10), and 7 liters (cost 5).
   - The correct answer should be to buy one 3-liter bottle for 10 roubles because that meets the requirement of at least 1 liter effectively at a lower cost than buying a 1-liter bottle for 100 roubles. 
   - However, there could be a logical flaw related to how it decides to use costs based on the leftover liters after fulfilling `L`. The current logic does not specifically consider optimizing costs when large capacities are available right from the start.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly handle situations where higher volume bottles (larger than what is minimally required) might be cheaper or more effective compared to sticking to the smallest required volume bottles. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on potential edge cases leads us to conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

Specific case failing: The case `3 1` with costs `100 10 5` returns an incorrect minimum if it only focuses on filling up through the minimum 1-liter cost. It should find that the 3-liter option is cheaper for at least 1 litter, thus indicating a flaw in optimization.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive, L is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and costs is a list of n integers where each cost is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding `c[i]`, `dp[i]` remains 10 for `i` in range `n` to 30 except the modified indices.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n + 1` to `31` is 10.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `30` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `31` is 10; `current_cost` is equal to the sum of relevant `dp[i]` values based on the decremented `L`; `L` is non-negative and possibly zero; `answer` is the minimum of the initial `max_cost` and `current_cost` after all iterations.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum of the initial max_cost and current_cost, where current_cost is the sum of relevant dp[i] values based on the decremented L, and dp[i] for i in range 1 to 30 is adjusted to account for the minimum of its original value and 2 * dp[i - 1].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (between 1 and 30), an integer `L` (between 1 and 10^9), and a list `costs` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It computes a minimum cost based on dynamic programming, adjusting costs according to specific rules. The function returns the minimum value between `max_cost` and `current_cost`, where `current_cost` is derived from the accumulated `dp` values based on the powers of two that fit within `L`. Notably, if `L` is zero before adding any `dp[i]`, the function may still return `max_cost` if `current_cost` is zero or less than any applicable modifications.
