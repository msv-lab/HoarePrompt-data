The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. The initial state indicates that `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, the values of `dp[i]` from 1 to `n` depend on their original values and are not explicitly stated, while for `i` from `n + 1` to `31`, `dp[i]` has a value of `10`. The variable `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, which is also not defined here. Therefore, the Output State summarizes the existing valid precondition information and updates the value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n + 1` to `31` is 10; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`; `current_cost` is 0.**
