#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive, L is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and costs is a list of n integers where each cost is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding `c[i]`, `dp[i]` remains 10 for `i` in range `n` to 30 except the modified indices.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n + 1` to `31` is 10.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `30` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `31` is 10; `current_cost` is equal to the sum of relevant `dp[i]` values based on the decremented `L`; `L` is non-negative and possibly zero; `answer` is the minimum of the initial `max_cost` and `current_cost` after all iterations.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum of the initial max_cost and current_cost, where current_cost is the sum of relevant dp[i] values based on the decremented L, and dp[i] for i in range 1 to 30 is adjusted to account for the minimum of its original value and 2 * dp[i - 1].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (between 1 and 30), an integer `L` (between 1 and 10^9), and a list `costs` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It computes a minimum cost based on dynamic programming, adjusting costs according to specific rules. The function returns the minimum value between `max_cost` and `current_cost`, where `current_cost` is derived from the accumulated `dp` values based on the powers of two that fit within `L`. Notably, if `L` is zero before adding any `dp[i]`, the function may still return `max_cost` if `current_cost` is zero or less than any applicable modifications.
