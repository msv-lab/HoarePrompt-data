To solve this, we start with the provided Initial State and consider the impact of the code:

1. `current_cost` is initially 0.
2. `i` is initially 30, which is within the range of the defined states for `dp[i]`.
3. We know that `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `n` is the minimum of its original value and `2 * dp[i - 1]`. Given that `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, `dp[30]` has been set according to this rule.
4. The code statement `current_cost += dp[i]` means we are adding the value of `dp[30]` to `current_cost`.

Since we aren't provided with the specific value of `dp[30]`, we can assume from the logic described that it is a value dependent on the prior `dp` values, specifically tailored by the rules given. However, regardless of its exact initial value, the operation will yield a new cost.

Assuming the value of `dp[30]` complies with the predefined constructs, we rewrite:

- If `dp[30]` was valid and derived as per the conditions laid out, after executing `current_cost += dp[30]`, the new value for `current_cost` will simply be `dp[30]` (since `current_cost` was initially 0).

Thus our outputs will retain previous states unchanged, plus show that `current_cost` now equals `dp[30]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`, `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n + 1` to `31` is 10; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`; `current_cost` is equal to `dp[30]`; `i` is 30; the value of `L` is greater than or equal to `2^i` (which is 1 shifted left by `i`).**
