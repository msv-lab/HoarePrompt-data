The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. Since `i` is 29, we add `dp[29]` to `current_cost`. The state of `n`, `dp`, `i`, `L`, and `answer` remains unchanged. However, the value of `current_cost` will be updated to reflect the addition of `dp[29]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `30` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `31` is 10; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`; `i` is 29; `L` is equal to its previous value minus `2^29` if `L >= 1 << 29; answer is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`.**
