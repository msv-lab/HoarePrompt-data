The value of `mex` is assigned the value of 1. The initial state does not affect the variable `mex`, so `mex` is now explicitly set to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 1**.
