Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 2; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n`; if `num` (the first element of `arr`) equals `mex`, then `mex` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `num` is greater than `mex`, which is 1, causing a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
