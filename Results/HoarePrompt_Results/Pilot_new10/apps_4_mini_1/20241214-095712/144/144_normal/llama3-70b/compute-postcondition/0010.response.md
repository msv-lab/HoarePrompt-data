Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 1; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n`; `num`, which is the first element of `arr` not equal to `mex`, is greater than `mex` and causes a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
