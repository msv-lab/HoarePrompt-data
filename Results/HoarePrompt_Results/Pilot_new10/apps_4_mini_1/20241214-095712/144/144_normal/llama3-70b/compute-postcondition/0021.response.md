Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 4; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements; if `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is set to 4; otherwise, if `num` is greater than `mex`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
