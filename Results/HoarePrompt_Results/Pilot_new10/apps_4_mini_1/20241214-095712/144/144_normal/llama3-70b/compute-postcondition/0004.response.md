According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. The loop iterates over each element in `arr`, and since `arr` is not mentioned in the provided state, we need to clarify that `arr` should be defined. The conditions state that `n` is a positive integer, but we must also consider the size of `arr`. 

For the loop to execute, `arr` must be a list that contains integers, and it should have a length of `n`. Since `arr` is an essential part of the for loop, it needs to be established as a sorted list of `n` positive integers.

So, for the loop to be executed:
- `arr` must be defined as a sorted list of positive integers with length equal to `n`.
- The first iteration will start with `num` being the first element of `arr`.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n`, and `num` is the first element of `arr`**.
