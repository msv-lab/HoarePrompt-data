The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and `a`, which is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs but does not specify its output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n positive integers.**
