The variable `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `mex`, but it is implied that it is an integer. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains valid and updates only the `mex` variable, while retaining the conditions for `n`, `a`, and `num`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mex` is incremented by 1**.
