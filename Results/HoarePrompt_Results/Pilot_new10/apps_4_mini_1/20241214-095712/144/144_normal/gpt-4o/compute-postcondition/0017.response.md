The function `func` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It calculates the smallest positive integer (referred to as `mex`) that is not present in the list `a`. The list `a` is sorted, and the function iterates through the sorted list, incrementing `mex` whenever it finds an integer in `a` that is greater than or equal to `mex`. Finally, it prints the resulting `mex`. 

The code assumes that the input adheres to the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 and 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9), but there is no validation for the input format. Additionally, if `n` is 0 (though the prompt implies it will be at least 1), the function expects input according to defined constraints, which could lead to unexpected behavior if those constraints are violated.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers, calculates the smallest positive integer not present in the list, and prints it. It assumes valid input based on predefined constraints. **
