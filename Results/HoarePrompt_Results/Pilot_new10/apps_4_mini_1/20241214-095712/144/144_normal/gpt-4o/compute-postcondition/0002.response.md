The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in non-decreasing order. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it still represents the number of elements in the list `a`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. The list `a` will now contain its elements in sorted order, but the exact values of its newly sorted elements depend on the initial input.

Therefore, the Output State captures the validity of `n`, along with the transformation of `a`:

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers obtained from input, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9`.**
