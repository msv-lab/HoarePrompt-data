The variable `cnt_3` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an input and converts it to an integer. The previous value of `cnt_3` as a non-negative integer is now updated to be whatever non-negative integer is provided as the input but will remain within the range of 0 to \(10^9\). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^9, `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer.**
