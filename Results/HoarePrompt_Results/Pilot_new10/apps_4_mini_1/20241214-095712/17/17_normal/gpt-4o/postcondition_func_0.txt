The function does not accept any parameters and reads four non-negative integers from input. It checks if the sum of the first two integers equals the sum of the last two integers and if the second integer is greater than or equal to the third integer. It prints `1` if both conditions are met; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not handle any edge cases for invalid inputs, and it relies on the assumption that the inputs will always be within the specified range (0 to 10^9).
