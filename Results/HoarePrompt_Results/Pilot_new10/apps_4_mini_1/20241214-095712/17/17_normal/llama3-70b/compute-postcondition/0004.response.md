The code executes a `print` statement that outputs the integer value `1`. The variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged and retain their previous integer values. The state of the variables does not change, so the output state will include the information that has not changed along with an indication that `1` has been printed.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are integers, `cnt_3` is less than or equal to `cnt_1`, and `1` has been printed.**
