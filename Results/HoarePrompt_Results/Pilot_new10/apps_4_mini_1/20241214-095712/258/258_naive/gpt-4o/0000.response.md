To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to scrutinize the logic implemented in the program and assess whether it fulfills all requirements stated in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We are tasked with finding the optimal placing of a heat source to grill `K` out of `N` pieces of meat on a 2D grid, based on their respective coordinates and hardness. The time taken for each piece of meat to be ready is determined by its distance from the heat source scaled by its hardness.

2. **Functions Overview**:
   - `func_1(meats, K, T)`: This function checks whether it is possible to have at least `K` pieces of meat ready within time `T` by evaluating the average positions of pairs of meats.
   - `func_2(N, K, meats)`: This function performs a binary search over potential times `T` to accurately hone in on the minimal required time to achieve the goal.
   - `func_3()`: This function reads input, processes it, and outputs the result after calling the computation functions.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic in `func_1` assesses whether the calculated coordinates can reach `K` pieces of meat within the set time, utilizing the midpoint of pairs of meats. However, the algorithm may overlook optimal positions that do not lie precisely between any two pieces of meat. This could lead to missing configurations that would yield a minimal grilling time, especially if the optimal point is not on the line segment joining any two meat positions.

4. **Specific Case That Can Cause Incorrectness**:
   - Consider a case with three pieces of meat placed in such a way that the optimal grilling location is not midway between any two of the pieces:
     ```
     Input:
     3 2
     0 0 1
     2 0 1
     0 2 1
     
     Expected Output: A point where at least two pieces can be grilled optimally.
     ```
   - In this configuration, the heat source could be optimally placed at `(0,1)` or `(1,0)` to minimize grilling time for pieces `(0,0)` and `(0,2)`, but this will not be evaluated as the function `func_1` only considers the midpoints directly between pairs.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not handle cases where the optimal heat source position is not located between any two meat pieces properly, leading to a scenario where the output might fail to reflect the true minimal time needed to grill `K` pieces of meat.

Correctness: **False**.
