Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct because it has a logical flaw in the implementation of `func_2` and `func_3`. 

1. **Scoping Issue in `func_2`:** The function `func_2` refers to the variable `meats`, which is not defined within the function's scope. This will lead to a `NameError` if `meats` is not globally accessible when `func_2` is called. The definition of `meats` should either be passed as a parameter to `func_2` or defined within the function.

2. **Unaddressed Index Error in `func_3`:** In `func_3`, after sorting the list `times`, the code attempts to access `times[K - 1]`. If `K` is greater than the number of pieces of meat that can be prepared (e.g., if K > N, which is not allowed by constraints but could lead to confusion), there is no error handling for this case. As defined by input constraints, this should not happen, yet the handling of indices without checks is risky.

3. **Optimal Placement of Heat Source:** The method of brute-force checking every integer coordinate between -1000 to 1000 does not consider that the optimal placement may not necessarily lie on integer coordinates. The problem statement implies that X and Y can be real numbers, necessitating a more refined search approach, such as numeric optimization methods.

4. **Output Requirements:** The output requires a precision constraint (an absolute or relative error from the correct answer should be at most 10^{-6}). The current implementation does not appear to handle the final output precision.

These points illustrate that the program may not function correctly in various scenarios, particularly due to the unguarded access of variables and potential logical failures. Thus, the code does not meet the problem description reliably in all potential cases.
