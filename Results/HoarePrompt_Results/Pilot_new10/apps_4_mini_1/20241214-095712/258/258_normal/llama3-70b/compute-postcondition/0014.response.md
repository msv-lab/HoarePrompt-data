To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze how each variable's value relates to the loop's operations, acknowledging the boundaries set by the initial state.

Given that the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 for the variable `y`, it clearly suggests that `y` will take each integer value in this range during the loop's execution.

The critical aspect of the loop involves invoking `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to generate the `times`, which is then sorted, and updates the `ans` to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and the K-th element of the sorted `times`.

After the loop has executed entirely, the following values and relationships hold:
- The variable `y` will take its last value of 1000 after the completion of the loop.
- The list `times` will have been populated for each value of `y` from -1000 to 1000, meaning that its final value will depend on the specific outputs of `func_2` but cannot be explicitly detailed without further specifics.
- The variable `ans` will store the minimum of all `times[K - 1]`, ensuring it holds the minimum of the K-th sorted elements generated throughout all iterations.

It should also be noted that `K` will remain unchanged, as it doesn't get modified within the loop. 

Thus, if the loop executes completely, we have the following output state:

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is a list containing sorted values generated from the function calls for all values of `y` from -1000 to 1000.**
