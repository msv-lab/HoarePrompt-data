The code assigns `ans` the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`. The value of `ans` is originally equal to `times[K - 1]`, so the expression evaluates to the minimum of `times[K - 1]` and itself, leaving `ans` unchanged. Since `times` is sorted and `K` is guaranteed to be a valid positive integer index, the conditions around the values of other variables do not affect this specific computation.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `x` is -1000; `y` is -998; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]` after sorting (unchanged)**.
