To analyze the impact of the code, we need to understand what `func_2` does, but since it is not specified, we can only assume it returns a list of values based on `x` and `y`. 

Given that `x` and `y` are both -998 and that `K` is a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, we can expect that `times` will be generated as a sorted list from the function.

Since `times` is defined as the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, the output state for `times` is unknown as we do not have specific details on the implementation of `func_2`. However, it is sorted and its length should be at least `K`.

After `times` is generated, the variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. 

Since `ans` is assigned the minimum value, if we denote the previous value of `ans` as `previous_ans` and have `times[K - 1]`, the result for `ans` following the assignment would be `min(previous_ans, times[K - 1])`.

Thus the output state reflects these considerations without specific values for `times` and assuming `func_2` behaves consistently.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is the output of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)` which is sorted, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**.
