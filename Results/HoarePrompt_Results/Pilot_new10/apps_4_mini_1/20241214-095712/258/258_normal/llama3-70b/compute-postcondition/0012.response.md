Given the initial state, the impact of the provided code is that it sorts the list `times`. The variables in this state are not directly affected in terms of their values other than the sorting of the `times` list itself. The previous values described in the initial state still hold, except for `times`, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `x` is -1000; `y` is -998; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]` after sorting.**
