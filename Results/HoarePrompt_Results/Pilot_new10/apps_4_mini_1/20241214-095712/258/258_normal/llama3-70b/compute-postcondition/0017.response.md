In the code snippet provided, the statement assigns the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. Here, `x` is a specific value of -999, while `y` is iterated across the range from -1000 to 1000 during the loop. The output variable `ans` is determined as the minimum value of `times[K - 1]`.

The impact of the code suggests that:
- The variable `times` is assigned a value that results from the function `func_2`, which takes the current values of `x` and iterated `y` into consideration.
- The value of `ans` is then computed as the minimum of the specific list `times` at index `K - 1`.

However, without specific knowledge of the implementation details of `func_2`, we can only define that `times` will be dependent on the values of `x` and `y`, and `ans` will depend on the values contained in the `times` list.

Therefore, the output state needs to reflect that `times` is now assigned a value based on the provided function. Given that the initial state remains valid except for the changes corresponding to `times`, the output would be:

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` will be iterated from -1000 to 1000 during the loop, `times` is assigned the result of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`, and `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.**
