The function `func_1` accepts four real number parameters `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which represent the coordinates of a piece of meat and a heat source respectively. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two points (x, y) and (X, Y) using the distance formula. There are no constraints on the input values, and it handles all real numbers, including negative coordinates.
