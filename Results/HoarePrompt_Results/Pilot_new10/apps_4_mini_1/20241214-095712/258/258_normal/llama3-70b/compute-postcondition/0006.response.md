According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of values from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `y` is currently at -1000. Since `y` will increase by 1 for each subsequent iteration, it will take on the values from -1000 up to 1000.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be -999, as the next value in the range is -999 (considering the increment). Additionally, the other variables will remain unchanged as the loop does not affect `K`, `x`, or `ans`.

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
