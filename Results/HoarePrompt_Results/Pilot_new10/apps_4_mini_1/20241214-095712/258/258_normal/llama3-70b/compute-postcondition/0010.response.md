According to the code, the range for the loop runs from -1000 to 1000. The loop variable `y` starts at -1000 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` would be at its current value, and in order for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `y` is currently -999 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be -998.

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `x` is -1000; `y` is -998; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]` after sorting.**
