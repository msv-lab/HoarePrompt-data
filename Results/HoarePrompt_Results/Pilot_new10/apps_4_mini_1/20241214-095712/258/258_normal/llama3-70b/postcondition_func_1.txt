The function accepts four real number parameters: `x` and `y` representing the coordinates of a heat source, and `X` and `Y` representing the coordinates of a piece of meat. It returns a list that calculates the contribution from each tuple in the `meats` list based on the output of `func_1(x, y, X, Y)` multiplied by the `c_i` values from the tuples in the list. However, the variable `meats` is not defined within the function, which could lead to a `NameError` if `meats` is not in the scope, indicating a missing context for its definition and potential error handling.
