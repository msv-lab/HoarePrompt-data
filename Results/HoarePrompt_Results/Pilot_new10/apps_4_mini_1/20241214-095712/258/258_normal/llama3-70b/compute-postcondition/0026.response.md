Given the task, I will analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is the output of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

The code snippet `times.sort()` will sort the `times` list in ascending order. The other variables `K`, `x`, `y` do not change as a result of this operation.

Since `times` is the output of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, we don't know its specific content but we do know that it is sorted in non-decreasing order after this operation.

Considering all information given in the initial state, the only change is that `times` has been sorted. 

Because we must speak in general terms regarding `times`, we acknowledge that the sorted version of it has been created without altering `x`, `y`, or `K`. 

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` has been sorted in ascending order.**
