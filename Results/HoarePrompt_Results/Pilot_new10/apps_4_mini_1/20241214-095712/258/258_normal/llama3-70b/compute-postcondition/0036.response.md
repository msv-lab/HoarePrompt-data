The `times` variable, which stores the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, will be sorted in ascending order. The sorted order will change the arrangement of the elements in `times`, but the actual content of `times` is not known prior to sorting. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains influenced by `times[K - 1]`, which could be a different value after sorting. 

Since `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N`, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its previous value and the value at the (K-1)th index of the newly sorted `times`.

However, without specific values for `times`, we cannot determine an exact new value for `ans`. The information that is valid after executing the code includes the randomness of the `times` values post-sort and the fact that `ans` is now minimized with respect to the new order of `times`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**.
