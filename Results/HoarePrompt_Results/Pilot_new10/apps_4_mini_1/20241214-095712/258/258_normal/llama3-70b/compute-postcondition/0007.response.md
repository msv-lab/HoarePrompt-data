In this case, the variable `times` is assigned the output of the function `func_2`, which takes the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state indicates that `x` is -1000 and `y` is -999, so the function effectively runs with `-1000` and `-999` as its inputs. 

The variable `ans` is computed based on the previously defined value of `times[K - 1]`. However, since we do not know the output of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `times` or `ans` without that information. 

Thus, while `times` is altered, the exact content of `times` and subsequently `ans` cannot be explicitly expressed. We do know that the valid condition for `K` holds after this assignment since `1 <= K <= N`. 

Given these considerations, the updated output state accounts for the change to `times`, without detailing its content:

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `times` has been updated by calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`.**
