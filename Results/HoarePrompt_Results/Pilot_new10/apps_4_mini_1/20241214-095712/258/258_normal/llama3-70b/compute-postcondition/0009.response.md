The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value (`ans`) and the value at index `K - 1` of the sorted list `times`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`, so after applying the `min` function, `ans` retains the value of `times[K - 1]` since it is compared with itself. Thus, `ans` does not change. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `x` is -1000; `y` is -999; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]` after sorting.**
