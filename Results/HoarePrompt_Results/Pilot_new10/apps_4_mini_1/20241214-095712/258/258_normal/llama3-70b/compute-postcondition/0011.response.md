To analyze the provided code snippet and its effect on the initial state, let's break it down:

- The variable `times` is assigned the output of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.
- The values of `x` and `y` are given as -1000 and -998, respectively.

Since we do not know the implementation details of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `times`. However, the variable `ans` still refers to a specific value derived from `times` after it has been assigned.

The initial condition specifies that `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]` after sorting.

Given that `K` is a positive integer constrained by `1 <= K <= N`, we can imply that `times` should be a list or collection with at least `K` elements, and after calling `func_2`, `times` is assigned a new value which likely depends on `x` and `y`.

Since we can't determine the exact contents or the sorting outcome of `times`, we continue with the understanding that:

1. `times` has been defined based on the function's return value.
2. `K` and `N` remain unchanged through this operation.
3. The value of `ans` may change depending on the contents of `times` after execution of `func_2`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated context of the variables, particularly highlighting the change in `times`:

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `x` is -1000; `y` is -998; `times` is updated to the output of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` and `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]` after sorting.**
