The effect of the code `times.sort()` is to sort the list stored in the variable `times`. The other variables `K`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Since `times` was previously assigned the output of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, it now has a sorted order based on whatever values were originally produced by that function. However, since we don't have specific values for `times`, we can't detail its content after sorting.

Thus, the current output state reflects that `times` is now sorted, while the other variables remain in their prior states. 

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
