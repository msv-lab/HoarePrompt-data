Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), ..., (int(data[3N-3]), int(data[3N-2]), int(data[3N-1]))`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is `2 + 3 * N`; `x` is equal to `int(data[3N-3])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[3N-2])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[3N-1])`; the result has been returned from `func_2(N, K, meats)`.**
