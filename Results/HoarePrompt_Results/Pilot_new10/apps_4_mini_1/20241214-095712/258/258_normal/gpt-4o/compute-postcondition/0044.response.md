The variable `my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The values of `cy` and `dx` remain unchanged, but `my` will be calculated based on the values of `d2`, `d`, and `dx`. Since other variables are not affected by this assignment, we note only the change to `my`.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i` remain unchanged; `count` remains less than `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2 * (x1 - x2) / 2 + (y1 - y2) / 2 * (y1 - y2) / 2; the program continues execution if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
