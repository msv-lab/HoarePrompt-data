The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed with the next iteration. Since the execution of `continue` does not modify any variable values and only affects the flow of the loop, the output state remains unchanged for any variables in the current context.

Output State: **`meats` and `K` remain unchanged, `N` is greater than `1`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, which is negative, and the current value of `d` is less than 0.**
