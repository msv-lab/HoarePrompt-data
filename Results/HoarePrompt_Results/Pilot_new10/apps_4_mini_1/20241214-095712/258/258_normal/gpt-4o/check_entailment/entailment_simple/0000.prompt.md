You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integer values (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the pieces of meat, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats), and T is a positive real number representing time.
def func_1(meats, K, T):
    N = len(meats)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
            x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]
            if c1 * T < c2 * T:
                x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2 = x2, y2, c2, x1, y1, c1
            d = c1 * T - c2 * T
            if d < 0:
                continue
            d /= c1 * c2
            cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
            cy = (y1 + y2) / 2
            dx = (x1 - x2) / 2

                continue
            mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
            my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
            count = sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T for x, y,
                c in meats)
            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` remains unchanged; `K` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `count` is the number of elements in `meats` that satisfy the condition defined by the distances from the calculated midpoint `(mx, my)` to each point in `meats`, specifically such that the distance is less than or equal to `T`; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function has determined a valid configuration and would theoretically return `True`; if `count` is less than `K`, the function completes without returning any value, leaving all else unchanged.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the count of elements in 'meats' that satisfy the distance condition is less than 'K'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled where 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples, each tuple containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with constraints -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.

    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is approximately equal to `high`, with both less than `1e-07` difference. The final value of `mid` represents the maximum hardness threshold for grilling `K` pieces of meat, where `N` is the initial count of meat, and `K` is the count of pieces to grill. `meats` retains its original list of tuples containing their coordinates and hardness.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which is approximately equal to low, and both are less than 1e-07 difference, representing the maximum hardness threshold for grilling K pieces of meat.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 1 and 60, K is an integer between 1 and N, and meats is a list of tuples, each containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2

        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is between 1 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), ..., (int(data[3N-3]), int(data[3N-2]), int(data[3N-1]))`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is `2 + 3 * N`; `x` is equal to `int(data[3N-3])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[3N-2])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[3N-1])`.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
