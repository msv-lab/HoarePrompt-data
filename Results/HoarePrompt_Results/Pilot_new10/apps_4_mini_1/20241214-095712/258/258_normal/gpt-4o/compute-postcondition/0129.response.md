The value of `dy` is assigned as `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The variables `K` and `N` remain unchanged, and since `d` is defined as `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, it implies that the conditions for `my` are still valid, but `my` itself is not updated in this execution. The other variables `j`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, and `dx` remain as defined. 

Output State: **If `d` is less than 0, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; K remains unchanged, N remains unchanged, j is equal to i + 2, d is equal to (c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2), cx is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2.**
