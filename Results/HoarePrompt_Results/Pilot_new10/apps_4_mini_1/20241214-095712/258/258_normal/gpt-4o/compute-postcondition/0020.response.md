The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`, where `index` is currently 10. Therefore, `c` becomes `int(data[12])`. The previous state of `c` is as per the value derived from `int(data[8])`. 

Other variables remain unaffected. The output state shows the updated value of `c`.

Output State: **`N` is between 10 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` contains additional tuple `(x, int(data[11]), c)`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 10; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`; `c` is now equal to `int(data[12])`.**
