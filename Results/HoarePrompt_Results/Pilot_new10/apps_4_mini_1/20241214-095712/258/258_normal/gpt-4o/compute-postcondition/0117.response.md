According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `N`. The loop starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `N - 1`. If `j` starts at `i + 1`, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was at `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` is now `i + 2`, and for the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 2**.
