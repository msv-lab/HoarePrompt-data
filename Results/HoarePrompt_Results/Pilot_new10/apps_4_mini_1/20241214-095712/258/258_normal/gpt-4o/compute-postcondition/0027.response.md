Functionality: ** The function accepts input data which includes two integers, N (between 1 and 60) and K (between 1 and N), followed by a list of N tuples, each containing three integers (x, y, c) conforming to specified constraints. It processes this input to call another function with these parameters to compute a result, which it prints formatted to six decimal places. However, the function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or where K is greater than N, nor does it validate the ranges of x, y, and c beyond their type. **
