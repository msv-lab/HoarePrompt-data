To evaluate the impact of the code snippet provided, we need to analyze the variable `my` based on the given initial state.

Initial State: 
- `meats` remains unchanged
- `K` remains unchanged
- `N` remains unchanged
- `i` is less than `N`
- `j` is greater than `i`
- `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` maintain their previous values
- `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`
- `c1 * T` still does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value
- `d` remains a negative value after calculation
- loop continues to the next iteration
- `cx` is equal to the previous value of `x2`
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is 0
- `dy` is now equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is equal to `dy * dy`
- `d * d2` is greater than `d2`
- `mx` is equal to `previous value of x2 + (dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`

Now examining the assignment:
```
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

Given the current values:
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `0`
- `d2` is `dy * dy`

The calculation simplifies:
- Since `dx` is `0`, the term `dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` becomes `0`.
- Therefore, `my` is simply equal to `cy`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as there are no further modifications from the provided code. The only variable that has been updated is `my`.

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `K` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` maintain their previous values; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`; `c1 * T` still does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value; `d` remains a negative value after calculation; loop continues to the next iteration; `cx` is equal to the previous value of `x2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is now equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dy * dy`; `d * d2` is greater than `d2`; `mx` is equal to `previous value of x2 + (dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2); `my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
