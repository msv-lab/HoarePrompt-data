The statement `x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]` assigns the values from `meats[j]` to the variables `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` remain unchanged, as they are assigned from `meats[i]`. The initial state indicates that `i` is less than `N`, and `j` is greater than `i`, meaning `j` is a valid index for accessing `meats`.

The values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` now depend on the contents of the `meats` list at index `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values of `meats[j]`.**
