Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `count` is still less than `K`; if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, then `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2}{4} + \frac{(y1 - y2)^2}{4}\).***
