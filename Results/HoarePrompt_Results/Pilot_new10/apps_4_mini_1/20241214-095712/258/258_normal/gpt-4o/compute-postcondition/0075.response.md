The assignment operation will swap the values of the variables as follows: 
- `x1` takes the value of `x2`
- `y1` takes the value of `y2`
- `c1` takes the value of `c2`
- `x2` takes the value of `x1`
- `y2` takes the value of `y1`
- `c2` takes the value of `c1`

Given that `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned the values of `meats[j]`, we can state that `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are replaced by `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`, respectively. The conditions mention that `c1 * T < c2 * T`, but after this assignment, `c2` will now hold the value that `c1` previously had. Therefore, this inequality does not hold anymore because `c2` now equals the previous value of `c1`. 

The other conditions (`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`) remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State reflects the updated values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` as assigned to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, while retaining the rest of the information.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x1` is the previous value of `x2`, `y1` is the previous value of `y2`, `c1` is the previous value of `c2`, `x2` is the previous value of `x1`, `y2` is the previous value of `y1`, `c2` is the previous value of `c1`; `c1 * T < previous value of c1 * T` does not hold.**
