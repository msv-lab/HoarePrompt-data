The variable `cx` is assigned the value of the average of `x1` and `x2`, where `x1` has been set to the previous value of `x2` and `x2` maintains its previous value. Thus, `cx` is calculated as `(previous value of x2 + previous value of x2) / 2`, which simplifies to `previous value of x2`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial conditions provided. Therefore, the output state after executing the code reflects this:

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` maintain their previous values; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`; `c1 * T` still does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value; `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)` where `d` remains a negative value; the loop continues to the next iteration; `cx` is equal to the previous value of `x2`.**
