Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; if `d` is less than 0, the values of `c1`, `x1`, `y1`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` are updated based on the conditions described, and `count` is still less than `K` as the loop continues to the next iteration. If `d` is not less than 0, the state remains unchanged and the loop proceeds accordingly.***
