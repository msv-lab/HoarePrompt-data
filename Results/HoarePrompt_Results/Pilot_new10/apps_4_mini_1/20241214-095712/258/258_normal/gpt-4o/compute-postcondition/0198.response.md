The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The previous values of `y1` and `y2` have not been provided, so we cannot determine a specific value for `dy`, but the formula shows that `dy` is equal to half the difference between `y1` and `y2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3; `i` is less than `N - 1; `j` is equal to `i + 3; `d` is now `d` divided by `(c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2.**
