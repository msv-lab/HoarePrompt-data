The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 2, so after executing the code, `index` will now be 5. The values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` now contains one tuple `(x, y, c)`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 5; `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.**
