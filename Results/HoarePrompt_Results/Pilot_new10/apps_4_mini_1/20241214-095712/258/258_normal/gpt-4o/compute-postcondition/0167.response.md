Output State: **`meats` and `K` remain unchanged; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `count` is less than `K`; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are unpacked from `meats[j]`.**
