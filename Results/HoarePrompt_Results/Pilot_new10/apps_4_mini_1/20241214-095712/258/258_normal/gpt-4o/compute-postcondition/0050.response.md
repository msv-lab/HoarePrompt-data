The statement `x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]` assigns the elements from the `meats` list at index `j` to the variables `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. 

Since `j` is defined as `i + 2`, it follows that:
- The assignment involves items at an index which is two positions ahead of `i` (that is, `j = i + 2`). 
- The values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will now depend on `meats[j]`, similar to the previous assignment but for a different index.

Given that `N` is greater than or equal to `j`, the constraints regarding `N`, `count`, and `j` remain applicable. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `N` is greater than or equal to `j`; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the elements of `meats` at index `j`.**
