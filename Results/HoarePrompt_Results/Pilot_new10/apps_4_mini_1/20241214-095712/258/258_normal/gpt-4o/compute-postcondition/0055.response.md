Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `N` is greater than or equal to `j`; `c1 * T < c2 * T`; and `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, which is a negative value. Since `d < 0` is true, these conditions are maintained, and `d` confirms that the inequality holds.***
