Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `N` is greater than or equal to `j`; `c1 * T < c2 * T`; `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)` which is a smaller negative value; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
