Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `K` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`; `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`; `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`; `c1 * T` still does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value; `d` remains a negative value after calculation; the loop continues to the next iteration; `cx` is equal to the previous value of `x2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is now equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dy * dy`; `d * d2` is greater than `d2`; `mx` is equal to `previous value of x2 + (dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`; `my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `count` is still less than `K`; `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`; `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`; `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`.**
