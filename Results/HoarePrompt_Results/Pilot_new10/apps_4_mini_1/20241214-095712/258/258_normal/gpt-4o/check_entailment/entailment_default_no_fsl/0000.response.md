Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to implement a solution for determining the time required for grilling K pieces of meat based on their coordinates and hardness. However, it fails to correctly handle several potential cases:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not check for invalid input values, such as any inputs violating the constraints specified in the problem description. For example, it doesn't validate whether K is less than or equal to N during runtime, though it assumes the input adheres to all the given constraints.

2. **Function Logic Flaw**: The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` in `func_1` seems to be incorrectly handling situations where the meats may not be comparable based solely on their hardness multiplied by time. It's possible that two pieces of meat could be closer or further apart in reality, and the logic for determining the midpoints does not guarantee that those produced will yield K pieces ready in the optimized time.

3. **Output Precision**: The output precision requirements specify that the solution must be accurate within \(10^{-6}\) in terms of absolute or relative error. While the implementation uses a binary search to narrow down the time, it stops at a difference of \(1e-07\), which might not guarantee that the final number aligns with the required precision in certain edge cases, especially if the meat pieces' characteristics imply close proximity in grilling time.

As a result of these issues, it is not guaranteed that the code will work correctly for all valid inputs, meaning it does not align with the requirements of the problem description effectively.
