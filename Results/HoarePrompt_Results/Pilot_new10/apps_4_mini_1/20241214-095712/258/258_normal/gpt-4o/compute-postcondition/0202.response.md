To calculate `mx`, we need to break down the expression provided in the code snippet.

Initial conditions:
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²) / 4`
- `d` may change under certain conditions which we assume remains unchanged for this operation since `d * d2 > d2` isn't provided.
- The specific value of `d` is also not provided.

Given that `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, we start with:
- `mx` being calculated based on `cx`, `dy`, `d`, and `d2`.

The output requires us to abstractly represent the computation without specific values since they are not provided in the initial state. Thus we will maintain the relationships and calculations that define `mx`.

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3; `i` is less than `N - 1; `j` is equal to `i + 3; `d` may change according to conditions provided but remains constant for this operation; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²) / 4; `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
