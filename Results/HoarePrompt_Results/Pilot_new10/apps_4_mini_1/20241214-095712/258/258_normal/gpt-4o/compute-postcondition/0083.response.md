The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` remain unchanged, and their previous values were assigned to `x1` and `x2` respectively. The calculation of `cy` will be based on the unchanged values of `y1` and `y2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats`, `K`, `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` maintain their previous values; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`; `c1 * T` still does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value; `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)` where `d` remains a negative value; the loop continues to the next iteration; `cx` is equal to the previous value of `x2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
