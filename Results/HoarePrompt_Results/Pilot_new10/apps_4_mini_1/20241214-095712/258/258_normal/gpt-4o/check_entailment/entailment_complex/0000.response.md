Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential edge cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not validate the input data format or conditions, such as ensuring that the values for \( K \) is indeed less than or equal to \( N \), which could lead to incorrect behavior with user-provided input. Additionally, while the algorithm seems to address the maximum grilling time within constraints, it could fail if the conditions on the meat coordinates or hardness are not properly met, or if there are certain unforeseen cases with the mathematics of the calculation (e.g., calculating midpoints or distances) that result in incorrect outputs due to numerical errors or floating-point inaccuracies. 

Moreover, since the annotations mention that the state of the program after executing `func_1` could potentially lead to returning false under certain conditions, this indicates that there are cases where the function might not successfully determine if at least \( K \) pieces can be grilled, leading to inaccuracies in output times.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
