The value of `my` is updated to be equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` are referenced in this calculation. Since `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and `d` is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, these values remain unchanged as per the conditions provided.

The values of `meats`, `K`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `cx`, `count`, remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`meats` and `K` remain unchanged; `N` is greater than 1; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `count` remains less than `K`; `d` is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
