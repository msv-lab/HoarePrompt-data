The code appends a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are determined based on the values from the `data` list at indices 6, 7, and 8 respectively. The state of the other variables remains unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 6 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` now contains one additional tuple `(x, y, c)` appended to its previous content; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 6; `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[7])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[8])`.**
