The code snippet assigns values to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` from the `meats` list at index `j`, which is equal to `i + 3`. Given the initial conditions, we can determine that:

- `j` is equal to `i + 3`, satisfying the precondition that `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.
- The values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will be taken from the `meats` list at that calculated index `j`.

Since `meats` remains unchanged, we will only update the affected variables `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`.

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `N` must be greater than `i + 3`; `i` is less than `N - 1; j` is equal to `i + 3; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned to the values at `meats[j]`.**
