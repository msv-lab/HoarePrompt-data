The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The initial value of `index` is 6, so after executing the code, `index` will be equal to 9. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 6 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` now contains one additional tuple `(x, y, c)` appended to its previous content; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 9; `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[7])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[8])`.**
