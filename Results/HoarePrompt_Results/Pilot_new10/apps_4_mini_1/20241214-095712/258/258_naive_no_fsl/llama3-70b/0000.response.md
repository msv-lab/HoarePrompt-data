Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the time needed to grill K pieces of meat. Specifically, the program employs a brute-force approach by iterating over a fixed range of integer values for the coordinates (X, Y) within [-1000, 1000]. This method inherently ignores potential optimal solutions located between these integer coordinates, particularly when the optimal grill placement is not at an integer point.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 3
-1 0 1
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```
In this case, the optimal position for the heat source may lie at a fractional coordinate, such as (0.5, 0.5), which would minimize the grilling time for the first three pieces of meat. However, the current implementation only evaluates integer positions, missing this potentially optimal solution entirely.

Additionally, the sorting and minimal time extraction logic could produce incorrect results if optimal placements for K pieces emerge at non-integer coordinates.

These factors demonstrate that the program does not guarantee correctness for all potential inputs, leading to the conclusion that it does not fully satisfy the problem requirements.
