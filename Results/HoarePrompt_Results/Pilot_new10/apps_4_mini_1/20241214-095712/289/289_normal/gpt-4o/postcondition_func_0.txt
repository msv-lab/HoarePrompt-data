The function reads a positive integer `n` from the input, calculates the maximum number of games that can be played in a tournament with `n` players using the formula `n.bit_length() - 1`, and prints that value. The function does not accept any parameters and its operation depends entirely on the value of `n`, which must be between 2 and 10^18.
