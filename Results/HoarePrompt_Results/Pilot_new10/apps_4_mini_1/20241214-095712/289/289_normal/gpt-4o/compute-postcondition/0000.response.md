The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is initially defined as a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the output state will also reflect the updated value of `n` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament; `n` is the input integer.**
