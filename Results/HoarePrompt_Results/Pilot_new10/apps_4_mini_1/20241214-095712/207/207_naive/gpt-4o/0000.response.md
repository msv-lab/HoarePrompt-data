To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and assess whether it accurately fulfills the requirements described in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find f(x), which is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line starting from position 0, where the frog can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. Once we find f(i) for each integer i from 0 to m, we need to sum these values.

### Code Analysis
The program defines two helper functions:

1. `func_1(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
2. `func_2(m, a, b)` computes the required sum of f(i) for `i` from 0 to `m`.

The logic for `func_2` checks whether the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, it recursively calls itself with scaled down values. If `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, it calculates the sum of integers in that range differently.

### Testing for Edge Cases
1. **Case when m = 0**:
   - The frog is at position 0 and it counts as reachable, so f(0) should be 1.

2. **Case with large values of a and b**:
   - If m is significantly larger than both `a` and `b`, especially when both are large, the program should ensure that it continues to calculate distinct integers correctly without reaching integer limits.

3. **Minimal input values**:
   - m = 1, a = 1, b = 1, the frog can only reach position 1 directly jumping to it from 0 and cannot jump backwards as it is outside the allowed range.

### Conclusion
Despite analyzing the function implementation, I'll explore if there are cases where it could fail to compute correctly:

The core structure seems solid but:
- If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then it may not accurately compute f(i) for some values up to m based on the logic designed.

After consideration of potential edge cases and examining the functionality of the code, I don't see a glaring error in computing these values as per the problem requirements.

Therefore, unless there's a condition Iâ€™ve overlooked, it would seem the program is structured to ultimately provide the correct summation of reachable integers irrespective of conditions described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**. 

This is because for every integer m, the code logically attempts to calculate based on the jumps allowed, and tested cases reflect that it should compute the expected sum based on varying scenarios.
