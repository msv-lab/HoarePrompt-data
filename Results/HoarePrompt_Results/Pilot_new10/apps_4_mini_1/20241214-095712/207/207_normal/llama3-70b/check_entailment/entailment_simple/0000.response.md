The provided program attempts to solve the problem by creating a dynamic programming array `dp` to count the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within a given interval `[0, m]`. However, upon examining the logic of how the array is updated, it does not correctly follow the requirements set forth in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Logical Setup**: 
   - The program initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` is meant to hold the number of ways to reach the position `i` based on the defined jumps.
   - It correctly sets `dp[0] = 1` since the frog starts at position 0.

2. **Updating Logic**:
   - The program increments `dp[i + a]` by `dp[i]` when making a forward jump (`k + a`), which is correct.
   - However, it also mistakenly increments `dp[i]` by `dp[i - b]` when making a backward jump (`k - b`). This accumulation logic is flawed, particularly because it allows the counting of distinct ways to reach `i` rather than the distinct integers that can be reached from `0` to `m`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The program sums up all values in the `dp` array to compute the final answer. The problem asks for the sum of distinct reachable integers rather than the count of ways to reach each position.

### Key Issues
- The output is generated based on counting the number of ways to reach each index, rather than keeping track of whether each index is reachable or not.
- The backward jump logic can incorrectly influence the reachable count for positions, thus failing to meet the constraints in the description.

### Conclusion
Because of these fundamental flaws in the jump logic and the counting mechanism, the provided program does not adhere to the problem requirements. Therefore, it does not correctly calculate the sum of reachable integers as described.

Correctness: **False**
