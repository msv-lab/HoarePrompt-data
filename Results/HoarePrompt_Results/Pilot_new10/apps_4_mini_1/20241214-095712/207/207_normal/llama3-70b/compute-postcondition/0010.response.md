According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` from 0 to `m`, and whether it can execute again depends on the current value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was last set to a value that would have been less than or equal to `m`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 from its previous value. 

Given that `i` is currently at its last used value, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`. Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as there are no modifications to those variables in the context provided.

State: **`m`, `a`, `b` are positive integers, `i` is the value of the last iteration incremented by 1**
