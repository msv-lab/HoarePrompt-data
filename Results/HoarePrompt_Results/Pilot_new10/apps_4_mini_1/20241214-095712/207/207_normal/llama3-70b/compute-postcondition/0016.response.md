The line of code updates the value of `dp[i + a]` by adding the current value of `dp[i]` to it. Given that `i` is `m + 1`, we can infer the index `i + a` as `m + 1 + a`. The initial state includes that `m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, and we do not have specific values for `dp` at this point. Since `i` is directly related to `m`, it is updated adjacent to the size of `m`.

The overall statement is that the specific index `i + a` in the array `dp` is updated based on the current value of `dp[i]`. This means that the `dp` value at `i + a` will now reflect whatever addition might occur from the `dp` value at `i`.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers; `i` is `m + 1`; `dp[i + a]` is updated to `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.**
