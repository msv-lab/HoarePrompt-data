Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b` through user input and calculates the total number of ways to reach the index `m` using steps of size `a` (forward) and `b` (backward). It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each index from 0 to `m`. Ultimately, it prints the sum of all ways to reach each index, including those that might not be reachable with the specified `a` and `b`. If `m` is too large or `a` and `b` are outside the defined ranges, the function may not behave correctly, but this is dependent on the input constraints.**
