The code snippet `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` increments `dp[i]` by the value of `dp[i - b]`. Given the initial state, we have `dp[a]` set to 1 (if `i + a <= m`) and all other values of `dp` initialized to 0. Since `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i - b]` will yield a value based on the previously defined `dp` array.

The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after this operation. If `i` is sufficiently large such that `i - b` is within the range of the `dp` array, it will look up the value of `dp[i - b]`, which could be either 0 or 1 depending on the initial condition placed on `dp`.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `i`, `a`, `b`, or even the specific value of `dp[i - b]` (and hence also `dp[i]`), the new state remains ambiguous but follows the original constraints.

Given the impact:
- `dp[i]` now reflects its previous value incremented by `dp[i - b]`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `dp[i]` is updated, `dp[i]` is now equal to its previous value plus `dp[i - b]`.**
