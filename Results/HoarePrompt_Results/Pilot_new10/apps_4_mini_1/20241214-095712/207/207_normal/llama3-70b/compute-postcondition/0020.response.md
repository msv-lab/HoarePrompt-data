Output State: **`m`, `a`, `b` are positive integers. `dp` is an array where `dp[i]` contains the number of ways to reach the index `i` using steps of size `a` and `b`, such that `dp[0]` is 1 and all other values depend on the accumulated values from previous iterations. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + a]` is incremented by `dp[i]`, and if `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i]` is incremented by `dp[i - b]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `dp` reflects all possible combinations of moves to reach each index up to `m`.**
