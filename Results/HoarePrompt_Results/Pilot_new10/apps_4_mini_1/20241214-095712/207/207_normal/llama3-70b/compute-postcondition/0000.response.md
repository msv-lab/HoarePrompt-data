In this code snippet, the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are assigned new values based on user input. The previous constraints on these variables still hold, but now their specific values are determined by the input taken.

Since `m` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\) and both `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), the output state will reflect that `m`, `a`, and `b` will now hold specific integers provided by the user input. However, since we donâ€™t have the actual input values, we will leave them as unspecified integers within their valid ranges.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer specified by input, such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer specified by input, such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer specified by input, such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5.**
