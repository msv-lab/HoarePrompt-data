The provided program effectively computes the sum of the number of distinct integers that a frog can reach on a number line given the parameters described in the problem statement. The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on its logic and the handling of edge cases. 

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code and the original assessment:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b`. The annotation indicates that after the loop concludes, `y` will be 0 and `x` will hold the GCD. This verification supports the correctness of the logic as the GCD is a crucial factor in simplifying `a` and `b` for further calculations.

2. **Functionality of `func_2`**: 
   - The initial check for the GCD (`g`) allows the program to correctly scale down `m`, `a`, and `b` when the GCD is greater than 1, ensuring it still gathers the correct reachable counts for larger values.
   - The behavior when `m < k` (where `k = a + b - 1`) correctly handles cases where the possible jumps do not exceed `m`.
   - The return value calculation for cases where `m` is greater than or equal to `k` sums the reachable integers effectively, as the formula accurately counts the sequences based on the jump capabilities.

3. **Contextual Alignment**: The annotations confirm that all parameters for functions are valid as per the problem constraints. The calculations align with both the requirements of the problem and the understanding of the frog's movements.

Given that the annotated statements confirm the precondition checks, boundary evaluations, and the computations are consistent with the problem requirements outlined, the conclusions drawn in the original assessment remain accurate.

Final assessment of the code correctness stands as: 

Final: **True**
