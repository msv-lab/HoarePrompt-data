You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and assess whether it accurately fulfills the requirements described in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find f(x), which is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line starting from position 0, where the frog can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. Once we find f(i) for each integer i from 0 to m, we need to sum these values.

### Code Analysis
The program defines two helper functions:

1. `func_1(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
2. `func_2(m, a, b)` computes the required sum of f(i) for `i` from 0 to `m`.

The logic for `func_2` checks whether the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, it recursively calls itself with scaled down values. If `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, it calculates the sum of integers in that range differently.

### Testing for Edge Cases
1. **Case when m = 0**:
   - The frog is at position 0 and it counts as reachable, so f(0) should be 1.

2. **Case with large values of a and b**:
   - If m is significantly larger than both `a` and `b`, especially when both are large, the program should ensure that it continues to calculate distinct integers correctly without reaching integer limits.

3. **Minimal input values**:
   - m = 1, a = 1, b = 1, the frog can only reach position 1 directly jumping to it from 0 and cannot jump backwards as it is outside the allowed range.

### Conclusion
Despite analyzing the function implementation, I'll explore if there are cases where it could fail to compute correctly:

The core structure seems solid but:
- If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then it may not accurately compute f(i) for some values up to m based on the logic designed.

After consideration of potential edge cases and examining the functionality of the code, I don't see a glaring error in computing these values as per the problem requirements.

Therefore, unless there's a condition Iâ€™ve overlooked, it would seem the program is structured to ultimately provide the correct summation of reachable integers irrespective of conditions described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**. 

This is because for every integer m, the code logically attempts to calculate based on the jumps allowed, and tested cases reflect that it should compute the expected sum based on varying scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0 at the start, the function will directly return `x` as the GCD, since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts three parameters: positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b`. It first calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to obtain `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with modified parameters `(m // g, a // g, b // g)`, multiplying the result by `g`. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` integers. If neither of these conditions hold, it calculates and returns the sum of two series: one up to `k` and another from `k` to `m`. The function can therefore handle different scenarios based on the values of `g`, `m`, `a`, and `b` while involving multiple recursive calls if `g` is greater than 1. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
