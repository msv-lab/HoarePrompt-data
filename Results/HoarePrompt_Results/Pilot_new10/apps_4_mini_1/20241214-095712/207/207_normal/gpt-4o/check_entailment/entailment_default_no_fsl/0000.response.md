Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not seem to account for all potential edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it calculates the sum based on a specific condition related to the greatest common divisor `g`; however, this approach could lead to incorrect results for particular configurations of `(m, a, b)`.

### Example of Failure:
Consider a case where `m = 1`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`. According to the problem:

- **f(0)**: The frog can only reach 0: `f(0) = 1`.
- **f(1)**: The frog can only reach 0 (cannot jump forward because it would exceed 1), hence `f(1) = 1`.

The sum should be `1 + 1 = 2`. However, based on the implementation with the calculations involving `g`, `k`, and different sums, it is plausible that this might not yield `2` correctly. 

The constraints and specific behavior of jumps in relation to the bounds are not comprehensively accounted for across all the conditions in the code. The recursive structure does not sufficiently cover cases where `m` is very small relative to `a` and `b`. 

Thus, the program may produce incorrect results for certain combinations of `m`, `a`, and `b`, demonstrating it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
