To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the functionality required to compute the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`, given the frog's jumping rules based on parameters `a` and `b`.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The frog can jump from position `k` to either `k+a` or `k-b`.
2. `f(x)` counts how many distinct integers the frog can reach in the range `[0, x]`.
3. The task is to compute the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. This is a necessary step because if `g = gcd(a, b)`, then the frog's reach can be scaled down by `g` since the frog can reach positions that are multiples of `g`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: 
   - When `g != 1`, the program scales down `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g` and recursively computes `func_2`. This seems to align with simplifying problem constraints, as it effectively reduces large inputs by their common factors.
   - Next, if `m < k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), it computes a closed-form arithmetic sum for `f(i)` when the range of reachable integers is small due to the limits imposed by `a` and `b`.
   - Finally, when `m >= k`, it calculates `sum_k`, the sum of numbers up to `k`, and adjusts for the portions of the reached numbers up to `m` including any adjustments to avoid over-counting those that fall out of bounds set by `k`.

### Correctness Checks:
- The method correctly identifies when to utilize a direct arithmetic approach versus a more complex model when the inputs are larger.
- The calculations made in `func_2` appear to correctly compute the result based on how far the frog can jump and the constraint imposed by the limit `m`.

### Conclusion:
The algorithm logically computes the distinct integers that can be reached by the frog up to `m` and sums these values correctly, as described in the problem. The cases defined ensure all bounds and conditions are managed appropriately.

Thus, the provided program meets the problem description perfectly.

Correctness: **True**
