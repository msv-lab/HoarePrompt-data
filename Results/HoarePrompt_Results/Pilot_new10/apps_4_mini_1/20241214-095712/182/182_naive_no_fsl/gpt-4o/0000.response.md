To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic for determining the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations required to achieve minimal deviation from vertical for a given camera angle.

### Key Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. The input is a single integer `x`, representing the camera rotation angle in degrees.
2. Positive angles represent clockwise rotation, while negative angles represent counter-clockwise rotation.
3. The output should be the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required.
4. Rotations can be calculated using the normalized angle modulo 360.

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the code logic:

1. `normalized_angle = x % 360`: This line normalizes the input angle to a value between 0 and 359 degrees.
2. `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`: This calculation determines how many 90-degree clockwise turns are required to correct the camera's orientation:
   - `360 - normalized_angle` gives the immediate angle that needs to be counteracted to achieve vertical alignment.
   - Dividing by 90 converts the angle into the number of 90-degree turns.
   - The modulo 4 ensures that any angles that exceed a full rotation (360 degrees) cycle through the possible turn counts [0, 1, 2, 3].

### Testing with Edge Cases:
Now we will test the function with various angle inputs:

1. **Input: `60`** (expected output: `1`)
   - `normalized_angle = 60 % 360` is `60`
   - `turns = (360 - 60) // 90 % 4` gives `3` turns, the expected output is indeed `1`.
   
2. **Input: `-60`** (expected output: `3`)
   - `normalized_angle = -60 % 360` is `300`
   - `turns = (360 - 300) // 90 % 4` gives `0` turns, but the expected output is `3`. Here the logic fails.

3. **Input: `360`** (expected output: `0`)
   - `normalized_angle = 360 % 360` is `0`
   - `turns = (360 - 0) // 90 % 4` gives `0` turns, which is correct.

4. **Input: `450`** (expected output: `1`)
   - `normalized_angle = 450 % 360` is `90`
   - `turns = (360 - 90) // 90 % 4` gives `3` turns, expected to output `1`.

### Conclusion:
From the above testing, we can see that the function produces incorrect outputs for certain inputs where the angle results in counter-clockwise rotations. Specifically, when inputs like `-60` or `450` are tested, the results do not align with expected behavior.

Thus, the function does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
