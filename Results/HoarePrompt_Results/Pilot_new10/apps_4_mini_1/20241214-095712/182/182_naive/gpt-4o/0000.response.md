Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle cases where the angle provided is not a multiple of 90 degrees. Specifically, it should return the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. However, it uses the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, which gives incorrect results when `normalized_angle` is already less than or equal to 0 but not a multiple of 90.

For example:

- If the input is `-60`, the normalized angle will be `300` (since `-60 % 360 = 300`). Calculating the necessary turns as `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4` will give `(60) // 90 % 4`, which is `0`. The expected output for a `-60` degree counter-clockwise rotation is `3` turns, but the program incorrectly returns `0`.

This demonstrates that the program does not produce the correct output for all potential inputs as specified in the problem description.
