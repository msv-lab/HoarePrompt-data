The function `func` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, constrained by the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. Since no specific output cases or transformations are provided in the output section, the general return value and behavior of the function are not clearly defined based on the information given. Therefore, the functionality of the function is simply to accept an integer parameter representing a camera rotation angle.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, constrained by -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.**
