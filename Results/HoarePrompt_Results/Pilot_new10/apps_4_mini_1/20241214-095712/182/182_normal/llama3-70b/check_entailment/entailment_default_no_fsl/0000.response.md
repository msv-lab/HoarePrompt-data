Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to properly compute the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical.

For example, consider the input of `-60`. The correct output should be `3`, as stated in the problem description, because three 90-degree turns will result in the minimum deviation of 30 degrees. However, the provided code will normalize `-60` to `300` (using `x % 360`), and then it will output `3` derived from `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which incorrectly relies on division without considering the context of how many turns are needed to reach the minimal deviation. 

Additionally, the output hints do not correctly reflect the functionality needed to solve the problem, suggesting that the program may not be fully implemented to handle the conditions necessary to meet all edge cases specified. 

Thus, the program does not conform to the requirements in every potential case, leading to the conclusion that its correctness is False.
