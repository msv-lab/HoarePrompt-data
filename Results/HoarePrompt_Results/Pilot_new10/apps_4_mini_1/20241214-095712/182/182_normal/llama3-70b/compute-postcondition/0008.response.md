Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `x`, which represents a camera rotation angle in degrees. It normalizes `x` to a value between 0 and 359 by applying `x % 360`. If the normalized value is 0, it prints 0. For other values, it calculates and prints a number that indicates the quadrant the angle falls into, with results of 1, 2, or 3 corresponding to ranges of angles between 1 to 90, 91 to 180, and 181 to 270 degrees, respectively. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. **
