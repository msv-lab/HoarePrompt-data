Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotated code. The program correctly handles both positive and negative angles by normalizing the input and calculating the required 90-degree clockwise rotations needed to minimize deviation from vertical. The annotations support this by confirming the correct normalization of `x` and the subsequent calculations are valid for determining the number of turns. The program handles edge cases appropriately, and the logic aligns with the requirements laid out in the problem description.
