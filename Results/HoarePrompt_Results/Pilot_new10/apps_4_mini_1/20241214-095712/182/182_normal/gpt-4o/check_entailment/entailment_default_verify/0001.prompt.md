You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.

One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?

But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.

Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.

Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to "true up". [Image] 

The next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.


-----Examples-----
Input
60

Output
1

Input
-60

Output
3



-----Note-----

When the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.

From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic for determining the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations required to achieve minimal deviation from vertical for a given camera angle.

### Key Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. The input is a single integer `x`, representing the camera rotation angle in degrees.
2. Positive angles represent clockwise rotation, while negative angles represent counter-clockwise rotation.
3. The output should be the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required.
4. Rotations can be calculated using the normalized angle modulo 360.

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the code logic:

1. `normalized_angle = x % 360`: This line normalizes the input angle to a value between 0 and 359 degrees.
2. `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`: This calculation determines how many 90-degree clockwise turns are required to correct the camera's orientation:
   - `360 - normalized_angle` gives the immediate angle that needs to be counteracted to achieve vertical alignment.
   - Dividing by 90 converts the angle into the number of 90-degree turns.
   - The modulo 4 ensures that any angles that exceed a full rotation (360 degrees) cycle through the possible turn counts [0, 1, 2, 3].

### Testing with Edge Cases:
Now we will test the function with various angle inputs:

1. **Input: `60`** (expected output: `1`)
   - `normalized_angle = 60 % 360` is `60`
   - `turns = (360 - 60) // 90 % 4` gives `3` turns, the expected output is indeed `1`.
   
2. **Input: `-60`** (expected output: `3`)
   - `normalized_angle = -60 % 360` is `300`
   - `turns = (360 - 300) // 90 % 4` gives `0` turns, but the expected output is `3`. Here the logic fails.

3. **Input: `360`** (expected output: `0`)
   - `normalized_angle = 360 % 360` is `0`
   - `turns = (360 - 0) // 90 % 4` gives `0` turns, which is correct.

4. **Input: `450`** (expected output: `1`)
   - `normalized_angle = 450 % 360` is `90`
   - `turns = (360 - 90) // 90 % 4` gives `3` turns, expected to output `1`.

### Conclusion:
From the above testing, we can see that the function produces incorrect outputs for certain inputs where the angle results in counter-clockwise rotations. Specifically, when inputs like `-60` or `450` are tested, the results do not align with expected behavior.

Thus, the function does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer input representing a camera rotation angle in degrees, normalizes this angle by taking its modulo with 360, and calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to return to the original position, which it then prints. The function does not return a value. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
