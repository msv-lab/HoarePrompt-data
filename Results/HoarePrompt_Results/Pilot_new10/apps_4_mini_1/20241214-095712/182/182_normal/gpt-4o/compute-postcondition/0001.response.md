The code assigns the value of `normalized_angle` to be the remainder of `x` when divided by 360, effectively normalizing the camera rotation angle to a range of 0 to 359 degrees. The previous value of `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees set to an input integer value; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`.**
