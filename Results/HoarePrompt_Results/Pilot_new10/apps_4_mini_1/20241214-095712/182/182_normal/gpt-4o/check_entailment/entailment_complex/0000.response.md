To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

The program's objective is to calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to make an image taken by a rotated camera appear minimally deviated from vertical. The exact requirements are as follows:

1. **Input and Normalization**: 
   - The function takes an integer input representing the camera's rotation angle in degrees, which can range from -10^18 to 10^18.
   - It normalizes this angle using `x % 360`, ensuring that calculations remain manageable within a 360-degree circle.

2. **Calculation of Turns**:
   - The number of 90-degree clockwise turns is calculated using the formula: 
     ```python
     turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
     ```
     Here, `normalized_angle` refers to the angle after normalization. This calculation effectively determines how many 90-degree clockwise turns are necessary to correct the rotation.
   - The formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90` computes the number of 90-degree turns needed to achieve a rotation that aligns closest to vertical. The `mod 4` is applied to ensure the result is within the range [0, 3].

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the calculated number of turns.

Now, let's analyze potential cases based on the problem description:

- For **positive angles**: These are interpreted as a clockwise rotation of the camera, meaning we would need to counteract this by performing clockwise turns.
- For **negative angles**: These are interpreted as counter-clockwise rotations, where the calculations must effectively convert this to the corresponding clockwise turns needed to return to the least rotated position from vertical.

Let's validate the provided examples in the problem description with the program logic:

1. **Input: 60**
   - Normalized angle is `60 % 360 = 60`
   - Turns calculation: `(360 - 60) // 90 % 4 = (300 // 90) % 4 = 3 % 4 = 3`
   - However, the expected result is `1`, indicating a flaw as it does not return the correct result.

2. **Input: -60**
   - Normalized angle is `-60 % 360 = 300`
   - Turns calculation: `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = (60 // 90) % 4 = 0`
   - The expected output is `3`, which confirms another flaw as it does not provide the correct output.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to achieve the desired image orientation based on the problem description across all potential inputs. 

Therefore, based on the above observations:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to account for the required calculations, meaning it does not conform to the problem specification, leading to inaccurate outcomes for certain inputs.
