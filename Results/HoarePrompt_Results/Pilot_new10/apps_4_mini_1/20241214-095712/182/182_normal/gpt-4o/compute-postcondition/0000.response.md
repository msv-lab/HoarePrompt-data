The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input from the user and `int` converts this input to an integer. The previous value of `x` is overwritten by this new integer input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the change to `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees set to an input integer value**.
