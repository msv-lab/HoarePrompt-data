The function `func` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, constrained between -10^18 and 10^18. The output behavior of the function has not been specified in the provided details. Therefore, I cannot determine the return value based on the output relationships provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `x`, representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, within the range of -10^18 to 10^18. The return value is not specified.**
