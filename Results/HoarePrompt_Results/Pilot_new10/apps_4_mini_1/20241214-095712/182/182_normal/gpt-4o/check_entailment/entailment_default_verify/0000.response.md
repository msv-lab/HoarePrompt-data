Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails when the normalized angle (result of `x % 360`) is negative or when the angle is not a multiple of 90 degrees, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. For instance, for an input of `-60`, the program incorrectly returns `0` turns instead of the expected `3` turns. This clearly demonstrates that the program cannot provide the correct minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns for all possible input angles, thus making it incorrect according to the specifications given.
