Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True; `ind` remains -1 or 1 depending on `s[1]`; `i` is 2. If the character `s[i]` is `[`, the state related to that condition is satisfied. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is not `[`, `ind` is updated to 2, and the overall state remains consistent with `f` being True and `i` still being 2, while allowing for the possibility to break out of a loop when `s[i]` is `:`.***
