The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is 1; `f` is True in both cases; `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
