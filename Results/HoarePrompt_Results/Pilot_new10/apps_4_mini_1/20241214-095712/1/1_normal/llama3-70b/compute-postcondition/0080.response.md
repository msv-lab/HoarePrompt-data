Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | (length between 1 and 500,000). It searches for the first occurrence of ':' after the first '[' and the first occurrence of ':' before the last ']', returning -1 if either ':' is not found, or if the first ':' occurs at or after the last ':' in the defined substring. If both ':' characters are found appropriately, it counts the number of '|' characters between these indices, adds 4 to this count, and prints the result. If there are no '|' characters in this range, it prints 4.**
