You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                ind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' following the first '[' in `s` or remains -1 if ':' was not found after any '['; `f` is True if at least one '[' was encountered in `s`, otherwise False; `i` is `n`, indicating the end of the string traversal.
    bind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                bind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' following the first '[' in `s` or remains -1 if ':' was not found after any '['; `f` is True if at least one ']' was found in the string; `bind` is the index of the first ':' found after the last ']' if such ':' exists and `-1` otherwise.
    if (ind == -1 or bind == -1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        if (ind >= bind) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            ans = 4
            for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    ans += 1
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' following the first '[', `f` is True if at least one ']' was found in the string, `bind` is the index of the first ':' found after the last ']', `ans` is equal to 4 plus the number of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]` if the loop executes; if the loop does not execute, `ans` remains 4.
            print(ans)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' following the first '[' in `s` and is not -1; `f` is True if at least one ']' was found in the string; `bind` is the index of the first ':' found after the last ']' and is not -1 if such ':' exists. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the printed value is -1. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to 4 plus the number of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]` if the loop executes, and remains 4 if the loop does not execute; the value of `ans` has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; if either `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, it indicates that no ':' was found after the first '[' or no ':' was found after the last ']', and thus the relevant conditions for `f` and `bind` hold. If `ind` is not -1, and `bind` is not -1, it indicates that both ':' occurrences exist, and if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the printed value is -1; otherwise, `ans` is calculated as 4 plus the number of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]`, or remains 4 if the loop does not execute, with the final value of `ans` printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
