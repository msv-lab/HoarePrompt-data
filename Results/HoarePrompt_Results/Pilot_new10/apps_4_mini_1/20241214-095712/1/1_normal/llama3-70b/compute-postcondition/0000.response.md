The value of `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which represents a string that the user will enter. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, and `s` is an input string.**
