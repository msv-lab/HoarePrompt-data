The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `bind` is greater than or equal to `ind`, `i` is `ind - 1`, `end_colon` is `ind - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
