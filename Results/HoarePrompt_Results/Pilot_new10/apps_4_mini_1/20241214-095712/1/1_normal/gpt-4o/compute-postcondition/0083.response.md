Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `i` is the last index checked, which will be -1 if the loop does not execute. If `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1, and `i` is -1, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, if `start_colon` or `end_colon` is -1, or if `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, then -1 has been printed. If `start_colon` is valid and less than `end_colon`, `pipe_count` is the count of '|' characters found in the substring between `start_colon` and `end_colon` (exclusive), `result` is equal to `4 + pipe_count`, and the value of `result` has been printed.***
