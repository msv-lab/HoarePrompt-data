The value of `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is `bind - 2` where `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s'` which is greater than `ind + 1`, the state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s'` which is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 2`, and `end_colon` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s'` which is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `end_colon` is equal to `i`.**
