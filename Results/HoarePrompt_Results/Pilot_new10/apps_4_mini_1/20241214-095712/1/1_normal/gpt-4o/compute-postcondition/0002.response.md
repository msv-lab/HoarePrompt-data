The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `-1`. The other variables maintain their existing states, specifically `s` as a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], : and |, with a length of `n` between 1 and 500,000. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `ind` while preserving the conditions about `s` and `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], : and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is -1**.
