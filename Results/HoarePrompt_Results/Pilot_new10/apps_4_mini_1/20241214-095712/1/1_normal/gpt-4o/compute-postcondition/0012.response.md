According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length `n` of the string `s`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either smaller than `n` or it has reached `n`, indicating the possibility of the loop terminating.

Since `s` is a string of length `n` (which is greater than 0), and `ind` is used for controlling the flow but does not affect the index `i` directly, we focus on adjusting `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration (where `x < n`), we will have `i` as `x + 1` for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must remain the same, and `i` should be equal to `x + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters with length `n` greater than 0, i is x + 1, n is still greater than x + 1**
