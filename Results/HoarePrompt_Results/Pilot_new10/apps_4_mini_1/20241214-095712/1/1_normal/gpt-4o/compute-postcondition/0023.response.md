According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be decremented by 1. 

Since `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s` and `n` must be greater than 0, we also ensure that `n` remains greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, if the character at index `i` in `s` is ']', we break out of the most internal loop, and we need to adjust `i` to `n - 2` for the next iteration, while keeping the other states consistent.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` must be greater than 1, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 2`**
