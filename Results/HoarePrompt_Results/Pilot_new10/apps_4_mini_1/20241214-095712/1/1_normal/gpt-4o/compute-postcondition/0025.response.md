The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` must be greater than 1, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is equal to `n - 2`, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
