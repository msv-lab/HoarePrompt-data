According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `bind`. The loop starts with `i` set to `ind + 1` and will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `bind`. Currently, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, and `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s', which is greater than `ind + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still equal to `ind + 1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to `ind + 2`. In addition, for the loop to continue executing, `ind + 2` must be less than `bind`.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is: `i` is now `ind + 2`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s' which is greater than `ind + 2`, and `i` is `ind + 2`**
