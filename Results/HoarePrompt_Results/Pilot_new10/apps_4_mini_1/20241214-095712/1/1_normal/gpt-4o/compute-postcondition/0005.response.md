In this code snippet, `ind` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is currently `0`, `ind` will also now be `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is the length of `s` which is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ind` is 0**.
