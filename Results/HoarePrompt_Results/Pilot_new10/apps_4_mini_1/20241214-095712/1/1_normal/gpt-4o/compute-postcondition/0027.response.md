According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1, making it equal to `n - 3`. The loop must keep iterating while `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. 

The current state shows that `n` is greater than 1, which allows `i` to have a valid value, and since `ind` refers to the index of the first occurrence of '[' it is not relevant for the upcoming iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to `n - 3`.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than 1, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is equal to `n - 2`, `i` is equal to `n - 3`**
