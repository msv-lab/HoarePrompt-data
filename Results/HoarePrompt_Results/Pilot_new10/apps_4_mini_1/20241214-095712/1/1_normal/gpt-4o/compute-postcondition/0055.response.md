Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s' which is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 1`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` and before `bind`, which must exist. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', then `end_colon` is set to `bind - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
