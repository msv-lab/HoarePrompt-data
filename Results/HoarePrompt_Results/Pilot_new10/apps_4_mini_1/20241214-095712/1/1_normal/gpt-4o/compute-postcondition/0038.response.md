The value of `start_colon` is updated to the value of `i`. Since `i` is the index of the first character after the '[' in `s`, `start_colon` now holds that specific index. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s` which is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `ind + 1`, `start_colon` is equal to `i`.**
