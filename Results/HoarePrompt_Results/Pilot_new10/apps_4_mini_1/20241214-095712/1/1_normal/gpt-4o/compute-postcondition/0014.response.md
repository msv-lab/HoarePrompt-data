The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters with length `n` greater than 0, `i` is `x + 1`, `n` is still greater than `x + 1`, `ind` is `x + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
