The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s` which is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 1`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` and before `bind`, which must exist, `end_colon` is `bind - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
