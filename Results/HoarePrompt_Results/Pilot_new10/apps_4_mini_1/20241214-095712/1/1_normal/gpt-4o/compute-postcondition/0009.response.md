The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `ind` will reflect this assignment. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State reflects the new value of `ind` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is the length of `s` which is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1**
