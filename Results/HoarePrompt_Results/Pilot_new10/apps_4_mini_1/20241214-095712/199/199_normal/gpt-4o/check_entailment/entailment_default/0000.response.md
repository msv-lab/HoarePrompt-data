The program does not correctly adhere to the problem description for every potential case. 

Let's analyze the logic in `func_1(n)`:

1. It first checks if `n` is less than 6 and returns 0 in that case, which is correct as it's impossible to cut the stick into four parts.
2. For `n` greater than or equal to 6, it tries to find pairs of parts `(a, b)` such that `a = b` and their combined lengths plus a valid remainder form the total length of the stick `n`.

However, the calculation of `rem` considers `n - 2 * (a + b)`, where `b` is set equal to `a`. 

The issue lies in this logic:
- It assumes that `rem` needs to be positive and even and also checks that `a != rem // 2`. However, this does not adequately ensure that you end up with four distinct positive integer lengths that can form a rectangle without being a square.
  
For example, in case of `n = 10`, the configurations should be:
- `{1, 1, 4, 4}`
- `{2, 2, 3, 3}`

But the check for `rem % 2 == 0` and `a != rem // 2` will not correctly handle all valid combinations and could potentially miss or incorrectly include certain configurations. 

Moreover, the loop that ranges `a` from `1` to `n // 4` may not sufficiently cover cases to find all valid configurations where `a` and `b` can vary independently.

Therefore:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program will not yield correct results in all cases, particularly in cases like `n = 10`, where it would incorrectly assess the available partition lengths.
