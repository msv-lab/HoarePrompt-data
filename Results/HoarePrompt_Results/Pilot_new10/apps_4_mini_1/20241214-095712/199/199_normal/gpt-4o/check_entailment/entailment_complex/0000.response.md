To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to carefully assess whether it accurately counts the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that it can form a rectangle but not a square. 

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The goal is to split a stick into four positive integer lengths.
2. These lengths must be able to form a rectangle, which requires that we have two pairs of equal lengths.
3. These lengths must not be the same (to avoid forming a square).
4. The minimum length for which this is possible is `6`, since at least two pairs of positive integers (e.g., {1,1,2,2}) are needed.

### Function Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(n)` checks if `n` is less than `6`. If `n < 6`, the function returns `0`, which is correct because it's impossible to form valid configurations.
  
   ```python
   if (n < 6) :
       return 0
   ```

2. If `n >= 6`, a loop iterates `a` from `1` to `n // 4`. In the loop:
   - `b` is assigned the value of `a`.
   - The remainder `rem` is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`, which simplifies to `n - 4 * a`.
   - The code checks if `rem` is positive and even (valid for forming pairs).
   - It also ensures that `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`.

   ```python
   for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
       b = a
       rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
       if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
           if a != rem // 2:
               count += 1
   ```

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The loop correctly generates pairs \((a, a)\) and accounts for the remaining length to form the required rectangle. 
- The conditions ensure that two pairs can be formed and that these pairs are not equal (thus avoiding squares).
- The counting of valid configurations appears to be correct based on the mathematical derivation of the pairs.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 6`: The only valid configuration is \{1, 1, 2, 2} resulting in 1 way.
- For `n = 20`: The valid configurations are \{1, 1, 9, 9\}, \{2, 2, 8, 8\}, \{3, 3, 7, 7\}, \{4, 4, 6, 6\}, totaling 4 ways.

### Conclusion:
Based on this exhaustive examination, the program accurately adheres to the specifications of the problem description. It correctly counts the number of distinct ways to form pairs such that the criteria for rectangles (not squares) are met.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
