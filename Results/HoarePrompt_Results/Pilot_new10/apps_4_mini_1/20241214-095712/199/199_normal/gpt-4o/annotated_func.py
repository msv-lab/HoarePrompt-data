#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.

    if (n < 6) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as specified in the return statement
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, and `n` is greater than or equal to 6.

    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is the number of valid configurations, `a` is at most `n // 4`, `b` is equal to `a`, `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * (n // 4)` (which is either 0 or negative), and `rem` is even.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of valid configurations, represented by the variable 'count'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) and returns 0 if `n` is less than 6. If `n` is 6 or greater, it calculates and returns the number of valid configurations based on pairs (a, b) and a remainder (rem) derived from `n`. Specifically, the function counts configurations where `rem` is positive and even, and a is not equal to half of `rem`. The function's functionality accounts for edge cases when `n` is less than 6 and only computes valid configurations for larger values of `n`.
