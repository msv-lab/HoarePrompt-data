Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is set to 1; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; `rem` is equal to `n - 4`, where `rem` is greater than 0 and `rem` is an even number. If the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2, then count is updated to 1.***
