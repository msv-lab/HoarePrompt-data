To determine the output state after the execution of the provided code, we start by analyzing the initial state and the impact of the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 8.
- `count` is set to 1.
- `a` is 2.
- `b` is 2.
- `rem` is equal to `n - 4` and is greater than 0 and even.

Now we evaluate the code snippet:
```
rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
```

In this snippet:
- The expression `a + b` evaluates to `2 + 2`, which equals `4`.
- Therefore, `2 * (a + b)` evaluates to `2 * 4`, which equals `8`.
- Consequently, the new value of `rem` is computed as:  
  `rem = n - 8`.

This means:
- The new value of `rem` is `n - 8`.

We must also confirm the validity of the conditions regarding `rem`:
1. Since `n` is at least 8, `rem` is equal to `n - 8`, which means `rem` is non-negative.
2. `rem` must still be greater than 0. For this to hold, `n` must be greater than 8, which is consistent with the initial condition.
3. `rem` remains even, as `n - 8` retains the parity of `n` provided `n` is even (since 8 is even).

Now we summarize the updated values while retaining the relevant initial conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 8. (This holds as we didn't change `n`)
- `count` remains set to 1. (No change)
- `a` is 2. (No change)
- `b` is 2. (No change)
- `rem` is now equal to `n - 8` and is greater than 0 and even (under the condition that `n` > 8).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than 8; `count` is set to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 8` and is greater than 0 and even.**
