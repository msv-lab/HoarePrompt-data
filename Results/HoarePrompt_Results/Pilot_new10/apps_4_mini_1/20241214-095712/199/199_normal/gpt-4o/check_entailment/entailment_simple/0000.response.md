To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic behind the implementation.

### Problem Summary:
The goal is to find the number of ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. All parts are of positive integer length.
2. These parts can form a rectangle but not a square.

For a rectangle formed by lengths `a`, `a`, `b`, `b`, we need:
- Positive integers `a` and `b` such that `2a + 2b = n` or `a + b = n/2`.
- To ensure it is not a square, we need `a != b`.

### Program Logic:
1. The function starts by checking for `n < 6`. If `n` is less than 6, it returns 0 since it's impossible to form four positive integer lengths.
2. The for loop iterates `a` from 1 to `n // 4 + 1`. However, the values of `b` are hard-coded to always equal `a`, effectively disregarding any alternative lengths for `b`.
3. The remaining length `rem` is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`, which translates to `n - 4a` since `b = a`.
4. The condition checks if `rem > 0` and if `rem` is even in order to ensure `b` could also potentially represent a valid length. 
5. The crucial check that `a != rem // 2` (which provides a value to `b` derived from the remaining length) ensures `a` and `b` are not equal. However, this check doesn't effectively account for the scenario when `2a == rem` (i.e., `a` equals `b`), which should be disallowed since it would represent a square.

### Errors in Logic:
1. The range for `a` only allows for `b` to be equal to `a`, failing to explore other configurations that would yield a valid rectangle without forming a square.
2. The increase of `count` only occurs when `a` does not equal half of the remaining length, but does not directly allow for distinct configurations of different values for `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly enumerate all possible combinations of lengths that satisfy the rectangle condition because it restricts `b` to always equal `a`. This omission prevents it from counting valid configurations correctly.

Thus, the final evaluation indicates that the program does not meet the problem requirements fully.

Correctness: **False**
