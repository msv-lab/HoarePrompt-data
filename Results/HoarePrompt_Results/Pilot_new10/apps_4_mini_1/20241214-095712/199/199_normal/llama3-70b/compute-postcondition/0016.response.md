The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `ways` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` equals 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `ways` is incremented by 1**.
