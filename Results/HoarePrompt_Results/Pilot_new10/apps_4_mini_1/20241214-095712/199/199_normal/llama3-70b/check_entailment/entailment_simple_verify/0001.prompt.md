You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the condition under which the stick can be cut into four parts to form a rectangle, but not a square.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The stick must be cut into four parts.
2. The parts must be of positive integer lengths.
3. The lengths must allow forming a rectangle. This can happen if we have two pairs of equal lengths, say \(a, a, b, b\).
4. The lengths must not allow forming a square like \(x, x, x, x\) for any positive integer \(x\).

The right conditions for counting the pairs are:
- The total length of the stick \(n\) must be even (since we require \(a + a + b + b = n\) or \(2(a + b) = n\)).
- We cannot have all four lengths equal, i.e., \(a = b\).

### Analysis of the Program

The function `func_1(n)` counts valid pairs as follows:

1. The outer loop iterates \(a\) from 1 to \(n // 2\).
2. The inner loop calculates valid values of \(b\) starting from \(a\) up to half the remaining length after subtracting \(a\).
3. A valid configuration is counted only if:
   - \(a \neq b\) (ensuring they are not both the same length).
   - The equation \(2(a + b) = n\) holds (enforcing the rectangle condition).

### Check Edge Cases:
1. **For n = 1:** 
   - Impossible to divide into four parts. The output should be 0. The program will not have any valid pairs and will return 0, which seems acceptable.

2. **For n = 2:** 
   - Similar to n = 1, the output should be 0.

3. **For n = 6:** 
   - The expected output is 1 (the only way being {1, 1, 2, 2}), which is consistent with the outputs provided. The program correctly identifies this.

4. **For n = 4:** 
   - The expected output should be 0, as {1, 1, 1, 1} is not allowed (it forms a square) and you cannot divide 4 into valid different pairs that form a rectangle.

5. **For larger n like n = 20:**
   - It can produce valid pairs and outputs 4, consistent with the problem description. Examples include {1, 1, 9, 9} etc.

### Conclusion:

The program logic fails in some edge cases:
- It fails for odd \(n\) where no valid pairs can be formed but outputs a count of 0.
- Special edge cases with very small integers like \(n=2\) and \(n=4\) are bundled incorrectly.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle every case as per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False** 

### Explanation for False Result:
The program fails to provide correct outputs for certain cases like \(n=2\) and \(n=4\), which are critical constraints specified in the problem description regarding necessary conditions for forming a rectangle without allowing squares.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `ways` is the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) = n` with `1 ≤ a < b` and `b` being within the specified range.
    return ways
    #The program returns the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) = n` with `1 ≤ a < b` and `b` being within the specified range


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
