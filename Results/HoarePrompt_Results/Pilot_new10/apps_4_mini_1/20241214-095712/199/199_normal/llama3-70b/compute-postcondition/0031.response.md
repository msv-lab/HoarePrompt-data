The variable `ways` is incremented by 1. The state of variable `n` remains unchanged (still at least 9), and `a` and `b` are unchanged at 3 and 4 respectively. The updated value of `ways` will now include one more valid pair, reflecting the addition.

Output State: **`n` is at least 9, `a` is 3, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, 4) such that 3 * (3 + 4) == n + 1, `b` is 4**
