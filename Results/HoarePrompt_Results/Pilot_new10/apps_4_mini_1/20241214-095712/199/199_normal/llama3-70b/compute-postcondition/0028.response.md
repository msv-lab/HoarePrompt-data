The statement `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. The initial state specifies that `ways` represents the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that 3 * (3 + b) == n for b in range from 3 to (n - 3) // 2 + 1, along with the constraints that `a` (which is 3) is not equal to `b`, and the current values of `a` and `b` satisfy the equation 2 * (a + b) == n.

Therefore, after the execution of the code:

- `n` remains at least 9.
- `a` is still 3.
- `ways` is incremented by 1, changing its value to `ways + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 9, `a` is 3, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that 3 * (3 + b) == n for `b` in range from 3 to (n - 3) // 2 + 1, and `ways` is increased by 1.**
