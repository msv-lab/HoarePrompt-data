According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `b`, `a`, and `n`. The loop iterates with `b` starting from `a` and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`. If `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1 and `b` is initially 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `b` to be incremented. 

After incrementing `b` by 1, `b` would be 2. For the loop to execute again, the condition must hold, specifically `(n - a) // 2` must be at least 2 (since `b` will be incremented beyond its current value of 1). 

Thus, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **If `n` is at least 4, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, and `ways` remains set to 1 if `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`.**
