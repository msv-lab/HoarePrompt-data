To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze how the variables `n`, `a`, and `ways` are affected by the nested loops. 

The outer loop iterates over `a` from `1` to `n // 2`, and for each value of `a`, the inner loop iterates over `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` checks for valid pairs `(a, b)` such that they satisfy the equation that relates to `n`.

The final value of `ways` represents the total count of distinct pairs `(a, b)` that match the given condition over all valid pairs across all iterations of both loops while ensuring `a` and `b` are distinct (i.e., `a != b`).

To summarize the final state after all iterations:

1. The loop will execute at least zero times if `n < 2` which means `ways` remains `0` because there are no valid pairs when `n` is 1.
2. As `n` increases, valid pairs can increase, and `ways` could accumulate the count of valid pairs `(a, b)` meeting the conditions defined in the loops.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `ways` is the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) = n` with `1 ≤ a < b` and `b` being within the specified range.**
