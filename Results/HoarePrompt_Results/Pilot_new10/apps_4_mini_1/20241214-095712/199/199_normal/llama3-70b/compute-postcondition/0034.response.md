The variable `ways` is incremented by 1. Given that `ways` represents the number of valid pairs (3, 4) such that \(3 \times (3 + 4) = n + 1\), it reflects how many such pairs satisfy this condition. Since `n` is at least 9, the condition can be satisfied for at least the pair (3, 4). The previous state of `ways` does not affect this increment operation, thus only `ways` increases by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 9, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `ways` has increased by 1**.
