To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the requirements closely.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to split a stick of length `n` into four parts, each having positive integer lengths.
2. The cuts must allow us to form a rectangle but not a square.
   - A rectangle requires two pairs of equal lengths.
   - A square requires all four parts to be of equal length (which is not allowed).
   
### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(n)` aims to calculate the number of ways to split the stick as described. Here’s a breakdown of the logic:

- It iterates over all integer lengths `a` from `1` to `n // 2`.
- For each length `a`, it iterates over all possible lengths `b` starting from `a` to half the remaining length `(n - a) // 2`.
- It checks if `2 * (a + b) == n`, implying that we can form pairs `(a, a)` and `(b, b)`.
- It ensures that `a != b` (to ensure it's not a square).
- It counts each valid combination that meets these requirements.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Case:** If `n = 1`, the program does not produce any output since we cannot form any valid lengths.
2. **Valid Pair Test:** For example, if `n = 8`, the pairs it would consider are `(1,1,3,3)` or `(2,2,2,2)`, but `(2,2,2,2)` would be an invalid square case.
3. **General Case:** If `n` is odd (e.g., `n = 7`), it would be impossible to form pairs needed to create a rectangle, as the total must be even.

### Test Case:
Let’s consider `n = 10`. 
- The pairs that would be checked are `(1,1,4,4)` which is valid, `(2,2,3,3)`, and so on.
- The pairs `(5,5)` would be invalid because they would create a square.

This prompts consideration if any value of `n` leads to forming pairs not satisfying the conditions, especially if both `a` and `b` can be the same which creates a square type situation.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly evaluate the counts for the pairs. However, the iterative logic has edge cases that might not entirely validate positive lengths properly leading to incorrect counts when the stick length is small or leads to odd lengths.

After considering multiple scenarios:
- For `n = 9`, the program does not count valid pairs because valid pairs are not checked correctly when both values can be the same, as this leads to a case that may yield a square.

Thus, we have reason to believe that there are inputs that may produce incorrect outputs.

### Final Decision:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not cover all edge cases and could incorrectly determine counts especially for certain lengths or fail to count combinations leading to valid rectangles without squares.
