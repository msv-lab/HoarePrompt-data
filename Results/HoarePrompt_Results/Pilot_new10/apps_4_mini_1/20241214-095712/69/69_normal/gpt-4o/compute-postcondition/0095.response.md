The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000. The parameter `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns:

- If a specific condition is met (Case_1), it returns 0.
- If another condition is fulfilled (Case_2), it returns `min_length` if it is finite, indicating the minimum length of any loop found that meets the target position; otherwise, it returns -1 if no valid loops were found.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a string `operations`, and two integers `x` and `y`, and return either 0, `min_length`, or -1 based on the conditions evaluated within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), operations (a string), x (an integer), and y (an integer), and returns 0, min_length (for valid loops), or -1 (if no valid loops were found).**
