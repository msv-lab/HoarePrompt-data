The variable `final_y` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, `op`, and the condition that `op` is 'D' remain unchanged. The output state needs to reflect that `final_y` has a value that is one less than its previous value, which is unknown. Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters U, D, L, and R, `op` is the first character of `operations` which is not equal to 'U', `op` is 'D', and `final_y` is decreased by 1.
