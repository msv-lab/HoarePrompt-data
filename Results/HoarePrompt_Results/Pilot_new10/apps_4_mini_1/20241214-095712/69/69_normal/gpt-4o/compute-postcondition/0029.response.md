The value of `final_y` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `final_y` is unknown, but it remains unchanged alongside `final_x`. The variable `op` is unmodified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `final_x` remains unchanged; `final_y` is reduced by 1; `op` is the first character in operations.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `final_x` remains unchanged; `final_y` is reduced by 1; `op` is the first character in `operations`.**
