Output State: **`final_x` is the net change in the x-coordinate based on the operations in the string `operations`, `final_y` is the net change in the y-coordinate, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters U, D, L, and R; if the counts of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' in operations are `count_U`, `count_D`, `count_L`, and `count_R` respectively, then `final_x` is `count_R - count_L` and `final_y` is `count_U - count_D`.**
