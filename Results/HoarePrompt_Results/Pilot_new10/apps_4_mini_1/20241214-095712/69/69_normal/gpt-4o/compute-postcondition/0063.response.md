Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), and `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`. The `target_pos` is present in the `position_map`.***
