The variable `current_y` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, so we maintain their previous definitions while reflecting the change in `current_y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_current + 1`, and `current_y` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_current + 1`, `current_y` is increased by 1.**
