The variable `current_y` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as the operation only affects `current_y`. Therefore, in the output state, `current_y` is now `current_y + 1`, and all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y + 1): i}, `i` is `i_current + 2`, and `n` is greater than `i_current + 2**.
