The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `final_y` remains unchanged before this operation, but after executing `final_y += 1`, `final_y` will now be the original value of `final_y` plus 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, `final_x`, and `op` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `final_x` remains unchanged; `final_y` is incremented by 1; `op` is the first character in `operations`.**
