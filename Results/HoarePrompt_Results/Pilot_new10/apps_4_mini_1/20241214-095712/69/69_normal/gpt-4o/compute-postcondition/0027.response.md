According to the code, the loop iterates through each character in the `operations` string. The loop will execute for each character, and if it has reached the end of the string, it means that it will not execute anymore. At the end of the last iteration, we still have `n` as a positive integer (between 1 and 200000 inclusive) and `operations` as a non-empty string. 

Since the loop is set to iterate over `operations`, if the loop has executed once for each character, then for the loop to execute one more time, we would need to be in a state where there are more characters to read. However, the problem states if `op` is beyond the last character in `operations`, we do not execute the loop body. Therefore, we need to examine if there are additional characters remaining to trigger another loop iteration.

Based on this:
- If `final_x` and `final_y` were modified according to the last `op`, and `op` may already be beyond the last character of `operations`, there won’t be another iteration. 

Thus, it’s clear that for the loop to execute again, 'op' must be able to access a valid index in `operations`. Therefore, the index that `op` points to should be at the start (0) for another loop iteration, meaning we need to reset the index to the beginning.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`, final_x remains unchanged, final_y remains unchanged, op is the first character in `operations` (i.e., `op` is operations[0])**
