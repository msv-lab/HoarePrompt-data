Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`; `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`; `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}; `i` is `i_current + 2`; `n` is greater than `i_current + 2; current_x` is increased by 1.**
