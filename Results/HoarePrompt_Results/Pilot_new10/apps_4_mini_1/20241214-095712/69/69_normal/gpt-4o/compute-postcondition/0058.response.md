Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), `current_x` is 1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `operations[i]` is 'R' if the operation at index `i` is 'R'. No changes occur for other operations at index `i` since there is no else part in the code.***
