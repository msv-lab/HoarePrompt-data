The variable `final_x` is decremented by 1, but its initial value is unknown. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters U, D, L, and R, `op` is the first character of `operations`, and the current value of `op` is 'L', and `final_x` is decreased by 1.
