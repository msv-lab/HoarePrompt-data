Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is `i_current + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i_current + 1`. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` may be updated to min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos]).***
