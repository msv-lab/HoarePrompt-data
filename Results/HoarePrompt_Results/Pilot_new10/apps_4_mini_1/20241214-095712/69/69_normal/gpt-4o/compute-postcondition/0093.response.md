Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `min_length` is the minimum length of any loop found that meets the target position, `current_x` and `current_y` are the final coordinates based on the operations in the list, and `position_map` contains keys representing all unique positions visited during the loop along with their corresponding index. If `n` is 0, `current_x` and `current_y` will remain 0, and `position_map` will only contain {(0, 0): -1}.**
