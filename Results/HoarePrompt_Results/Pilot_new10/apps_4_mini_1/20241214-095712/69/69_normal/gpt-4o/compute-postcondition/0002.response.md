According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `operations` string. For the loop to execute, the `operations` string must have at least one character since it iterates through each character in the string. Given that `n` is a positive integer, it could be any value from 1 to 200000, implying that `operations` will also have a length between 1 and 200000. 

Additionally, since we are initializing `final_x` and `final_y` to 0, they will be used to track the cumulative effects of the operations as they are processed over the iterations, but the loop's execution is solely dependent on the `operations` variable being non-empty.

Since the loop starts with `op` defined as a character in the `operations` string:
- We need to ensure that `op` can reference the first character of `operations`. 

Therefore, the initial state must ensure that `n` is at least 1, that `operations` is non-empty, and that `op` is the first character of `operations`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a non-empty string of length n consisting of characters U, D, L, and R, `op` is the first character of `operations`**
