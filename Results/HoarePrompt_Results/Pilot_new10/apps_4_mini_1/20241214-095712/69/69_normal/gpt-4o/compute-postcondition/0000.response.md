The variable `final_x` is assigned the value `0`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions along with the updated value of `final_x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters U, D, L, and R, `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0**.
