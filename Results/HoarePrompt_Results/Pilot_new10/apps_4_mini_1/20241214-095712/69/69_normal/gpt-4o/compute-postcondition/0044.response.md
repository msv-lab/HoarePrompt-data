`current_y` is assigned the value of 0. The other variables remain unaffected and their previous values do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 0.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 0**.
