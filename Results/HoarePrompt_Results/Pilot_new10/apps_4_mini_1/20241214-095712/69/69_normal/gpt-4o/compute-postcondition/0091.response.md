Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, and `target_pos` is equal to (`current_x + (x - final_x)`, `current_y + (y + count_D - count_U)`). If `target_pos` is present in `position_map`, then `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the difference between `i` and `position_map[target_pos]`.***
