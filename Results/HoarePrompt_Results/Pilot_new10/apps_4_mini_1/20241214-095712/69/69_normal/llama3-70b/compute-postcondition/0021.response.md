The value of `uy` is incremented by 1. Other variables such as `n`, `operations`, `op`, `ux`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged in this context. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is set to the next character in `operations`, `ux` is unchanged, `ly` is unchanged, and `uy` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is set to the next character in `operations`, `ux` is unchanged, `ly` is unchanged, `uy` is increased by 1**.
