Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` must have a length of at least `len(ops) + 1`, and `op` must be the next character in `ops`. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, `dx` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` is increased by 1.***
