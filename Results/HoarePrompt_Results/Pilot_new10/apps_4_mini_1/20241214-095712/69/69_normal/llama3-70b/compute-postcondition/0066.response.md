The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the previous value of `dx`, but since it's being modified, we conclude that `dx` will now hold a value that is one greater than its previous value. As the values of the other variables are not affected by this operation, `n`, `operations`, `ops`, and `op` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` must have a length of at least `len(ops) + 1`, `op` must be the next character in `ops`, and `dx` is incremented by 1.**
