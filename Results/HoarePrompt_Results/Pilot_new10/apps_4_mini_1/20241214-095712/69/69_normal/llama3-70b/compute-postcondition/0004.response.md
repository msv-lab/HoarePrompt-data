According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ops`. The loop iterates through each character in the `ops` string, and for the loop to execute at least once, `ops` must have a length greater than 0. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a string whose length equals `n`, it ensures that `ops` can be a valid string. Since `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are initialized as 0, these values do not affect the ability of the loop to execute.

To ensure that the loop can run, we can state that `ops` is non-empty. Therefore, we also set the initial value of `op` to the first character of `ops`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is the input string, `op` is the first character in `ops`, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0**
