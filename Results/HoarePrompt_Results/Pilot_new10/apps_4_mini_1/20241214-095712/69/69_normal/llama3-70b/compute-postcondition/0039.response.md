The operation assigns values to `dx` and `dy` based on the calculations involving `x`, `ux`, `y`, and `uy`. Here, `dx` calculates `x` minus the net effect of the 'R' and 'L' operations (`ux`), and `dy` calculates `y` minus the net effect of the 'U' and 'D' operations (`uy`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state maintains the original information while updating the values of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the net effect of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the net effect of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`.**
