Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations and `operations` is a non-empty string. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than or equal to 0, then the conditions regarding `dy` are satisfied. Otherwise, if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is greater than or equal to -1. In all other cases, either `op` is not 'L' or `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is increased by 1.***
