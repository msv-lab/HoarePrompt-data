The value of `dy` is incremented by 1. Since `dy` is the only variable that is affected, the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state therefor still holds for `n`, `operations`, `ops`, and `op`, and now `dy` will simply be one unit higher than its original value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` must have a length of at least `len(ops) + 1`, `op` must be the next character in `ops`, `dy` is incremented by 1**.
