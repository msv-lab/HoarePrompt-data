The function `func` accepts three parameters: 

1. `n`, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000.
2. `operations`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
3. `x` and `y`, which are integers that can take values between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive.

After executing the function, it performs a series of movements based on the `operations` string starting from the coordinates `(x, y)`. Each character in the `operations` string corresponds to a movement in the respective direction:

- 'U' (up) increases the y-coordinate by 1.
- 'D' (down) decreases the y-coordinate by 1.
- 'L' (left) decreases the x-coordinate by 1.
- 'R' (right) increases the x-coordinate by 1.

The final output of the function is the resulting coordinates `(final_x, final_y)` after all movements are applied to the initial coordinates `(x, y)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), operations (a string of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'), and x, y (integers), and returns the final coordinates after applying the specified movements from the initial (x, y) coordinates.**
