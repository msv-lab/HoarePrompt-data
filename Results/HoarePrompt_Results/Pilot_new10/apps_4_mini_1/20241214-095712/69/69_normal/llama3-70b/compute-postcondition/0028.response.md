Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a non-empty string. If `op` is 'U', then `ly` remains unchanged, `ux` remains unchanged, and `uy` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', both `ux` and `uy` are decremented by 1, while `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is incremented by 1, while `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are updated according to the new `op`. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decreased by 1, and `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are updated according to the new `op`.***
