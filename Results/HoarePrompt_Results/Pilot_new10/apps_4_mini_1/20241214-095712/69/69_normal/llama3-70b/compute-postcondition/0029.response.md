To determine the appropriate states for the loop execution, we need to consider the values and conditions provided at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The variable `n` is a positive integer, which indicates the length of the `operations` (string) we are working with. 
2. The string `operations` is non-empty, implying there is at least one operation to process, meaning the loop can execute at least once.
3. The variable `op` represents the current operation being processed. Depending on the value of `op` ('U', 'D', 'R', 'L'), different adjustments are made to `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`.

If the loop has completed one iteration and `ops` still contains operations, we need to prepare the state for the next iteration by updating `op` and adjusting the respective states according to the operation.

Given this, the adjustments for the next state depend on the following:

- If there are remaining operations after the last processed operation, `op` will refer to the next operation in the sequence.
- The indices or counters related to the operations will change accordingly.

Thus, if `operations` is a non-empty string, it will have another character to process, which means we must ensure that `n` remains greater than the current index (to allow for more operations) and the variables (`ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`) will be updated based on the next operation.

Assuming we will adjust for `op` being the next character in the string at a 0-based index and subsequently adjust the positions or indices of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly` based on the new operation.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next character in `operations`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly` are updated based on the new `op`.**
