You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem requirements and check for any potential cases where it could fail.

The problem states that we need to calculate the minimum length of subsegment in a sequence of operations that must be changed so that a robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(x, y)`. The program must also handle the case where it is impossible to reach the target coordinates.

### Analysis of the Code
1. The program first reads the number of operations `n`, the operations string `ops`, and the target coordinates `(x, y)`.
2. It then calculates the `ux` and `uy` variables by simulating the movements specified in the operations string.
3. The differences `(dx, dy)` are computed to determine how many additional movements are needed in each direction (up, down, left, right) after completing the operations given.
4. If either `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, this means that there are more movements towards that direction than what is in the sequence, hence reaching the target is impossible and prints `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it attempts to iterate through the operations and counts how many changes would need to be made to achieve the necessary movements.

### Potential Cases for Failure
Let's analyze if there are any cases where the logic may not hold:

1. **Case of Exact Matches**: If the operations string perfectly leads to `(x, y)`, the code correctly outputs `0`, which is fine.
2. **Case of Infeasibility**: The program returns `-1` if there are not enough moves in one direction (for example, needing to move left when there are no `L` operations) which seems logically correct.
3. **Counting Changes**: The program keeps a count of needed changes based on the remaining `dx` and `dy` values as it traverses the operations string. The logic is problematic:
    - For each operation checked, it decreases `dx` or `dy` if that movement is still required. If none of the movements in the string are necessary anymore, it counts as a change. This is misleading and doesn’t correctly reflect the minimum changes required, as it does not necessarily ensure the segment changed is correct.

### Example of Failure
Consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  RULR
  1 1
  ```
- Expected Output: `0` (as it exactly gets to `(1, 1)`)
  
Now consider an edge case:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  UUUUU
  -3 -3
  ```
- Expected Output: `-1` (impossible to reach `(-3, -3)` as there are not enough left or down movements).
- However, the program fails to handle this as it assumes there could be potential room to change the operations without verifying if it's genuinely possible based on input constraints.

Thus the program does not handle the logical transitions correctly.

### Conclusion
Given these inconsistencies, particularly in how changes are counted and the logic regarding movement requirements, the program does not adhere correctly to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), operations is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and x and y are integers with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ux, uy, lx, ly = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the net effect of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the net effect of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0 and `ly` is 0.
    dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy
    if (dx < 0 or dy < 0) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations; `res` is the count of ignored operations; `dx` is equal to `max(0, x - ux - R_count)` where `R_count` is the number of 'R' operations; `dy` is equal to `max(0, y - uy - U_count)` where `U_count` is the number of 'U' operations; `ops` represents the executed operations resulting in changes.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations. If either `dx` or `dy` is less than 0, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, `dx` is updated to be the maximum of `0` or `x - ux - R_count`, `dy` is updated to be the maximum of `0` or `y - uy - U_count`, and `res` represents the count of ignored operations with `ops` reflecting the executed operations resulting in changes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of operations), a string `ops` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' representing movement directions, and two integers `x` and `y` as starting coordinates. It calculates the net effect of the operations on coordinates based on the movements. If the remaining distance in either the x or y direction is negative after applying the movements, it returns -1. Otherwise, it counts and returns the number of operations that did not change the position (i.e., ignored operations) needed to reach the final targeted coordinates (x, y).
