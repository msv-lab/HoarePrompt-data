Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is derived from `operations`, and `op` is the first character of `operations`. It is not the case that `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0; therefore, either `op` is not 'L' or `dx` is greater than or equal to 0.***
