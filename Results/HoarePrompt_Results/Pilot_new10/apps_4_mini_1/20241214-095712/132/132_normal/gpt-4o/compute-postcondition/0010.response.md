The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is a list of integers, and the number of integers in `x` is defined by the integer parameter `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\). Each integer in the list `x` (denoted as \(x_i\)) satisfies the condition \(0 \leq x_i \leq 1000\). Similarly, the parameter `y` is a list of integers of the same length `n`, where each integer in `y` (denoted as \(y_i\)) also satisfies the condition \(0 \leq y_i \leq 1000\). After executing the function body, the function will perform some operations based on these lists that result in a specific output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a list x and a list y, both containing n integers within specified ranges, and returns a value based on the computations involving these lists.**
