The code takes input for the list `y`, where `y` will contain `n` integers, each derived from user input. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged, while `y` takes on new values based on the input. The variable `y` is now populated with a list of integers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, where each integer `x_i` is in the range 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is now a list of `n` integers derived from input, where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000.**
