`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input which must satisfy the condition `1 <= n <= 50`. The states of the other variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they do not affect the current operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `x_i` is in the range 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000.**
