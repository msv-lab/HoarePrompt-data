The value of `x` is assigned a new list derived from the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which processes input as integers. Since `n` indicates the number of integers that will fill the list `x`, the exact values in `x` will now depend on the input provided, while still adhering to the precondition that each element `x_i` must be in the range 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000.

The output state will confirm that `y` remains unchanged while `x` now holds a list of `n` integers derived from input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, where each integer `x_i` is in the range 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000.**
