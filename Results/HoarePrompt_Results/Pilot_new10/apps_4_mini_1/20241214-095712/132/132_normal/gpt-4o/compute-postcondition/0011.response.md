Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers. It calculates the total sum of the integers in both lists. If the sum of the integers in list `y` is greater than that in list `x`, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return a value but provides output based on the comparison of the sums. **
