Initially, `y` is assigned values by taking input, which is transformed into a list of integers through `map(int, input().split())`. The variable `n` dictates the length of this list, and `y` will now contain `n` integers, each of which satisfies the condition `0 <= y[i] <= 1000`. The initial states of `n` and `x` remain unchanged since we are only updating the `y` variable.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, each satisfying 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000.**
