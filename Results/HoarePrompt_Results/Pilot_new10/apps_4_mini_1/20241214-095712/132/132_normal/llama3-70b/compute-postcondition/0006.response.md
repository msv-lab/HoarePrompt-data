The code `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in ascending order. The value of `n` does not change, and since `x` contains integers between 0 and 1000, after sorting, `x` will be organized from the smallest to the largest of its elements. The total sum of the elements in `x` remains equal to the total sum of the elements in `y`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, each satisfying 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
