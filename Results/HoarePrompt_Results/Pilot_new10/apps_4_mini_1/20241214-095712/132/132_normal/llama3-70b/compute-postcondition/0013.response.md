Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers derived from input, each satisfying 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000. If the sum of the integers in `x` is not equal to the sum of the integers in `y`, the output is 'No'. Otherwise, if the sums are equal and `x` is equal to `y`, the output is 'Yes'; if the sums are equal but `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is 'No'.***
