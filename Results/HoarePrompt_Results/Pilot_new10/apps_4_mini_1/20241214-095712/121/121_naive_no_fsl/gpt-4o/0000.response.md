Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of nucleotides is exactly divisible by 4 but the counts of the recognized nucleotides prevent a valid distribution. 

Hereâ€™s a specific counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
8
AA??GTTT
```

In this case, `n = 8`, so each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') should appear exactly `8 / 4 = 2` times. 

The counts from the input string would be:
- 'A': 2
- 'C': 0
- 'G': 1
- 'T': 3

The existing counts already exceed the required counts for 'T' (3 > 2) and the allowed count for 'C' (0 < 2). 

When the program processes,
1. It would identify that `counts['T']` is greater than `target_count` and print `===`.
2. However, it does not account for the fact that while 4 can be evenly distributed, the specific counts of the nucleotides make it impossible to fill the `?` characters appropriately.

Since this case would produce `===` although it is possible to replace `?` with 'C' and 'G' to reach the desired counts of 2 for each nucleotide, the algorithm fails to recognize valid fill options. 

Hence, the program does not address potential distributions correctly and is considered incorrect.
