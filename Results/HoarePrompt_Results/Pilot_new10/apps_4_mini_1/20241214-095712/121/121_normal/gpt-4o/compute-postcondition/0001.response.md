The variable `data` is assigned the value obtained by reading from the input and splitting it into a list. The variable `input` is defined as the function `sys.stdin.read`, which reads all input data as a single string. After reading and splitting, `data` will contain the input values split by whitespace.

The states of the other variables, `n` and `s`, remain unaffected by this operation. However, the exact content of `data` will depend on what input is passed to `sys.stdin.read`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length n containing characters from the set {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'}; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string into separate elements based on whitespace.**
