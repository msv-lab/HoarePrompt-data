The `break` statement causes the execution to exit from the most immediate enclosing loop or conditional block. The variables `n`, `s`, `data`, `target_count`, `result`, and `counts` retain their previous values since the `break` does not alter any of them. Therefore, the Output State maintains the existing values of all variables and notes that the most immediate loop or statement has been exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `result[i]` is assigned the value of `char`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
