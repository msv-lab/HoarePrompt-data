Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with all counts less than or equal to `target_count`, `result` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `i` is 0, `char` will represent the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' in counts, and the current value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`.***
