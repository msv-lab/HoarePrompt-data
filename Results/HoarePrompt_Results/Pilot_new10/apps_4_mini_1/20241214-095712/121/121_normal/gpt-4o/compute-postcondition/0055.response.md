Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with each count equal to `target_count`. If `result[i]` is '?', the character at index `i` in `result` is assigned such that all counts will be equal to `target_count` at the end, ensuring that the characters in `result` from index 0 to the last used index are all represented by the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.***
