Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with each count equal to `target_count` if there were no '?', or all counts balanced such that the characters in `result` are filled appropriately, meeting the count target without exceeding. If there are still '?', they remain in `result` after all assignments.**
