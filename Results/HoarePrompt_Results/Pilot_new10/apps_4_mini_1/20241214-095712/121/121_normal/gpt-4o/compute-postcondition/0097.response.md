Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 4 <= n <= 255) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'}. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 4; if not, it prints '===' and returns nothing. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`, ensuring none exceed `n/4`. If any character does, it also prints '===' and returns nothing. The function replaces '?' in the string to balance counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to be equal to `n/4`. Finally, it prints the modified string without returning a value. If there are still '?' left after all replacements, they remain unchanged. The function handles edge cases related to count validation and ensures constraints on input are followed before processing.**
