The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` has keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', each equal to `target_count + 2`; `char` is the next character in the counts dictionary; `result[i]` is equal to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
