The value of `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. Prior to this line of code, `counts` is guaranteed to have at least one key with a count that is less than `target_count`. After executing the code, the count of `char` in `counts` will be increased, which may then no longer be less than `target_count`, depending on its previous value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` must have keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with at least one count less than or equal to `target_count - 1`; `result[0]` is assigned the value of `char`; `i` remains 0; the count of `char` in `counts` is now one greater than its previous value.**
