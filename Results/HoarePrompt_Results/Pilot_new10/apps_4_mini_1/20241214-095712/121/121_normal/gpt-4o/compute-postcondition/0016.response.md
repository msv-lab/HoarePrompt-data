Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `s` is equal to `data[1]`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}; if `char` is in `counts`, then the current state of `counts` is updated accordingly. If `char` is not in `counts`, the state of `counts` remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
