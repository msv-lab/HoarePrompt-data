You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we analyze the core requirements and how the code implements them.

### Key Requirements:

1. **Equal Distribution:** The program must ensure that after replacing '?', the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' must all be equal.
2. **Replacement of '?':** The '?' characters in the string should be replaced with nucleotides in such a way that their counts become equal.
3. **Input Validity:** If the total length `n` of the string is not divisible by 4, it is immediately impossible to have equal counts for all four nucleotides.

### Program Logic:

1. The program first checks if `n % 4 != 0`. If not, it prints '===' as it is impossible to have equal counts.
2. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
3. If any nucleotide's count exceeds `target_count` (which is `n // 4`), it again prints '===' since it’s impossible to equalize the counts.
4. It then iterates over the string, replacing '?' with the nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that are below the target count, until all '?' are replaced or the target balance is achieved.
5. Finally, the modified string is printed.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Input where `n` is divisible by 4, but already has unequal distribution.**
   - Example: Input `8` with `s = "AA??G???"`
   - Here, after counting, we have `A = 2`, `C = 0`, `G = 1`, `T = 0` with 4 '?' characters to replace. Clearly, it's impossible to convert this to `A = 2`, `C = 2`, `G = 2`, `T = 2` due to the excess of 'A's.
   
2. **All nucleotides are '?'.**
   - Input: `n = 8` and `s = "????????"`
   - The program should produce a valid sequence like "ACGTACGT", but if it does something else, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, there exists an edge case:
- The string has initial counts that make it impossible to reach an equal nucleotide distribution even for valid `n`.

This implies the following:

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation of the failure:** The program fails in scenarios where it counts the nucleotides and cannot replace '?' effectively due to the pre-existing conditions of unequal counts, leading to incorrect handling of nucleotides.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (where 4 <= n <= 255) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'}. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 4; if not, it prints '===' and returns nothing. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`, ensuring none exceed `n/4`. If any character does, it also prints '===' and returns nothing. The function replaces '?' in the string to balance counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to be equal to `n/4`. Finally, it prints the modified string without returning a value. If there are still '?' left after all replacements, they remain unchanged. The function handles edge cases related to count validation and ensures constraints on input are followed before processing. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
