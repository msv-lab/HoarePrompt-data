Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` has keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with at least one count greater than `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[0]` is set to `char`, and `counts[char]` is increased by 1 while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no updates are made.***
