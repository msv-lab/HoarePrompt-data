Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, no action is taken since there is no else part in the code.***
