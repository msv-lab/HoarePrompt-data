Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` has keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with at least one count greater than `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `result[0]` is assigned the value of `char`, and `i` remains 0 while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, there is no change to `counts`, `result`, or `i`.***
