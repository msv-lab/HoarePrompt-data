Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string. If the count of `char` in `counts` exceeds `target_count`, the function reaches the end without a return value and prints '===', leaving `counts` unchanged. If the count does not exceed `target_count`, the function also reaches the end without any return value and leaves `counts` unchanged.***
