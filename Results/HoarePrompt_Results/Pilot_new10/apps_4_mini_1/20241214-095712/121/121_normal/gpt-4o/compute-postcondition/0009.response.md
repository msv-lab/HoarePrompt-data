`counts` is initialized as a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', all set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters from the set {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'}, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string into separate elements based on whitespace; `s` is equal to `data[1]`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.**
