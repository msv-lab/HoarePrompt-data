Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` has keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' such that all counts are equal to `target_count`, indicating that the characters have been fully utilized. If `result[i]` is '?', then `result[i]` is filled with the next character from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to ensure that the counts meet their corresponding `target_count`.***
