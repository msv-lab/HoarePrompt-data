The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n-1`; `count[nc]` is greater than or equal to 0; `res` is incremented by the value of `nc`; `count[nc]` is now decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
