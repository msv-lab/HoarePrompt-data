Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; if there is at least one non-zero value in `count`, `res` contains all non-'?' characters from `s` along with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' added in the order based on their presence in `count`, reflecting the remaining occurrences after processing all '?' characters in `s`. If all values for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `count` are zero, then `res` consists solely of the non-'?' characters from `s` which are printed.***
