The code appends the character `c` to the string `res`. Given that the (n)th character is not equal to '?', `res` is updated by adding this character. The values of `n`, `s`, and `count` remain unchanged since this operation only modifies `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1`, `count` is updated appropriately, `res` is updated by adding the character `c`.**
