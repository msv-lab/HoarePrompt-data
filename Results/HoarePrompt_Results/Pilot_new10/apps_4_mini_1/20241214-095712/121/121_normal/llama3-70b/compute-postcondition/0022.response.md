The variable `res` is assigned an empty string. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. The values of `n`, `s`, `count`, and `avg` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `count` is updated as `count['A']` = `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` = `avg - count['C']`, `count['G']` = `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` = `avg - count['T']`, where `avg` is `n // 4`, and `c` has taken all values in the sequence 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'; `res` is an empty string.**
