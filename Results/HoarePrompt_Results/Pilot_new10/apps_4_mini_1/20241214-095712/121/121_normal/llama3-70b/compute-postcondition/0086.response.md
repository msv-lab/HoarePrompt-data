Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; if `c` is equal to '?', then `res` contains up to the first `count` number of characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', with `count` decremented by the occurrences in `res`. If any character in 'ACGT' has a count greater than 0, it could potentially be included in `res`. Otherwise, `c` is included in `res`.***
