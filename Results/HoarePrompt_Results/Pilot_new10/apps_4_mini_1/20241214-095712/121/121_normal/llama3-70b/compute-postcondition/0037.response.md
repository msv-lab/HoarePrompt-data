After executing the code `res += nc`, the variable `res` is updated by appending `nc`, which is the next character in the sequence that has not yet been processed. The state of `n`, `s`, and `nc` does not change as a result of this operation, but `res` will include `nc` now. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` is updated by adding `nc`, which is the next unprocessed character in the sequence.**
