You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` (length of the genome) and a string `s` (the genome sequence).

2. **Count Calculation:**
   - It counts the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the string by iterating over `s`.
   - It then calculates `avg` as `n // 4`, which is the target number of each nucleotide type.

3. **Count Adjustment:**
   - For each nucleotide type, the program calculates how many more of that type are needed to reach `avg`.

4. **Replacement Logic:**
   - The program constructs a result string where it replaces '?' with the needed nucleotides while keeping track of the counts.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After attempting to replace all '?', the program checks if there are still any unmet counts for the nucleotides. If there are, it prints "==="; otherwise, it prints the resulting string.

### Potential Issue

**Edge Case:**
- Consider the input `8` followed by `A???C???`. 
  - The counts after the initial scan would be: A=1, C=1, G=0, T=0, which means we need 1 more G and 1 more T, and we have 5 '?'. 
  - The program has correct logic for replacing '?', but it will replace it as follows:
    - It might replace the '?' in such a way that it can't ensure 2 of each nucleotide if not careful (e.g., it might end up replacing them without keeping balance).
    
- Therefore, if any instance arises where the result cannot guarantee the necessary number of each nucleotide evenly, as the program currently checks the conditions after replacements and not tightly maintains individual nucleotide requirements during replacements.
  
- This could lead to incorrect answers where it still has sufficient '?', but the nucleotides do not satisfy equal distribution.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not guarantee that all nucleotides are equal after the replacements based on how it approaches the construction of the result string. This leads to potential inconsistencies with the expected output.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting solely of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts the occurrences of each character and calculates the average number of 'A's, 'C's, 'G's, and 'T's that should ideally be present for balance. The function then replaces the '?' characters in `s` with the required characters ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') to achieve this balance, in the order they are needed. If it is not possible to replace all '?' characters while satisfying the required counts, the function prints '===', otherwise, it prints the modified string `res`. Edge cases include handling scenarios where all characters in `s` are '?' or when the input string already has a balanced number of 'A's, 'C's, 'G's, and 'T's. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
