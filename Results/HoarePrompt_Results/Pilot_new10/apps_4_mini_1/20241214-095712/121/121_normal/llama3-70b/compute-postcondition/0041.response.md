Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` represents remaining counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' after all possible characters have been used up, `res` is a string comprised of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' added in the order of their presence in `count` until `count[nc]` was no longer greater than 0 for any of them. If `count` for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' is zero, `res` remains an empty string.**
