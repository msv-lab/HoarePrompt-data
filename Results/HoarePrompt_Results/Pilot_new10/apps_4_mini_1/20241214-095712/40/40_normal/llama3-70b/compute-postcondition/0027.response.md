Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `substr` is equal to `s[n - 1:n + 1]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 1.***
