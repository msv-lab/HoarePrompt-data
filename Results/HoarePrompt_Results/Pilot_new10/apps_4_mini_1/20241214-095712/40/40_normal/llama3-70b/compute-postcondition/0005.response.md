The code assigns the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j` to the variable `substr`. In this case, since `i` is `0` and `j` is `1`, `substr` will contain the first character of `s`. The other variables could remain unchanged, so the output state will maintain their existing values. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` starts at 1, and `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
