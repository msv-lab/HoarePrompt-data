The variable `substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, which means it takes the substring of `s` starting from index `i` up to (but not including) index `j`. 

Given that `i` is equal to `n - 1` and `j` is equal to `n + 1`, the substring will be:

- The starting index `i` (which is `n - 1`) refers to the last character of the string `s`.
- The ending index `j` (which is `n + 1`) extends beyond the length of the string but Python handles this by simply taking the substring until the end of the string.

As a result, `substr` will contain the last two characters of the string `s` (from index `n - 1` to `n`).

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `substr` is equal to the last two characters of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `substr` is equal to `s[n - 1:n + 1]`.**
