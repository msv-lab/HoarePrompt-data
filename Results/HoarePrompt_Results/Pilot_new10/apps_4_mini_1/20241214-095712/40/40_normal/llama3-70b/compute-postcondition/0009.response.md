According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. In the loop, `j` starts at `1` and will be incremented by `1` each time the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`, and since `n` is equal to the length of `s`, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n` (the length of the string `s`). 

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `1`, so it will be `2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least `2`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j is 2`, and `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
