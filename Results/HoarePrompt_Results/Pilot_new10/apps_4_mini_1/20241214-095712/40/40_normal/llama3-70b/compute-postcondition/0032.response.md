To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze how the `max_len` variable is updated throughout the iterations. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` (which is `n` because `i = n - 1`) and goes up to `j = n + 1`. The substring `substr` is created from `s[i:j]`, and the condition checks whether this substring is not equal to its reverse. 

1. At the first iteration, when `j = n`, `substr` becomes `s[n - 1:n]`, which is the last character of the string. If that character is not equal to its reverse (which is itself), `max_len` would be updated to 1.
   
2. At the second iteration, when `j = n + 1`, `substr` equals `s[n - 1:n + 1]`, which means it includes the last character and goes beyond the string. In appropriate circumstances during the substring's checks, if it confirms to be not a palindrome, `max_len` remains at 1 if previously updated or could change to 2 based on checks.

The loop effectively will check every possible substring that stretches from the character `s[n-1]` to the end of the string, adjusting `max_len` whenever a valid non-palindrome substring is identified. Thus, once the loop concludes (in this case, it completes two iterations since it begins with `j = n` and ends on `j = n + 1`), `max_len` will hold the length of the longest identified non-palindrome substring derived from the complete string `s`.

In cases where the string is just a single character or a palindrome, `max_len` might not be updated from its original (possibly 0 or 1).

Following these observations, the final state after the loop completes its designated iterations is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s`.**
