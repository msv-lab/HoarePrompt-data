In the given initial state, we have the following specifics:
- `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is assigned the value of `n - 1`.
- `j` is assigned the value of `n + 1`.
- `substr` is equal to `s[n - 1:n + 1]`, which means it will contain the last character of `s` and an additional character that doesn't exist, resulting in `substr` containing only the last character of `s`.

Now, the code executes the following line:
```
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

Here, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` contains the last character of `s`, its length is `1`. Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to the maximum of `max_len` and `1`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `substr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `substr` is equal to `s[n - 1:n + 1]`, `max_len` is updated to max(max_len, 1)**.
