According to the code, the for loop's execution depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n`. Since at the end of the last iteration `j` is equal to `n + 1`, this indicates that the loop cannot execute again because `j` is already out of the range defined by `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, and the loop's boundary condition is such that it will not execute if `j` is greater than `n`. Therefore, to allow for an additional execution of the loop, `j` must be set to a maximum of `n`, thereby allowing it to perform checks from `i + 1` to `n`, and `n` is equal to the length of `s`.

As such, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be set to `n` (the length of `s`).
- The loop will check conditions for `j` equal to `n`, thus allowing for the last string segment to be processed.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `n`, `substr` is equal to `s`, and if `s` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is now the maximum of its previous value and `n`.**
