Let's analyze the code step by step.

1. The variable `substr` is defined as `s[i:n]`, which means it represents the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and going to the end of the string. The length of `substr` is calculated as `len(substr)`, which equals `n - i` since `n` is the length of `s` and `j` is equal to `n`.

2. The variable `max_len` is updated using the expression `max(max_len, len(substr))`. Since `len(substr)` is equal to `n - i`, this means we're calculating the maximum of `max_len` and `n - i`.

3. If `s` is not a palindrome, we can infer that `max_len` may potentially increase. If it is a palindrome, `max_len` will remain unchanged as we're only setting its new value based on the current values.

Since we do not have the specific values of `max_len` and `n - i`, we can still express the result in terms of these variables.

Given that we have identified how the code affects the variables, here is the resulting output state:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `n`, `substr` is equal to `s[i:n]`, and `max_len` is equal to `max(previous max_len, n - i)`**.
