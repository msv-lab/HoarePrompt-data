`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, where `i` is unchanged and `j` is equal to `n`. This means `substr` will be the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to index `j` (which is the length of `s`). Since `s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `substr` will effectively be equal to the portion of `s` from `i` to the end of the string. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `n`, `substr` is equal to `s[i:n]` (the substring from index `i` to the end of `s`), and if `s` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is now the maximum of its previous value and `n`.**
