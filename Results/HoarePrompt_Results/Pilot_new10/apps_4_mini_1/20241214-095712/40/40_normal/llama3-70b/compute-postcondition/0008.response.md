Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` starts at 1, and `substr` is the first character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1.***
