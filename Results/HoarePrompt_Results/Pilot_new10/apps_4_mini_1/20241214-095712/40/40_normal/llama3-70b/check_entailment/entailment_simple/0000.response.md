Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements as described in the problem statement. Let's break down how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a single string `s` from the input, which is specified to be non-empty and only contains lowercase letters of a maximum length of 50 characters. This aligns with the input constraints given in the problem description.

2. **Finding Non-palindrome Substrings**: The nested for-loops iterate through all possible substrings of the string `s`. The outer loop index `i` starts from 0 and goes to `n-1`, while the inner loop index `j` starts from `i+1` and goes to `n`. This ensures that all possible substrings are considered.

3. **Checking for Palindromes**: For each substring generated, the program checks if it is a palindrome by comparing the substring to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`). If the substring is not equal to its reverse, it is confirmed not to be a palindrome.

4. **Keeping Track of the Longest Non-palindrome**: The variable `max_len` is used to store the maximum length of substrings that are not palindromes. Whenever the condition for a non-palindrome is met, `max_len` is updated with the maximum length found so far.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints `max_len` if it is greater than 0; otherwise, it prints 0. This correctly reflects the requirement to print the length of the longest non-palindromic substring or 0 if no such substring exists.

6. **Correctness of Logic**: 
   - If the input string itself is not a palindrome (like "mew"), the whole string is returned, and its length is printed.
   - If all substrings of the string are palindromic (like "qqqqqqqq"), `max_len` remains 0, fulfilling the requirement to print 0.
   - The program effectively accounts for all cases by evaluating all substrings and adjusting `max_len` accordingly.

In conclusion, the logic within the program adheres to the specification of the problem description, consistently providing correct outputs for all expected input scenarios.
