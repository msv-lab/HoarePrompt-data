Given the details provided:

The loop iterates over the string `s`, starting from the first character and checking for substrings that are not palindromic. The variable `max_len` is updated to reflect the length of the longest substring found that is not equal to its reverse.

After all iterations of the loop have completed:

- The total length of the string `s` (denoted as `n`) has been assessed for all possible substrings starting from index `i` (which remains 0 throughout). 
- For all substrings of length from 1 up to `n`, `max_len` would contain the maximum length of any substring found that is not a palindrome.
- If `s` is fully palindromic, `max_len` will not change from its initial value (assumed 0).

Thus, we can infer the following output state based on the maximum length assessment:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not equal to its reverse.**
