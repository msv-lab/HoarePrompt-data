The code assigns a new value to `area` based on the expression `n * m / k`. Given the constraints (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 10^9 and 2 <= `k` <= 10^9), it results in a calculated area which is the product of `n` and `m` divided by `k`. The preconditions for `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), and `area` is calculated as `n * m / k`.**
