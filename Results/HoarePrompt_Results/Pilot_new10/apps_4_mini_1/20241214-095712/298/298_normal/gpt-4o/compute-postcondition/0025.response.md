The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the constraints provided, which state that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with specific bounds (1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9), it is inferred that the function will be dealing with these integer values directly in its internal logic. However, there are no explicit parameters for the input. Without knowing the output or behavior of the function, we cannot detail any specific return values or case distinctions. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` remains undefined as it lacks parameters and output specification based on the provided data. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
