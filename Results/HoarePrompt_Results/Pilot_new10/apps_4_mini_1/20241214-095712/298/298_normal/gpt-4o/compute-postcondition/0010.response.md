The code snippet provided simply prints out a string '0 0' without affecting any of the integer variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. Since `print` does not alter the state of any variables, the output state remains the same except for the effect of the print command, which outputs '0 0'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), `area` is calculated as `n * m / k` (which is an integer), such that `area` is greater than 0; the output 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed.**
