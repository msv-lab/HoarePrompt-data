To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, we notice the following:

### Problem Description Summary
Vasya wants to find three integer points within specified bounds such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The points must satisfy:
- \( 0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n \)
- \( 0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m \)

If no such points exist, the output must be "NO". Otherwise, it should provide the coordinates of the points.

### Review of Functions and Output Hints

1. **Function `func_1`:** 
   - Computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - Output hints accurately describe this functionality.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - The output hints correctly explain the handling of a zero value in `b`, which isn't applicable here since the assumption is `b` is never zero. However, this does not affect the correctness for the given problem constraints.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - Calls `func_2` and returns a tuple with results and a specific derived value.
   - The output hints accurately convey the function's purpose; it facilitates the main logic without errors in expectations.

### Program Logic Evaluation
- The program starts by checking if \( n \times m \) is divisible by \( k \). If not, it prints "NO".
- It retrieves results from `func_3`, which seems to derive values necessary for forming the triangle's points based on the gcd properties.
- If the triangle area can be represented as required, the program attempts to construct three points which are printed if valid.

### Issue Identification
While evaluating the consistency with the problem statement, we note:
- The area of the triangle formula mentions that the points must be set in such a way that they conform to the triangle area condition given \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
- The program returns "YES" but only concludes that a valid triangle can be formed based purely on whether \( n \) and \( m \) can yield a valid gcd adjustment. There exists a possibility that the points derived from the logic may not satisfy the area requirement.
- The hints do not cover all edge cases that arise from \( k \) shaping the area calculation since it matters how the calculated area relates directly to layouts of the grid defined by `n` and `m`. 

### Conclusion
Given that there is a lack of confirmation that the coordinates' positions indeed create a triangle area that equals \( \frac{nm}{k} \) across all cases, including potential edge cases of \( n \) or \( m \) being very small while \( k \) is at its maximum, we determine that:

Correctness: **False** 

The program may not produce a valid triangle configuration satisfying the area requirement for all \( n, m, \) and \( k \) values provided, particularly given edge mathematical constraints. Therefore, there could be cases, such as \( n = 1, m = 1, k = 2 \), where the program responds "NO" despite the area condition possibly being satisfied mathematically but not geometrically represented by integer points.
