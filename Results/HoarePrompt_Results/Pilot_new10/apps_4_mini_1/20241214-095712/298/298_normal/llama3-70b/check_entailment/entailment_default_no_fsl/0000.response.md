Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the requirement states that it should find points that form a triangle with the given area, which is equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The key issue occurs when the calculated area \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not an integer; in such cases, no triangle can be formed with integer coordinates. 

For example, if \( n = 4 \), \( m = 4 \), and \( k = 7 \), the area would be \( \frac{16}{7} \), which is not an integer. The code checks if \( n \times m \mod k \neq 0 \) and prints "NO" if this condition is true, which is correct. 

However, even if the code prints "YES" when \( n \times m \) is divisible by \( k \), it does not verify whether valid integer points exist that can form a triangle with the specified area. It assumes that the points are always valid if the AREA condition is met, which is not necessarily true. For instance, if the computed coordinates for the points fall outside the specified bounds of \( 0 \leq x_i \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_i \leq m \), the triangle cannot be formed as required.

Thus, there is a gap in ensuring that the returned points actually lie within the required limits, making the program incorrect for certain inputs leading to out-of-bound points. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for every potential case.
