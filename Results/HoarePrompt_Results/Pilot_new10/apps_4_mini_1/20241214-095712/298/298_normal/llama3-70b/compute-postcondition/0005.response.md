The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with the condition that `b` is not equal to zero. In this function, if certain conditions are met, it can return different outputs. 

Specifically, if the program meets the condition outlined in Case_1, it returns the tuple (1, 0). In Case_2, it returns a tuple consisting of `y`, which is obtained from a recursive call to `func_2(b, a % b)`, and a second value calculated as `x - (a // b * y)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero) and return a tuple. If a specific condition occurs, it will return the tuple (1, 0); otherwise, it will return a tuple based on the results of a recursive calculation involving `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (where `b` is not equal to zero) and returns a tuple. If certain criteria are met, it returns (1, 0); otherwise, it returns a tuple calculated based on a recursive process involving `a` and `b`.**
