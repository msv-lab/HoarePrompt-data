You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and the loop executed as long as `b` was greater than 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of a and b, where b is 0, indicating that a remains unchanged as the loop was not executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially zero, the function will return `a` as the gcd immediately. The function utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcd, ensuring that the result reflects the correct mathematical definition of gcd for the provided inputs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b is not equal to zero.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns a tuple consisting of y (the second value returned by func_2(b, a % b)) and x - (a // b * y) which represents the calculation based on the provided integer values of a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint that `b` cannot be zero) and returns the tuple (1, 0) when `b` is zero, facilitating the base case for recursion. Otherwise, it computes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm by recursively calling itself with new values of `b` and `a % b`, ultimately returning a tuple consisting of the second value from this recursive call and the calculation `x - (a // b * y)`, which represents the coefficients for `a` and `b` that satisfy Bézout's identity. The provided function has the potential edge case of being called with `b` equal to zero; however, this case is not applicable due to the precondition stated in the comment.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns x and y, which are the outputs of the function `func_2(a, b)`, along with the result of the expression x * a + y * b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (both greater than or equal to 1), and returns a tuple containing the outputs from `func_2(a, b)` and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are the outputs of `func_2(a, b)`. It assumes that `func_2` is defined and returns two values. The functionality does not include any handling for possible exceptions that `func_2` might raise, which could occur if `func_2` does not behave as expected.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
