Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for finding three integer points that satisfy the constraints provided. Here are the issues that lead to this conclusion:

1. **Area Calculation**: The program checks if `n * m % k != 0` to decide if there's no possible configuration of points, which is correct in evaluating if the area can be an integer. However, this check alone is insufficient because the program does not guarantee that the points generated afterward will actually satisfy the area requirement \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

2. **Points Generation**: After confirming that the area can potentially be an integer, the program constructs points \( (0, 0) \), \( (0, n1 * m // g) \), and \( (m1 * m // g, 0) \) based on the output of `func_3`. However, there's no assurance that these points lie within the bounds defined by \( 0 \leq x_i \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_i \leq m \) as required.
    - For example, if \( n \) or \( m \) is small relative to the calculated point coordinates, the generated points could exceed these bounds, making it impossible to form a triangle without violating the constraints.

3. **Multiple Solutions**: The program does not consider whether multiple valid solutions exist or even check the geometry of the points to confirm that they form a triangle of the required area. 

To illustrate these points, consider an input like `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`. Despite passing the initial area check, the points generated might fall outside the allowable range, leading to a contradiction with the problem description.

In conclusion, the program fails to ensure that the generated points meet all specified constraints and requirements of outputting a valid triangle. Thus, it cannot be considered correct.
