You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to check if there are three integer points forming a triangle with a specific area. However, it contains logical errors that prevent it from achieving the desired behavior correctly.

### Analysis of the program:

1. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle is expected to be \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The first condition checks if \( nm \) is divisible by \( k \) to ensure that the area can be expressed as an integer. However, this alone doesn't guarantee that valid points can be found.

2. **Triangle Points Generation**: The implementation of points seems unclear. The function `func_3` is designed to return values used to potentially create triangle points, but the logic in the main part of the program may lead to incorrect points or no valid points at all. 

3. **Checking Conditions**: The condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` does not guarantee valid points within the bounds defined by \( n \) and \( m \). Specifically, it can lead to negative coordinates or coordinates outside the range specified by the problem.

### Potential Fail Case:
Consider the input:
```
n = 1
m = 1
k = 2
```
In this case, \( \frac{nm}{k} = \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer. The program should print "NO", however based on the constraint `if n * m % k:` it's more likely to lead to a situation where it may not evaluate points correctly.

Another case that illuminates the failure is larger values:
```
n = 10
m = 10
k = 3
```
Here \( \frac{nm}{k} \) results in \( \frac{100}{3} \), which is not integer. However, it may proceed erroneously without proper checks concluding with incorrectly generated points.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for generating valid points correctly, given the area conditions and bounds. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and the loop executed as long as `b` was greater than 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of a and b, where b is 0, indicating that a remains unchanged as the loop was not executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially zero, the function will return `a` as the gcd immediately. The function utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcd, ensuring that the result reflects the correct mathematical definition of gcd for the provided inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b is not equal to zero.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns a tuple consisting of y (the second value returned by func_2(b, a % b)) and x - (a // b * y) which represents the calculation based on the provided integer values of a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint that `b` cannot be zero) and returns the tuple (1, 0) when `b` is zero, facilitating the base case for recursion. Otherwise, it computes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm by recursively calling itself with new values of `b` and `a % b`, ultimately returning a tuple consisting of the second value from this recursive call and the calculation `x - (a // b * y)`, which represents the coefficients for `a` and `b` that satisfy Bézout's identity. The provided function has the potential edge case of being called with `b` equal to zero; however, this case is not applicable due to the precondition stated in the comment.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns x and y, which are the outputs of the function `func_2(a, b)`, along with the result of the expression x * a + y * b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (both greater than or equal to 1), and returns a tuple containing the outputs from `func_2(a, b)` and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are the outputs of `func_2(a, b)`. It assumes that `func_2` is defined and returns two values. The functionality does not include any handling for possible exceptions that `func_2` might raise, which could occur if `func_2` does not behave as expected.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
