The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers that are greater than or equal to 1. After executing the function body, it returns three values: the outputs `x` and `y` from the function `func_2(a, b)`, along with the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers, `a` and `b`, and return the outputs from `func_2(a, b)` along with a calculated result based on these outputs and the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, returns the outputs from func_2(a, b) and the result of the expression x * a + y * b.**
