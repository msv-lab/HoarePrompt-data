The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (both greater than or equal to 1), and returns a tuple containing the outputs from `func_2(a, b)` and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are the outputs of `func_2(a, b)`. It assumes that `func_2` is defined and returns two values. The functionality does not include any handling for possible exceptions that `func_2` might raise, which could occur if `func_2` does not behave as expected.
