The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers such that `a > 0` and `b > 0`, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` divides both `a` and `b`. The function returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by `func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the value returned from `func_1(a, b)`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both positive integers, and returns the product of a and b divided by func_1(a, b).**
