#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0. If `b` was initially greater than 0, the loop executed at least once, with `a` and `b` being updated to the earlier values as per the modulus operation. If `b` was initially 0, the loop wouldn't execute and `a` remains unchanged.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which remains unchanged as `b` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both greater than 0, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It correctly handles the case where `b` is initially greater than 0, ensuring that at least one iteration of the loop is executed. The function will always return the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b` after the loop terminates when `b` becomes 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 0, b > 0, and GCD(a, b) divides both a and b.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the product of a and b divided by func_1(a, b), where GCD(a, b) divides both a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, as computed by `func_1(a, b)`. This effectively calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. There are no checks for the validity of `a` and `b` within the function itself, but it assumes they are positive integers.
