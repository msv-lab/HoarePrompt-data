Given the initial state where `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is `a` modulo the previous value of `b` (which is greater than 0) and not a multiple of the previous value of `b`:

1. The expression `a, b = b, a % b` will assign the new values to `a` and `b`.
2. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
3. The new value of `b` becomes `a % b` using the initial values where `a` is the previous value of `b`.
4. Since `b` is not a multiple of the previous value of `b`, `a % b` will yield a value greater than 0.

The state of the variables can then be expressed:
- The new value of `a` is simply the previous value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` is the remainder when the old `a` (previous value of `b`) is divided by the old `b` (which is positive and not a divisor of `a`).

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is `a` modulo the previous value of `b` which is greater than 0 and not a multiple of the previous value of `b`.**
