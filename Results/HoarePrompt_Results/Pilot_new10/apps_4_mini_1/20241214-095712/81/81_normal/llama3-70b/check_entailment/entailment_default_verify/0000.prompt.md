You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program regarding the problem description, I will analyze the functionality of the program.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to find pairs of integers (a, b) such that:
- GCD(a, b) = x
- LCM(a, b) = y
- The integers a and b must lie within the range [l, r].
- Pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered distinct if a ≠ b.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program performs the following steps:
1. Takes four integers as input: l, r, x, y.
2. Initializes a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterates through all pairs (a, b) within the range [l, r].
4. Uses two helper functions:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the GCD of a and b.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Computes the LCM of a and b using the relationship between GCD and LCM.
5. If the GCD of (a, b) equals x and the LCM of (a, b) equals y, it increments the counter.
6. Prints the final count of valid pairs.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Validity of Pairs**: For a pair (a, b) to satisfy both GCD and LCM criteria, it must hold that:
   \[
   GCD(a, b) \cdot LCM(a, b) = a \cdot b
   \]
   Meaning:
   \[
   x \cdot y = a \cdot b
   \]
   If x and y do not satisfy the condition that y is a multiple of x (since LCM must be greater than or equal to GCD), no valid pairs would exist.

2. **Inefficient Loop**: The nested for loop checks a and b for their values in the range, leading to many unnecessary checks. It could potentially make the code inefficient especially with larger ranges (up to 10^9).

3. **Incorrect Counting**: The way the counting of pairs is done considers (a, b) and (b, a) distinctly but does not take into account if a = b which should only be counted once. 

4. **No Check for Validity**: The program lacks an initial check to see if x divides y (i.e., valid GCD and LCM relation). If not, it should early exit with 0 pairs.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
l = 1, r = 10, x = 2, y = 3
```
According to the rules, since GCD must divide LCM, this condition doesn't hold because 3 is not a multiple of 2. Therefore, no pairs (a, b) can exist that satisfy GCD(a, b) = 2 and LCM(a, b) = 3. The program would still enter the nested loop and unnecessarily compute values while it should directly return 0.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis above, the program fails to validate the input conditions properly and thus does not ensure correctness for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both greater than 0, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It correctly handles the case where `b` is initially greater than 0, ensuring that at least one iteration of the loop is executed. The function will always return the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b` after the loop terminates when `b` becomes 0. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, as computed by `func_1(a, b)`. This effectively calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. There are no checks for the validity of `a` and `b` within the function itself, but it assumes they are positive integers. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
