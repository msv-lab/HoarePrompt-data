The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers greater than 0. The function is designed to return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. It is important to note that the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged during the execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, both greater than 0, and return their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both greater than 0, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.**
