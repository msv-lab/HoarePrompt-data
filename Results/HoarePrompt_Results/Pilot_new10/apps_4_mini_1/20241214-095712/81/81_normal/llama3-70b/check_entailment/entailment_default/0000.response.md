To evaluate the correctness of the given program according to the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step, along with the provided functions and their hints.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that:
- The GCD of `(a, b)` is equal to `x`.
- The LCM of `(a, b)` is equal to `y`.
- Both `a` and `b` must be within the bounds of `l` and `r`.
- The pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are counted as distinct if `a` is not equal to `b`.

### Functions
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The output hint describes it correctly.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the LCM using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
   - The output hint accurately describes this function's purpose.

### Main Logic
We loop through all pairs `(a, b)` where `a` ranges from `l` to `r` and `b` ranges from `a` to `r`. The count increases if both the GCD is `x` and the LCM is `y`.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Checking Conditions**: 
   - The program only considers pairs where `a <= b`. Thus, pairs of the form `(b, a)` are counted when `a != b`, but it doesn't handle pairs like `(x, y)` where both may need to be checked independently.
2. **Divisibility Check**:
   - For pairs `(a, b)` to satisfy `GCD(a, b) = x` and `LCM(a, b) = y`, it is necessary that `y` must be divisible by `x` (`y % x == 0`). The program currently does not check this requirement before starting the evaluation of pairs.

### Example Analysis
- Consider input `(1, 2, 1, 2)`. 
  - Valid pairs: `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`, both giving `GCD = 1` and `LCM = 2`.
- Consider input `(1, 12, 1, 12)`. 
  - Valid pairs: `(1, 12)`, `(12, 1)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(4, 3)`, all satisfying the conditions.
- **Invalid Case**: For input `(50, 100, 3, 30)`, the pair `(3, 30)` has `GCD = 3` and `LCM = 30`, but neither 3 nor 30 lies within the range [50, 100]. Thus the output correctly shows `0`.

### Conclusion
The program fails to verify crucial constraints regarding the divisibility condition between `x` and `y`, which might lead to incorrect pair generation. Since the the logic does not consider this fundamental condition (i.e., `y % x == 0`), the program will yield incorrect results for many valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
