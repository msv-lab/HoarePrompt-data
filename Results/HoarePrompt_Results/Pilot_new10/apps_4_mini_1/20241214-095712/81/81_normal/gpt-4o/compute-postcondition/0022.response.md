Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` is an integer such that `x` ≤ `y`, `z` is an integer such that `z` ≥ 4, `count` is either 2 or 3 if `a` is equal to `b`, and 3 or 4 otherwise, `i` is 2, `a` is equal to `2 * x`, and `b` is equal to `(z // 2) * x`.***
