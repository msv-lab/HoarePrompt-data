Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l`, `r` is an integer such that `l` ≤ `r`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` is an integer such that `x` ≤ `y`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is now 1, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `z * x`. The value of `a` is within the range [l, r], the value of `b` is within the range [l, r], the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor is equal to `y`.***
