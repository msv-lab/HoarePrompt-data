Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l`, `r` is an integer such that `l` ≤ `r`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` is an integer such that `x` ≤ `y`, `z` is equal to `y // x` which is a positive integer, `count` is 0, int(math.sqrt(z)) must be at least 1, and `i` is now 1. The current value of `z` is divisible by `i`, meaning that `z % i == 0`.***
