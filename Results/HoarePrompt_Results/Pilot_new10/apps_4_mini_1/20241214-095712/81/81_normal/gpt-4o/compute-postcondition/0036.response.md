Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, and returns 0 if `y` is not divisible by `x`. If `y` is divisible by `x`, it computes the variable `z` as `y // x`, then counts the valid pairs `(a, b)` where both `a` and `b` are multiples of `x`, fall within the range `[l, r]`, satisfy the condition that their GCD is equal to `x`, and their product equals `y`. The function returns the total count of such valid pairs, including cases where `a` equals `b`.**
