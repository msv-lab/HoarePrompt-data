Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` is an integer such that `x` ≤ `y`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is now 1, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to `z * x`. If `l` ≤ `a` ≤ `r`, `l` ≤ `b` ≤ `r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, then if `a` is equal to `b`, `count` is set to 1 and the value of `a` is equal to the value of `b`; otherwise, if `a` is not equal to `b`, `count` is set to 2.***
