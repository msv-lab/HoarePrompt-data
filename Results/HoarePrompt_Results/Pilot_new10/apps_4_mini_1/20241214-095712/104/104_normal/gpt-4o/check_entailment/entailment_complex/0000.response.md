Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for the number of elements \( n \) and the subsequent strictly increasing integers. This matches the specifications where \( n \) is between 1 and 100 and the integers \( a_i \) are strictly increasing and within the range of 1 to 1000.

2. **Consecutive Elements Erasure Calculation**: The core logic of the program revolves around determining the gaps between consecutive elements in the array. It uses the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` to find the maximum number of elements that can be erased between each pair of consecutive elements. This calculation correctly captures the number of consecutive elements that could be removed since if the difference between consecutive elements is, for example, 3, it means that one can erase up to 1 element (for instance, the number 2).

3. **Handling the Edge Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the loop does not execute, and `max_erase` remains 0, which aligns with the problem description's directive that JATC cannot erase any elements if only one element exists.

4. **Output**: The program prints `max_erase`, which effectively is the maximum number of consecutive elements JATC can erase while still allowing for restoration of the array, as required by the problem description.

Due to these factors, the program fulfills all aspects of the problem statement, hence it is considered correct.
