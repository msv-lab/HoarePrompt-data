According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is currently 2, and `n`, which must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, meaning that it is the third iteration of the loop (counting from 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 (since the range goes from 1 to `n-1`).

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `max_erase` is updated to max(`max_erase`, `a[3] - a[2] - 1`)**
