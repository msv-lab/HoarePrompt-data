The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as input. Instead, it reads input consisting of an integer `n` that indicates the number of elements in the array, followed by `n` integers which represent a strictly increasing array. The output of the function is derived based on the array of integers provided as input. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to process a strictly increasing sequence of integers based on the specified conditions and constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes an input of an integer n followed by n strictly increasing integers and produces output based on this input.**
