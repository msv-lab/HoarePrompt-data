Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000), and calculates the length of the longest segment of contiguous elements in `a` such that each element in the segment has the same difference with its index as the first element. It prints the maximum length of segments found that satisfy this condition minus one. If no segments satisfying the condition exist, it will print 0. **
