According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs with `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, while `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. The next value of `j` will be 2, and for the loop to execute at least once more, `n` must be at least 2 (i.e., `n` must be greater than or equal to `j`, which is now 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
