Postcondition: ***`max_erase` is the maximum length of segments satisfying the condition found in `a`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `n` must be at least 5. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` is true, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2.***
