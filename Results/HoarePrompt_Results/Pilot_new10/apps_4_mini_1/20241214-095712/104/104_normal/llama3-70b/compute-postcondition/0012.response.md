`max_erase` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the result of `j - i - 1`. Here, `j` is 3 and `i` is 0. Therefore, `j - i - 1` equals `3 - 0 - 1`, which results in 2. Since the value of `max_erase` is not provided in the initial state, we denote it as `max_erase` before the operation. The output state updates to reflect that `max_erase` has potentially been changed based on its previous value and the calculated value of 2. The conditions that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is 3 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `max_erase` updated based on max(max_erase, 2)**
