According to the code, the loop will execute if the range defined by `i + 1` and `n + 1` produces at least one integer. Given that `i` is currently 1, the starting point for the range is \(1 + 1 = 2\). 

The loop executes when \(j\) takes values starting from 2 up to \(n + 1\). Therefore, for the loop to execute, \(n + 1\) must be greater than or equal to 2. Since \(n\) must be greater than 1, \(n\) must be at least 2 for this condition to hold. 

- `max_erase` does not influence the loop execution directly as it pertains to the loop body and not the condition for entry.
- At the start of the loop, `i` remains 1, and we determine the initial value of `j` will be 2 (the value it takes in the first iteration).

Therefore, the state can be represented as follows:

State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value found, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
