According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The variable `j` is initialized to `i + 1`, which is 3 in this case. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, which is at least 4. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which would make `j` equal to 5. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 5 (since the loop condition is `j <= n`).

State: **`max_erase` is the maximum length of segments satisfying the condition found in `a`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `n` must be at least 5**
