According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `j` is equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. In the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1; therefore, `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, which means `n` can remain within its range of 1 to 100, but must be greater than 1 to allow for the loop to continue past the first iteration.

State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value representing the longest consecutive segment found in the array `a` that satisfies the condition given, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 and n must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again**
