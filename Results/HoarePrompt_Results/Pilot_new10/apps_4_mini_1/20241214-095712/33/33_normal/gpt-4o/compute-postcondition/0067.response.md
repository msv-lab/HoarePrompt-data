The code snippet executes a print statement, which outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables `n`, `position`, and `valid` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `position` is within the range [0, 20000], `valid` is False, and 'NO' has been printed.**
