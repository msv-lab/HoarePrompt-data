The code `valid = False` assigns the value `False` to `valid`. The previous states of other variables do not change. Since `valid` was already `False`, there is no change in value. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer. If `dir` is 'North', `position` is either equal to the original `position` or `position - t` (only if `position - t` is non-negative), `valid` is False, and `t` is an input integer. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is either `t` or 20000 and `valid` remains False. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then `position` is either 0 or 20000 and `valid` remains False. `valid` is False.**
