Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `position` is 0, `valid` is False, `t` is 1, `dir` is an input value 2, and the current value of `dir` is 'North'. Since `position - t` is less than 0, it indicates that `position` is less than 1, which is consistent with the initial state of the program.***
