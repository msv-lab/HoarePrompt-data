The value of `valid` is explicitly set to `False`. Its previous value was also `False`, so there is no change in its state. The variables `n`, `t`, and `dir` are not affected by the code execution. Therefore, the Output State remains the same except that `valid` has been re-assigned the value `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `valid` is False, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string**
