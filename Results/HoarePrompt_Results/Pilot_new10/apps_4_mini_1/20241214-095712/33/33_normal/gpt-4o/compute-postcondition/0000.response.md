`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The range for `n` is given as 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, so it will take a positive integer value within that range when the program is executed. Other variables are not affected, so the output state remains valid with the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50)**.
