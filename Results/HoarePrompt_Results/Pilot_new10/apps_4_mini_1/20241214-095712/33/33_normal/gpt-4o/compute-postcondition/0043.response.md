Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `position` is out of bounds (either less than 0 or greater than 20000), then for `dir` being 'North', `position` may remain unchanged or decrease by `t` (if non-negative), and `valid` remains False. For `dir` being 'South', `position` may become `t` or remain 20000, with `valid` remaining False. For `dir` being 'West' or 'East', `position` is set to either 0 or 20000 and `valid` remains False. Thus, in all cases, `valid` remains False regardless of the direction.***
