The value of `position` is incremented by `t`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `position` can be either 0 or 20000, the new value of `position` will depend on the value of `t`. If `position` was 0 and `t` is positive, `position` will change to `t`. If `position` was 20000, the new value will be `20000 + t`, which will exceed 20000, keeping `valid` as False. Thus, `valid` remains False regardless of the scenario. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `position` is either `t` (if `position` was initially 0) or remains 20000 and `valid` remains False.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `position` is either `t` or 20000; `valid` remains False.**
