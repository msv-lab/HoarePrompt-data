The value of `position` is decremented by `t`. Given that `position - t` is stated to be less than 0, this implies that the new value of `position` will be negative after this operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `valid` remains False, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string, and `position` is now a negative value (equal to the previous `position` - `t`).**
