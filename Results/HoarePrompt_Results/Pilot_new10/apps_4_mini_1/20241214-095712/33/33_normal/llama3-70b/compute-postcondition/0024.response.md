The code `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program immediately without making any changes to the variable states. All variables retain their initial conditions. The output state reflects that 'NO' is printed but does not include any changes to the variables since the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` can be either 'North' or neither; `curr_lat` is equal to 90; 'NO' is printed.**
