Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, then `curr_lat` remains unchanged, the initial conditions remain valid, 'NO' is printed, and program execution has terminated.***
