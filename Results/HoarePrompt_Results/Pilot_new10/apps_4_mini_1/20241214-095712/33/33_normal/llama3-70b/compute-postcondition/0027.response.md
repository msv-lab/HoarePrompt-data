The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned values from the `input.split()` method. The `input` function will take user input, which will be split into two parts. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged as this operation does not affect it, but `t` and `dir` will hold the values inputted by the user. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` and `dir` are values from user input.**
