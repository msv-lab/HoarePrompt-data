The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the input value into an integer. As a result, `t` is now an integer, but the variable states of `n`, `curr_lat`, and `dir` remain unchanged. Therefore, all other variable conditions hold, while `t` is now specifically an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input value**
