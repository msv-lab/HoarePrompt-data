The execution of the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. In this case, no variables are directly affected by the execution of the `continue` statement. The other preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is not equal to 'South' and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop.**
