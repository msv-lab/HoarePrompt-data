The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and for `n` iterations expects an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6) and a direction (`dir`) which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". The function calculates a cumulative latitude based on `t` and the specified direction, modifying `curr_lat` accordingly. If during any modification, `curr_lat` exceeds the boundaries (-90 or 90) or does not meet specific conditions for reaching the poles, it prints 'NO' and terminates. After all iterations, it prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` equals 90, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function ignores any inputs with directions "West" or "East", which could lead to missing updates in latitude, and does not handle invalid inputs gracefully, which could raise an error if the input does not fit expected parameters.
