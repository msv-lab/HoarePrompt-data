The command `continue` serves to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. There are no changes to the values of `n`, `t`, or `dir` as a result of this command, but the code indicates that execution will move to the next iteration of the loop containing this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables while acknowledging that the loop will continue.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input; continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
