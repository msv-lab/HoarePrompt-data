The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned values based on user input. The specific values of `t` and `dir` will depend on the input provided by the user. The variable `n` remains unchanged as its initial condition still holds, and `curr_lat` also remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is a value from user input, `dir` is a value from user input, `curr_lat` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is a value from user input, `dir` is a value from user input, `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
