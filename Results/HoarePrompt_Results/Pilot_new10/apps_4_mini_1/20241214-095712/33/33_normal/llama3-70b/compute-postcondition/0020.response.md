The `exit()` command terminates the program execution immediately. None of the variables will be changed, and the program will stop running. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` can be either 'North', 'South', or neither; `curr_lat` is equal to -90; 'NO' has been printed; the program execution has been terminated.**
