The code provided does not change any variable values and simply prints a string 'NO'. The conditions regarding `curr_lat` and `dir` as described in the initial state remain unchanged and are still valid, since no updates or modifications occur as a result of executing the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; if `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', `curr_lat` remains unchanged and `dir` remains unchanged, and the program exits. If `curr_lat` is outside the boundaries of -90 to 90, the execution terminates and `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `curr_lat` may be updated based on the value of `dir` as previously defined; 'NO' is printed.**
