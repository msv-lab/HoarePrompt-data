The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program's execution. No variables are changed because the program simply exits without making any modifications. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged except for the execution having terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; if `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', `curr_lat` remains unchanged and `dir` remains unchanged, and the program exits. If `curr_lat` is outside the boundaries of -90 to 90, the execution terminates and `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `curr_lat` may be updated based on the value of `dir` as previously defined; 'NO' is printed, and the program execution has been terminated.**
