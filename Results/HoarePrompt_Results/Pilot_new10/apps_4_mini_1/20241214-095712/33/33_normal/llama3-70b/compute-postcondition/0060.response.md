Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is a value between -90 and 90, inclusive, representing the final latitude after all iterations. The loop has executed `n` times, modifying `curr_lat` based on the provided inputs for `t` and `dir`. If any conditions (such as exceeding latitude boundaries or invalid direction inputs) caused the program to terminate early, 'NO' would have been printed, and `curr_lat` would be unchanged from its previous state.**
