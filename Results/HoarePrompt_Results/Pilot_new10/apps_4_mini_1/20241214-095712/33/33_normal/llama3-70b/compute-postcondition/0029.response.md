The code increments `curr_lat` by `t / 111.195`. The initial variables `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged, but the value of `curr_lat` is updated based on the input value of `t`. Therefore, the value of `curr_lat` becomes the current value of `curr_lat` plus the fraction of `t` divided by 111.195.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`.**
