Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a value from user input, and `curr_lat` is unchanged; if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.***
