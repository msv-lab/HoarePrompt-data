Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and `t` is an integer. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged.***
