The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program execution stops without further processing. 

However, since the program is exiting, we can state that it has reached a termination point and no further operations are performed. Therefore, the output state indicates that the current variable states are still valid but we note the exit.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither; `curr_lat` remains either less than -90 or greater than 90; 'NO' is printed; the program exits.**
