According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, and it is essential to ensure that the loop can execute one more time based on the variable `_`, which acts as a counter but is not directly used in the loop body. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `n` as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If we have executed the loop `n` times already, `_` would have taken values from 0 to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current count of iterations (_), which means we need to adjust it to allow one more iteration.

If the loop has already iterated `n` times, we can conclude that it has reached its limit. Thus, to allow for one more execution, we need to ensure that `n` can support another iteration. Hence, `n` could be the same, as previously it allowed a full iteration equal to the provided bounds.

Since the information about `curr_lat` is primarily related to the termination conditions of the program, it does not directly influence the next state in terms of how many iterations are left, given that the for loop will iterate regardless of `curr_lat`.

Therefore, we have reached a scenario where no changes to `curr_lat` or `dir` affect the loop's iteration states but merely that the loop can execute all of its `n` iterations.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is an integer from user input, `dir` is a value from user input, `curr_lat` remains unchanged**
