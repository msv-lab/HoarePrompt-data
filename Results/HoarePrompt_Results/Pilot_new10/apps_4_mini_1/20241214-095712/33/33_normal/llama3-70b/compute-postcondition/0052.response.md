The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. No variables are modified, and the current state of the program ceases to exist beyond this point. Therefore, the program effectively ends without returning any values or altering any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` may be 'North', 'South', or something else; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; program execution has terminated.**
