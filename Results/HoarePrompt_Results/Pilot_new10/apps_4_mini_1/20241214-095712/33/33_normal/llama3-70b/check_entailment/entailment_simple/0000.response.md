To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the requirements stated in the problem description.

### Key Points from Problem Description:

1. **Movement Restrictions**:
   - While at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude), Limak can only move South.
   - While at the South Pole (-90 degrees latitude), Limak can only move North.

2. **Ending Position**:
   - The journey must end on the North Pole.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the North Pole. This is correct.

2. **Processing Movements**:
   - For each movement, it checks the direction and adjusts `curr_lat` accordingly:
     - If moving North, it increases `curr_lat`.
     - If moving South, it decreases `curr_lat`.
     - If moving West or East, it does not change `curr_lat`, which is valid since these directions do not affect latitude.

3. **Boundary and Direction Checks**:
   - The program checks if `curr_lat` is out of bounds (less than -90 or greater than 90). If so, it prints 'NO' and exits.
   - It checks if Limak is at the North Pole (90 degrees). If so, any movement other than South would be invalid, and it correctly prints 'NO'.
   - It similarly checks if Limak is at the South Pole and enforces the movement restriction (must move North).

4. **Final Check**:
   - After all movements, it checks if `curr_lat` is still at 90 (North Pole). If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:

The program implements all necessary checks for valid movements as described:
- It correctly handles the direction restrictions for both the North and South Poles.
- It ensures that Limak ends his journey at the North Pole.

### Therefore, based on this analysis:

Correctness: **True**
