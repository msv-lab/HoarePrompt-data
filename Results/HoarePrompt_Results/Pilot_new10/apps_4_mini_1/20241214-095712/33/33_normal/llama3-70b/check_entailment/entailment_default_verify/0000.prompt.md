You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the conditions and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem description:
1. Limak starts at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude).
2. He can only move South while at the North Pole.
3. He can only move North while at the South Pole.
4. The journey must end at the North Pole.

### Program analysis:
- The program reads the number of movements and for each movement, it adjusts Limak's latitude based on the direction and distance.
- If he moves North, it increases the latitude; if he moves South, it decreases it.
- It checks if the latitude falls out of the acceptable range (-90 to 90 degrees).
- If Limak tries to move North while at the South Pole or South while at the North Pole, it correctly identifies this as invalid.
- It ultimately checks whether he ends at the North Pole (90 degrees).

### Potential cases to test:
1. **Basic Movement**: Moves correctly according to the rules without breaking any conditions.
2. **Edge Case of Maximum Movement**: Attempting to move South directly from the North Pole should be validated.
3. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Moving East/West at the North or South Pole.
   - Ending at a latitude other than 90 degrees.

### Example Cases to check:

1. **Successful Journey**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     20000 South
     20000 North
     ```
   - Expected output: "NO" (ends at the North Pole but tries to move to South).
   - Actual output: The program will return "NO", which is correct.

2. **Invalid East Movement from North Pole**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     1000 East
     ```
   - Expected: "NO" (moving East at North Pole is invalid).
   - Actual output: The program would exit correctly with "NO".
   
3. **Correct Journey to South Pole then North**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     20000 South
     20000 North
     ```
   - Expected output: "NO" (can't move from the North Pole to the South Pole).
   - Actual output: The program will return "NO" correctly.

4. **Straight South then Invalid East**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     20000 South
     10000 East
     20000 North
     ```
   - Expected: "NO".
   - Actual output: The program will correctly check and return "NO".

5. **Valid East Movement Leading to Improper End**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     20000 South
     10000 East
     10000 South
     20000 North
     ```
   - Expected: "NO" (ends at latitude other than 90 degrees).
   - Actual output: The program would output "NO".

### Conclusion:
After examining various potential cases, the program adheres closely to the problem requirements and outputs correctly for all tested scenarios. It checks all necessary conditions at each step and ensures the final position is as required. However, the only edge case that is not addressed might be an improper handling of unused directions 'West' or 'East'. 

Final decision based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and for `n` iterations expects an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6) and a direction (`dir`) which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". The function calculates a cumulative latitude based on `t` and the specified direction, modifying `curr_lat` accordingly. If during any modification, `curr_lat` exceeds the boundaries (-90 or 90) or does not meet specific conditions for reaching the poles, it prints 'NO' and terminates. After all iterations, it prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` equals 90, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function ignores any inputs with directions "West" or "East", which could lead to missing updates in latitude, and does not handle invalid inputs gracefully, which could raise an error if the input does not fit expected parameters. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
