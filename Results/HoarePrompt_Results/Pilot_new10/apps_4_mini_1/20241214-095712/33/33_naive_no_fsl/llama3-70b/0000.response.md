Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw that does not correctly handle certain cases. 

One such case is when Limak is at the North Pole (latitude 90) and then moves 'East' or 'West'. According to the problem description, if Limak is at the North Pole, he should only be allowed to move 'South'. Instead, in the program, the 'East' and 'West' movements are ignored, but the check for `curr_lat` being `90` (North Pole) is not enforced correctly. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
2
1000 East
500 South
```
This input reflects an invalid movement since Limak starts at the North Pole and tries to go 'East'. The program will not catch this error because it only checks after updating `curr_lat` for North/South movements.

Furthermore, the logic, as written, continues processing directions even when an invalid direction is chosen, which leads to incorrect handling of the polar conditions laid out in the problem statement.

Therefore, there is a clear case where the program fails to meet the requirements, thus confirming it is incorrect.
