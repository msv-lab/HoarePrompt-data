`ans` is printed, but its value is not changed by the code snippet provided. Since it only outputs the value of `ans`, and does not modify any variables or states, the output state remains unchanged except for confirming that `ans` has been returned.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is the count of valid `i` values satisfying the loop condition for all iterations, `ans` has been returned**.
