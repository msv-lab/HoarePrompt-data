The variable `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`. The initial condition states that `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). However, since `input()` will provide an input value that is converted to an integer, the specific value of `n` changes to this new input integer. The other conditions remain valid; thus, we are uncertain of its new exact value, but we know it is now an integer defined by the current input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
