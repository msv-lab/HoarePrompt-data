max_9s is incremented by 1. The initial value of max_9s is 1, so after the execution of the code, the value of max_9s becomes 2. The state of variable n remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be equal to 9; `max_9s` is now 2. 

Output State: **`n` must be equal to 9; `max_9s` is now 2.**
