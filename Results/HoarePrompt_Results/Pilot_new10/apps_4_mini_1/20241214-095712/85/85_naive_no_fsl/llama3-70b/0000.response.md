Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for counting pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

The main issue lies in the condition used within the loop:
```python
if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
```
This condition is intended to check if the sum of the costs ends with a certain number of nines. However, it is not correctly determining the conditions required to find those pairs. Specifically, the check does not accurately reflect the requirement of counting pairs whose sum specifically ends with the highest number of nines, as it does not consider the possibility of both shovels being selected from any valid index.

An example input where the program fails is:
- For `n = 10`, the pairs (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), and (4, 6) indeed yield sums that end with one 9, but the correct answer is 4 such pairs, not what the program will output.

Due to these issues, the program does not accurately meet the requirements of the problem description.
