Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is the sum of the last segment of tickets that equaled `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the total number of segments whose sums equaled `target_sum`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, and `i` is 100 if the loop executed fully. Either `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1. If no segments were found, `current_sum` is the accumulated sum of all ticket values, and `segment_count` is 0.***
