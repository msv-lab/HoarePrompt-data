The variable `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 1. Therefore, after the increment, `segment_count` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2.**
