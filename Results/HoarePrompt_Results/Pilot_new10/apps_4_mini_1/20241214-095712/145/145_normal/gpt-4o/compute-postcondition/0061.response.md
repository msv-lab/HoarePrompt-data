The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `current_sum`, and `i` are unchanged except `i`, which has already been incremented by 1, but the exact new value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
