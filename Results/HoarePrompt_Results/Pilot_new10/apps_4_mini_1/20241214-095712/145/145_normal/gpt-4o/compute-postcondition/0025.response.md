The variable `target_sum` is assigned the result of calling the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`. Since `segment_length` is defined as 2, the function call becomes `segment_sum(0, 1)`. The previous values of `n`, `current_sum`, `segment_count`, `segment_length`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, we have a new value for `target_sum` but retain the rest of the initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is the sum of the last segment of tickets that equaled `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the total number of segments whose sums equaled `target_sum`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, and `i` is 100 if the loop executed fully.**
