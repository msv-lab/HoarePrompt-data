The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `segment_count` becomes its previous value plus 1. The values of `n`, `current_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The output state indicates that `segment_count` has been updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1, `i` is equal to its previous value incremented by 1 and is less than `n`.**
