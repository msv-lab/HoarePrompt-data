The variable `current_sum` is updated by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]` to it. The value of `i` is currently 2, and `ticket[i]` will yield some integer value. Hence, after executing the code, `current_sum` will now hold the value of its previous value plus `int(ticket[2])`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is updated to be its previous value plus `int(ticket[2])`.**
