The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `0 + int(ticket[0])`, which meant it was derived from the first element of the `ticket` array. However, after running the code, `current_sum` is now just `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`, `i` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, and the current value of `current_sum` has been reset to 0.**
