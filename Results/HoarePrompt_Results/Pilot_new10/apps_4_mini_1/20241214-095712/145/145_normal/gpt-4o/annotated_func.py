def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is the last accumulated sum of ticket values that did not equal to the last `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of segments whose sums equaled their respective `target_sum`, `segment_length` is `n-1`, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, n-2)`, and `i` is `n`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 100 inclusive and a string `ticket` containing `n` digits. It attempts to partition the ticket into segments where each segment's sum matches a predefined target sum derived from the segment length. If at least one valid partitioning with more than one segment is found, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function relies on the `segment_sum` function, which must be properly defined for the code to work accurately, but any potential issues with non-integer checks or sums not being correctly validated in the inner loops are not explicitly handled in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits, start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < len(ticket).
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the integers represented by the substring of 'ticket' from index 'start' to 'end', inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of digits `ticket`, along with two non-negative integers `start` and `end` that indicate the indices of the substring in `ticket`. It then calculates and returns the sum of the integers represented by the substring from `start` to `end`, inclusive. It is assumed that `start` and `end` are within valid bounds based on `ticket`'s length, as indicated by the precondition.
