The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100 inclusive, while `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, where each digit is between 0 and 9. After executing the function body, the possible return values are as follows:

- Case_1: The function returns 'YES', indicating that a valid segment has been found as `segment_count` is greater than 1, and `target_sum` corresponds to the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`.
- Case_2: The function returns 'YES', indicating that there is at least one segment whose sum equals the target sum, with `segment_count` greater than 1.
- Case_3: The function returns 'YES', indicating that a valid condition or state was met based on the segment conditions provided.
- Case_4: The function returns 'NO'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a string `ticket` (of `n` digits), and based on specific conditions regarding segments and their sums, the function returns 'YES' or 'NO'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 100 inclusive and a string `ticket` of `n` digits. It returns 'YES' if certain segment conditions are met or 'NO' otherwise.**
