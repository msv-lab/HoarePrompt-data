You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the logic it implements and check if there are any potential cases where it might fail.

### Problem Description Recap:
A ticket is considered lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: It correctly reads the number of digits `n` and the ticket string.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates over possible segment lengths (from 1 to `n-1`).
   - For each segment length, it calculates the segment's sum using `segment_sum`.
   - It tries to iterate through the ticket and accumulate a current sum to check if it matches the target segment sum.
   - If it finds a match, it resets the current sum and increments the segment count.
   - At the end of checking if the segments can form, it checks if the last sum is 0 and that more than 1 segment was found to label the ticket as lucky.

### Potential Case to Test:
Let's consider a specific example to test whether the program works as expected:
- **Example Ticket**: `111111` (This ticket can be split into six segments of `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1` each having an equal sum of `1`.)
- The expected output is "YES".

### Execution:
- For segment length `1`, the function will find `6` segments of `1` each.
- Hence, it would count `segment_count` as `6`, which is greater than `1`, and would return "YES".

### Edge Case:
- We need to test the edge cases to ensure the function is robust. For instance:
- **Test Ticket**: `00` (This ticket can only be split into `0` and `0`, hence both sides are equal.)
- The expected output is "YES".

### Conclusion:
After checking the logic in various cases including edge cases:
1. **Ticket `73452`** results in "YES".
2. **Ticket `1248`** results in "NO".
3. **Ticket `111111`** results in "YES".
4. **Ticket `00`** results in "YES".

I have been unable to find a specific input for which the program fails to provide the correct output based on the described logic.

Therefore, my final verdict on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly identifies whether the ticket is lucky according to the problem requirements.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and ticket is a string of n digits where each digit is between 0 and 9.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is the last accumulated sum of ticket values that did not equal to the last `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of segments whose sums equaled their respective `target_sum`, `segment_length` is `n-1`, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, n-2)`, and `i` is `n`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits, start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < len(ticket).
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the integers represented by the substring of 'ticket' from index 'start' to 'end', inclusive.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
