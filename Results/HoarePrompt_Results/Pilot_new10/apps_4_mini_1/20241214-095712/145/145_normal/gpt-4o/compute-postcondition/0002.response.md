Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of digits `ticket`, along with two non-negative integers `start` and `end` that indicate the indices of the substring in `ticket`. It then calculates and returns the sum of the integers represented by the substring from `start` to `end`, inclusive. It is assumed that `start` and `end` are within valid bounds based on `ticket`'s length, as indicated by the precondition. **
