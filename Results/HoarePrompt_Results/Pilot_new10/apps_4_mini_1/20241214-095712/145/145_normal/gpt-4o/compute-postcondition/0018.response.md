The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is not provided, so it is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, and `segment_count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased by 1.**
