The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of 0. The previous value of `current_sum` was `int(ticket[1])`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and `segment_count` is increased to 1.
