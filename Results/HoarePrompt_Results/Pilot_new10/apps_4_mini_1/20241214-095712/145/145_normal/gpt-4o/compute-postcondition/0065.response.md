The value of `current_sum` is reassigned to 0. `current_sum`'s previous value was equal to `int(ticket[i])`, which was likely a non-zero integer. The other variable states remain valid, with `n` still being between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `segment_count` having been incremented by 1, alongside `i` being incremented by 1 and still being less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 1, `i` is equal to its previous value incremented by 1 and is less than `n`.**
