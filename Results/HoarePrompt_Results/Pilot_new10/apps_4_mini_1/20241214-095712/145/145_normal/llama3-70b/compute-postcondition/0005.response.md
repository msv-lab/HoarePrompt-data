`curr_sum` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables, `ticket`, `total_sum`, and `target_sum`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is between 0 and 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is an even number; `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`; `curr_sum` is 0.
