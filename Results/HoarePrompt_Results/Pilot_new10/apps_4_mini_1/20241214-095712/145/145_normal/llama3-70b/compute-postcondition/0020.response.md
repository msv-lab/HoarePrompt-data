The value of `segments` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `segments` is unknown, and the other values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is an even number formed by the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is equal to `target_sum + digit`, `segments` is increased by 1 while `curr_sum` remains unchanged, and `digit` will be the next digit in `ticket`.
