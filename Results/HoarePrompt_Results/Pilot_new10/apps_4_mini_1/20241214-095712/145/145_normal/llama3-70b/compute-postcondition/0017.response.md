Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is an even number formed by the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and if `curr_sum` is equal to `target_sum` (which indicates that the current segment meets the target sum), `segments` is increased by 1 while `curr_sum` remains unchanged.***
