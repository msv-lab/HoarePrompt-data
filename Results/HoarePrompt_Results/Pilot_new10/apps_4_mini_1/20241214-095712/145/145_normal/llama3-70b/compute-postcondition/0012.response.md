Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is an even number formed by the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and if `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0 and `segments` is 1. Otherwise, `curr_sum` remains unchanged, and `segments` is not affected as there is no else part.***
