The value of `segments` is incremented by 1. The other variables retain their previous values since they are not affected by this operation. Thus, `curr_sum` remains equal to `target_sum`, `total_sum` is still an even number formed by the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and the value of `ticket` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is an even number formed by the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` remains equal to `target_sum`, `segments` is 1**.
