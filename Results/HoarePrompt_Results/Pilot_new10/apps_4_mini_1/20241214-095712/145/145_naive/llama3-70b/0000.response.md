To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we can analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and how it processes the input ticket.

Key points from the problem description:
1. A lucky ticket must be split into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.
2. The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` digits as a sequence.

Analyzing the program:
1. It first checks if the total sum of the digits is odd. If so, it returns `False`, which is correct since an odd total cannot be split evenly.
2. If the total sum is even, it calculates the target sum (half of the total).
3. As it iterates through the digits, it maintains a `curr_sum` to accumulate the digits and counts how many segments equal the `target_sum` it can form.
4. Finally, it checks if the count of segments is at least 2 to determine if the ticket is lucky.

Now let's examine potential edge cases and scenarios where this function might fail:

1. **Minimum Case (n=2)**: Consider the input where `n = 2` and the digits are `1 1`. Here, the total sum is `2`, which is even, and the `target_sum` is `1`. The function will find `curr_sum` equal to `1` after processing the first digit and will count one segment. It will then check the second digit but reach the end without forming two segments. This should return "NO" but would return "YES" due to counting the last segment. Therefore, it incorrectly indicates that the ticket is lucky.

Given this counterexample, we can conclude that the program does not always adhere to the problem description because it fails for the case of two equal segments of minimum length.

Correctness: **False**.
