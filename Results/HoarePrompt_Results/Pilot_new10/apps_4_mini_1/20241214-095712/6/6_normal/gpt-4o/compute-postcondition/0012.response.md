To calculate `close_both_sides`, we need to evaluate the expression provided while taking into account the definitions of all relevant variables.

Given:
- `move_to_l` is the absolute value of `pos - l`, which evaluates to `abs(pos - l)`
- `move_to_r` is the absolute value of `pos - r`, which evaluates to `abs(pos - r)`
- `r - l + 2` is a constant added to the calculations

The formula is:
```
close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
```

Thus, in the output state:
- `close_both_sides` holds the minimum of the two expressions calculated using the updated values of `move_to_l` and `move_to_r`.

No other variables have changed; thus, we retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs; `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position; `l` is an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open; `r` is an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`.**
