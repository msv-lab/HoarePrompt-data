The value of `move_to_l` is assigned to be the absolute difference between the `pos` and `l`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of tabs; `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position; `l` is an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open; `r` is an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open, and `move_to_l` is the absolute value of `pos - l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs; `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position; `l` is an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open; `r` is an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open; `move_to_l` is the absolute value of `pos - l`.**
