The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are assigned based on input values which are provided in a single line, where each value corresponds to the variables as defined. The values of these variables will now be specific integers as per the input while maintaining the conditions given: `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`, `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. Therefore, the states of other variables will not be affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs, `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position, `l` is an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open, `r` is an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open (all values are set based on input while adhering to their defined ranges).**
