Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `r` is equal to `n`, the output is the value of `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is calculated as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is calculated as `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, with `close_both_sides` being printed.***
