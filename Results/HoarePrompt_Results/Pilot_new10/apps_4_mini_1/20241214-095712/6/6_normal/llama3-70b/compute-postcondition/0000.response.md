The code assigns new values to `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` by taking input from the user and mapping it to integers. Since the values of these variables are dependent on user input but must respect the previously defined constraints (1 <= pos <= n and 1 <= l <= r <= n), we can specify them as inputs that satisfy these conditions. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 <= pos <= n, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= n; new values for `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers.**
