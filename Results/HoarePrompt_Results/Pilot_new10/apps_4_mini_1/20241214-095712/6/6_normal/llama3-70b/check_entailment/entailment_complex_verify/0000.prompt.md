You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to consider various scenarios of how Luba can close the tabs.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Luba has `n` tabs indexed from `1` to `n`.
   - The cursor is at the position `pos`.
   - She needs to leave only tabs in the range `[l, r]` open.
   - The function should return the minimum time (in seconds) to close all other tabs.

2. **Evaluate the Provided Code**:
```python
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)
```

3. **Code Explanation**:
   - The code captures the number of tabs `n`, the current position `pos`, and the range `[l, r]`.
   - The `if` statements check whether Luba's current position is outside the range `[l, r]`. If `pos` is less than `l`, it calculates how far she needs to move to `l` to start closing on the left side and adds that to `ans`.
   - If `pos` is greater than `r`, it calculates how far to move to `r` to start closing on the right side.
   - Finally, it adds the minimum time to move to either end (`pos - 1` or `n - r`) and the maximum time to move from the beginning to `l - 1`.

4. **Potential Issue**:
   Considering corner cases, let's evaluate:

   - For input `6 3 2 4`, the program computes:
     - Move to `2`: `1 second`
     - Close left: `1 second`
     - Move to `3`: `0 seconds`
     - Move to `4`: `1 second`
     - Close right: `1 second`
     - **Total: 5 seconds** (Correct).

   - For input `6 3 1 3`, the program computes:
     - Move to `1`: `2 seconds` (not needed)
     - Close left: `1 second`
     - **Total: 1 second** (Correct).

   - For input `5 2 1 5`, the program computes:
     - No moves necessary, since everything is within range.
     - **Total: 0 seconds** (Correct).

5. **Find an Edge Case**:
   Let’s test edge cases:
   - For input `5 3 5 5`:
     - The cursor starts at `3` and needs to move to `5`.
     - The tab range is `[5, 5]`, meaning Luba needs to close all to the left.
     - Expected: Move to `5`, close left. Should compute `3 -> 4 (1 second), 4 -> 5 (1 second)` then close.
     - **The program would output a total here that might not account for each possible movement required**.

6. **Verify Logic & Conclusion**:
   Since the algorithm attempts to find certain critical positions but does not account for when `l` and `r` both head towards the same tab while already away from `p`, it may miscalculate the closure and movement for edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.  
(Note: The exact computations in edge cases, particularly when `pos` is within the boundary limits `[l, r]` need to be recalibrated, as shown in tests.)

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer such that 1 <= pos <= n, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if (pos < l) :
        ans += l - pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` is equal to `l - pos`. If `pos` is greater than or equal to `l`, `ans` remains 0.
    if (pos > r) :
        ans += pos - r
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100. If `pos` is greater than `r` and less than `l`, then `ans` is equal to `l - pos + (pos - r)`; if `pos` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `ans` remains 0.
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` via user input, where `n` is between 1 and 100, `pos` is between 1 and `n`, and `l` and `r` are such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`. It calculates a value `ans` based on the position of `pos` relative to `l` and `r`, updating `ans` based on specific conditions. It then prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the total distance or adjustments needed to fit the `pos` within the boundaries defined by `l` and `r`, considering also how far `pos` is from the start and end limits of the range. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
