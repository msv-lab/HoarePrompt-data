The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100. The parameter `pos` is also an integer, constrained by the condition that it must be between 1 and `n` inclusive. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers where `l` must be at least 1 and `r` must be at most `n`, with the additional condition that `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. The function's output is not specified in the provided details. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as accepting these four integer parameters with the specified constraints but not detailing the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r with specified integer constraints, but does not provide an output specification.**
