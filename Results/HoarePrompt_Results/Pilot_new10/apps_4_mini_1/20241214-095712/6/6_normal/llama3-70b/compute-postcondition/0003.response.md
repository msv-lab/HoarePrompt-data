The value of `ans` is incremented by the difference between `l` and `pos`. Since the current value of `pos` is less than `l`, the result will be a positive integer, specifically `ans` will now equal `l - pos`, while all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `pos` < `l` <= `n`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `ans` is equal to `l - pos`**
