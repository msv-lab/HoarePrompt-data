The operation `current = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost (or first) element from the `queue` and assigns it to the variable `current`. The `queue` is a structure that must contain at least one unique state prior to this operation, which means that after executing this line, `queue` will still contain unique states, but with one less state than before. Since `start` and `visited` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` includes all unique states created during the swapping process; `queue` has one less unique state and `current` is assigned the leftmost state from `queue`.**
