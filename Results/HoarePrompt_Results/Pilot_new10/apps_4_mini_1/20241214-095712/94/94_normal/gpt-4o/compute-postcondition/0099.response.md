`visited` is updated by adding `new_state_str` to it. The values of `start`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `queue`, `current`, `new_pos`, and `new_state` remain unchanged, as the operation only modifies the `visited` set.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and `queue` must have at least one unique state; `current` remains the leftmost state from `queue`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` has the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
