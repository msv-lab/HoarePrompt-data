According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `queue`. If `queue` is empty, the loop cannot execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is indicated that if no valid moves were possible, `queue` would remain empty. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must contain at least one unique state.

Since no specific modifications to `start`, `visited`, or `current` have been detailed, we will assume that these states do not need changes. The adjustment necessary is simply to ensure that `queue` contains at least one state, implying that at least one valid move must have been processed to add a new state.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` is a set containing all unique states created during the swapping process, including `start`; `queue` must contain at least one unique state**
