Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `queue` now includes `new_state_str`, `directions` has at least one more pair to process, and `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is created by joining the characters of `new_state`.***
