The code executes a command to add `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. Since the value of `new_state_str` is already defined in the initial state, this operation does not affect the values of any other variables. The variable `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, but no other variables have changed. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to the `visited` set only.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is updated with swapped elements; `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
