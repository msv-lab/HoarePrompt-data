Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; if `new_row` is between 0 and 1 inclusive and `new_col` is also between 0 and 1 inclusive, `new_state_str` is added to `visited` if it was not already present, and it is also added to `queue`. The variables `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are updated accordingly, ensuring that `queue` still has at least one unique state and `current` remains the leftmost state from `queue`. If the conditions for `new_row` and `new_col` are not met, there is no change to the state.***
