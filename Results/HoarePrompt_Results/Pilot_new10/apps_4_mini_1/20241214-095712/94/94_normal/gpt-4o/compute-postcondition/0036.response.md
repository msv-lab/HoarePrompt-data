In the provided code snippet, the operation `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The operation has no impact on other variables but updates the `queue` with a new element.

Since `new_state_str` is formed from the current state and has been swapped into a new configuration, its value is the result of that swap. The rest of the variables remain unchanged based on the preconditions stated.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `(dr, dc)` has been processed; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is the list created from `current`, with elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`; `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`; `queue` now contains `new_state_str`.**
