The `new_pos` variable is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` depend on the variables `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`, but those values have not been defined in the initial state. The structure of `new_row` and `new_col` remains as given (`new_row = empty_row + dr` and `new_col = empty_col + dc`).

Therefore, in our output state, `new_pos` will reflect its calculation based on the expressions for `new_row` and `new_col`, but we cannot define its exact outcome without specific values for `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`. The other states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.**
