The variables `new_row` and `new_col` are being assigned the values `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. The values of `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc` are not directly given in the initial state, but `directions` indicates that there is at least one remaining pair of values to process for them. As such, without specific values for `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`, we cannot determine exact values for `new_row` and `new_col`. However, the output state will reflect that `new_row` and `new_col` will be calculated based on these expressions.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`**.
