Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` is a set of all unique states created during the swapping process; `queue` has at least one unique state; `current` is the leftmost state from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_pos // 2 + dr) * 2 + (empty_pos % 2 + dc)`; `directions` has at least one direction; `new_state` reflects the swap of characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the characters in `new_state`. The `new_state_str` is not in the `visited` set.***
