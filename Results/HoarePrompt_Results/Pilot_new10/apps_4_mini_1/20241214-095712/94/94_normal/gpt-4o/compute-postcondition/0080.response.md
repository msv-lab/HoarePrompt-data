Given the initial state and the provided code:

Initial State: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` includes all unique states created during the swapping process; `queue` has one less unique state; `current` is assigned the leftmost state from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.

The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` calculates the row and column of the empty position (the position of 'X') based on its index. The `divmod` function will divide `empty_pos` by 2, giving the quotient as `empty_row` (which represents the row index in a 2x2 grid) and the remainder as `empty_col` (which represents the column index).

1. The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` will be computed based on `empty_pos`.
2. The original state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will explicitly include the calculated values for `empty_row` and `empty_col` but will not specify their numerical values because `empty_pos` isn't explicitly defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` includes all unique states created during the swapping process; `queue` has one less unique state; `current` is assigned the leftmost state from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.**
