The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` are updated based on the values of `dr` and `dc`. The new values of `new_row` and `new_col` depend on the addition of these directional offsets to the previous `empty_row` and `empty_col`. Since no specific values for `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` have been provided, the output state will reflect the changes as follows:

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`.**
