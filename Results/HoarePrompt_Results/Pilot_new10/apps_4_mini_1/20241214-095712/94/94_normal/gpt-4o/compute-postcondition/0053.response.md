Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` contains the previous states plus `new_state_str`; `queue` contains at least 3 unique states (including `new_state_str`); `current` is the first element in `queue`; `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is valid; `new_col` is valid; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is the list containing the swapped elements of `current`; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`; `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`, and `queue` now has the additional element `new_state_str`.**
