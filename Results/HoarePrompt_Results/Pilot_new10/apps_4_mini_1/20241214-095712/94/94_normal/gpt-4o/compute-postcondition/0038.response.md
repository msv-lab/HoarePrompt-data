Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `directions` contains at least one more element; after processing `(dr, dc)`, if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_state_str` is added to `visited`, and `queue` now contains `new_state_str`.***
