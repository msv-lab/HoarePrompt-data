The impact of the code assigns values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the operations involving `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, or `dc`, so we cannot determine the exact values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Since we are not given values for `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`, the output will represent that `new_row` and `new_col` are determined by the addition of `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`.**
