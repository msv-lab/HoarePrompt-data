The code assigns new values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the direction tuples `dr` and `dc`. The variable `dr` and `dc` are dependent on the current iteration in the loop but do not have specific values given in this context. Since `empty_row` can be either 0 or 1 and `empty_col` can also be either 0 or 1, `new_row` and `new_col` will be calculated accordingly as combinations of these values with those from `directions`.

The possible values for `new_row` and `new_col` based on the direction pairs are:
- If `dr` = -1, `new_row` will be `empty_row - 1`
- If `dr` = 1, `new_row` will be `empty_row + 1`
- If `dc` = -1, `new_col` will be `empty_col - 1`
- If `dc` = 1, `new_col` will be `empty_col + 1`

Thus, considering the above, the state for `new_row` and `new_col` can be described based on these calculations, while the other variables remain unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'; `queue` is deque([]); `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'start'; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is either 0 or 1; `empty_col` is either 0 or 1; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`.**
