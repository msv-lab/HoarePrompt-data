Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, it is added to `visited`, and `new_state_str` is added to `queue`, which still has at least one unique state. `current` remains the leftmost state from `queue`; variables `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are updated accordingly, and `directions` has at least one direction.***
