To simulate the execution of the given code snippet:

Initial State: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `visited` remains unchanged; `queue` contains at least 3 unique states including `new_state_str`; `directions` has at least one more pair to process; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is a list representation of `current`.

The line of code:
```
new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos]
```
exchanges the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list.

Step by step assessment:

1. `new_state[empty_pos]` gets the value that is in the position `empty_pos` of the list `new_state`.
2. `new_state[new_pos]` gets the value that is in the position `new_pos` of the list `new_state`.
3. The swap operation takes place which means after the execution:
   - `new_state[empty_pos]` will now hold the value originally at `new_pos`.
   - `new_state[new_pos]` will now hold the value originally at `empty_pos`.

Important to note that the values of `new_row`, `new_col`, `visited`, and `queue` remain unchanged, and `new_state` is modified accordingly based on the values of `new_pos` and `empty_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `visited` remains unchanged; `queue` contains at least 3 unique states including `new_state_str`; `directions` has at least one more pair to process; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` has the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
