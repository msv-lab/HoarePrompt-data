The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` takes the list `new_state` and joins its elements into a single string `new_state_str`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `new_state` is derived from the characters of `current` post-swap, `new_state_str` represents the new configuration of the string after the swap.

Output State: **`start` is the updated string after swapping characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `queue` is deque([]); `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'start'; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is either 0 or 1; `empty_col` is either 0 or 1; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is the list of characters from `current` post-swap; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining elements of `new_state`.**
