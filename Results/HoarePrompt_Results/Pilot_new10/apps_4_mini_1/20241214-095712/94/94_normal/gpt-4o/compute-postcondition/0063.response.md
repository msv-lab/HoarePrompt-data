The `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str` by appending it to the existing list of states contained in `queue`. The other variables (`start`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `visited`, `directions`, `new_pos`, `new_state_str`) remain unchanged since they are not directly modified by the `append` operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str` along with at least the 3 unique states it already had; `directions` has at least one more pair to process; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is created by joining the characters of `new_state`.
