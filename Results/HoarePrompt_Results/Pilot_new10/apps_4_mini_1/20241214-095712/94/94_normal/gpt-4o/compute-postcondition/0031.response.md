The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The value for `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. Therefore, `new_pos` becomes `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.

The previous values of `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc` are not specified, thus they remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `new_pos` is calculated based on those variables.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `(dr, dc)` has been processed; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**.
