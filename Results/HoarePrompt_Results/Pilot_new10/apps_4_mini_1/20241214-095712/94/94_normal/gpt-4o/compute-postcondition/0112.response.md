Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` contains at least one more element; if `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), then `new_pos` is calculated as `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is formed by joining the elements of `new_state`; if `new_state_str` is not already present in `visited`, then it is added to `visited`, and `new_state_str` is also added to `queue`.***
