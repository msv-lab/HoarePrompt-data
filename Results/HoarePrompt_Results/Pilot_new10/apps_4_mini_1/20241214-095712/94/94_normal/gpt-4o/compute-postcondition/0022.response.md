The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which will create a new list from the contents of `current`. The value of `current` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot ascertain its contents. However, the states of other variables remain unchanged. The output state thus reflects the unchanged conditions along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc); `new_state` is a list created from `current`.**
