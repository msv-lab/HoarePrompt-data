The variable `queue` is affected by the code as it receives a new element, `new_state_str`, which has been derived from the current state of the program. The initial value of `visited` has been updated to include `new_state_str` as well. The other variablesâ€™ states remain as previously described.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.**
