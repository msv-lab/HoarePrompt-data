The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which converts the list `new_state` into a string by concatenating its elements. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Since `new_state` has already swapped the elements at the specified indices, `new_state_str` will be the string representation of that updated list. We assume the presence of valid values for `new_state`, given the prior manipulations, but we do not know the exact string it results in, as `new_state` depends on other variables.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is updated with swapped elements, and `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`.**
