#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings consisting of two lines, each containing two characters where each character is either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', with exactly one 'X' in each puzzle indicating the empty cell.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings of two lines with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`; `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns False because the sorted characters of 'AABX' are not equal to the sorted characters of 'CCBB'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two strings `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each consisting of four characters ('A', 'B', 'C', and 'X') where 'X' represents an empty cell. It finds the indices of 'X' in both strings, swaps the characters at those positions, and returns `True` if the sorted characters of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` (after the swap) are equal; otherwise, it returns `False`. If the strings do not conform to the expected format (e.g., not containing exactly one 'X' each or having incorrect lengths), the function may not behave as intended, but this is not explicitly handled in the code.
