In the code, the characters at the specified indices `x1` in `puzzle1` and `x2` in `puzzle2` are swapped. Therefore, the values of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` change at the respective indices, while all other information remains valid. 

Assuming the following prior state:
- `puzzle1` = "AABX"
- `puzzle2` = "CCXBB"
- `x1` = 3 (the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`)
- `x2` = 2 (the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`)

The output state will reflect the character swap:
- `puzzle1` becomes "AABX" with 'X' (at index 3) swapped with 'X' from `puzzle2` (index 2), so it results in "AABX".
- `puzzle2` becomes "CCXBB" with 'X' (at index 2) swapped with 'X' from `puzzle1` (index 3), so it results in "CCBB".

Output State: **`puzzle1` is "AABX", `puzzle2` is "CCBB", `x1` is 3, `x2` is 2**.
