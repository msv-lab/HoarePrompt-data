In the provided initial state:

- `puzzle1` is a string of two lines with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `puzzle2` is a string of two lines with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `i` is 0.
- The value of `puzzle1[i]` is checked to potentially set `x1` to 0 if it is 'X', and `puzzle2[i]` is also checked to see if it is 'X'.

Now, executing the code:

```
x2 = i
```

The variable `x2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables (`puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, `x1`) remain unaffected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `puzzle1` is a string of two lines with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `puzzle2` is a string of two lines with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `i` is 0.
- `x2` is 0.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a string of two lines with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `puzzle2` is a string of two lines with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `i` is 0; `x2` is 0**.
