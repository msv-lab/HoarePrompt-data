The function accepts two strings `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each consisting of four characters ('A', 'B', 'C', and 'X') where 'X' represents an empty cell. It finds the indices of 'X' in both strings, swaps the characters at those positions, and returns `True` if the sorted characters of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` (after the swap) are equal; otherwise, it returns `False`. If the strings do not conform to the expected format (e.g., not containing exactly one 'X' each or having incorrect lengths), the function may not behave as intended, but this is not explicitly handled in the code.
