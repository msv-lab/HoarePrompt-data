Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic within the `func_1` function incorrectly simplifies the problem by merely checking if the two strings can be made equal by swapping the 'X' characters (representing empty cells) and then comparing the sorted strings. This approach does not account for the actual sliding moves allowed in solving the puzzles.

For example, consider the following scenario:

**Input:**
```
AX
BC
```
**Puzzle 1 (Bessie):** 
```
A X
B C
```
**Puzzle 2 (Elsie):** 
```
A B
C X
```

In this case, even though Bessie and Elsie's puzzles appear to be similar (with the same tiles), the possible moves to transition from one state to another aren't considered. The 'X' must actually move into the adjacent tile to change the configuration, and simply swapping the tiles at 'X' locations does not reflect the allowed operations for reaching all potential configurations. 

Thus, given this flaw, the output for this example would incorrectly return "YES" when the two configurations cannot be made identical based on legal moves. Therefore, since the code does not correctly handle every edge case as defined in the problem description, the correctness is evaluated as **False**.
