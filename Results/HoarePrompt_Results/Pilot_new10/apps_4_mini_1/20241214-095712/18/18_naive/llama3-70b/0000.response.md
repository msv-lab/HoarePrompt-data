To assess the correctness of the provided program in accordance with the problem description regarding the Mexican wave, we need to carefully consider how the spectators stand and sit based on the time `t`.

Given the input parameters:
- `n`: total number of spectators
- `k`: number of spectators that can stand simultaneously
- `t`: time at which we want to know how many spectators are standing

**Key Points from Problem Description:**
1. From time `1` to `k`, the number of spectators standing is simply `t` (1 to k).
2. From time `k + 1` to `n + k`, the number of standing spectators is constant at `k`.
3. From time `n + 1` to `n + k`, the standing spectators decrease back to `0` (from `k` to `1` to `0`).

Now let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

### Analysis of the Program Logic:
1. **For `t` in the range `[1, k]`:**
   - It correctly outputs `t`, as `min(t, k)` will just return `t` in this case.
   
2. **For `t` in the range `[k + 1, n + k]`:**
   - It correctly outputs `k`, as `t` will be greater than `n`, so the condition `t <= n` will be false, and `k - (t - n) % k` will equal `k`. This is the constant period when exactly `k` spectators are standing.

3. **For `t` in the range `[n + 1, n + k]`:**
   - Here the logic becomes crucial to evaluate. 
   - The expression `k - (t - n) % k` should result in the correct number of spectators standing in this range. 
   - As `t` increases beyond `n`, it counts down from `k` to `0` correctly due to the use of the modulo operation.

### Edge Case to Consider:
- For `t = n + k`, the program computes `k - (t - n) % k` which simplifies to `k - k % k = k`. This is expected since this is the final state before transitioning to all seated.

### Findings:
Based on my analysis, it appears that the function handles all cases correctly as described in the problem statement.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly identifies the number of standing spectators at any time `t`. It adheres to the specifications given in the problem.

Correctness: **True**.
