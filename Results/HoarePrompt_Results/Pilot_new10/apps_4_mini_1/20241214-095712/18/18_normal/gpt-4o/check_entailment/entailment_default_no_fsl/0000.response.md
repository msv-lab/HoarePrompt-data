Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. For example, when `t` exceeds `n + k`, the output is calculated using the formula `n + k - t`, which can yield a negative value if `t` is sufficiently large. However, in the context of the problem, the number of spectators standing cannot be negative.

To illustrate, consider an input case like `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 16`. According to the output logic, the formula would yield `10 + 5 - 16 = -1`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem as it should return zero spectators standing, not a negative value.

Therefore, since there are potential inputs that lead to incorrect outputs, the correctness of the program is false.
