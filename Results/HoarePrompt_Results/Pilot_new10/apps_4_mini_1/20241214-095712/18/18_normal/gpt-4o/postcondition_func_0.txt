The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. It outputs the following: If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`. If `t` is greater than `n`, it prints `n + k - t`. Notably, the output of `n + k - t` can potentially be a negative value if `t` is sufficiently large, which isn't addressed in the annotations.
