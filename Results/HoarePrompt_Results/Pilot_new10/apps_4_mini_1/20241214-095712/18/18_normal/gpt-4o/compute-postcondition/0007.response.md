To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state, let's consider the given initial values:

- `n` is assigned a value `n'`
- `k` is assigned a value `k'`
- `t` is assigned a value `t'`
- Constraints: \( 1 \leq n' \leq 10^9 \), \( 1 \leq k' \leq n' \), \( 1 \leq t' < n' + k' \)
- Additionally, it is stated that \( t > k \) and \( t > n \).

Now, the code executes the statement:
```python
print(n + k - t)
```

This statement computes the result of \( n + k - t \) and prints it. 

Given the initial state:
- The value of \( n + k - t \) can be directly computed as follows:
  \[
  n + k - t = n' + k' - t'
  \]
- Since \( t \) is greater than both \( n \) and \( k \), we know that:
  \[
  t' > n' \quad \text{and} \quad t' > k'
  \]
- Therefore, \( n' + k' - t' \) will result in a negative value.

The output state after executing the print statement will reflect the final calculated value of \( n + k - t \), while the other variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned a value `n'`, `k` is assigned a value `k'`, `t` is assigned a value `t'`, and the printed value is `n' + k' - t'` (a negative value).**
