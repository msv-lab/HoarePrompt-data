The given code computes a value based on the current values of `n`, `k`, and `t`. The evaluated expression consists of two cases:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is `min(t, k)`.
2. If `t` is greater than `n`, the output is `k - (t - n) % k`.

The initial conditions provide constraints for `n`, `k`, and `t`.

The output of the expression will depend on whether `t` is less than or equal to `n` or not, and will result in a single computed value, which can be treated as the value of the output state.

Based on the logic provided, the output state will reflect these computed conditions without changing the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k; the output is min(t, k) if t ≤ n or k - (t - n) % k if t > n**.
