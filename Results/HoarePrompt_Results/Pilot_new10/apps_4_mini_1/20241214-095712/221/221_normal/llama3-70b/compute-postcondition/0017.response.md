The function `func` does not directly accept any parameters in its signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `s` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{12}\). 

Since there are no output conditions provided in the output description, we cannot specify any specific return values or behavior. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be fully described.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints that s is a positive integer (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12) and x is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12). The return behavior is unspecified.**
