The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b` XOR `x`. Since `x` is a non-negative integer and within the range, the operation will yield a specific value depending on `b`. The values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged at their limits provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of `s` and `x`, and it will also include `a` which is now determined by the operation involving `b` and `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a positive integer such that 2 <= s <= 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^12, `a` is equal to `b ^ x`.**
