Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that a + b = s and a ^ b = x. 

The current implementation does not compute the values of a and b based on the given sum s and XOR x; instead, it tries to derive them incorrectly using bitwise operations without focusing on the problem requirements. 

For example, if we take the input `s = 9` and `x = 5`, the correct logic involves the following steps:

1. Verify whether x is greater than s. If so, there are no valid pairs since XOR cannot exceed the sum.
2. Calculate two values: `a + b = s` and `a ^ b = x`. From these, derive the conditions for (a, b).
3. The derivation shows that (s - x) must be non-negative and even for valid (a, b) pairs.

However, the function as written does not perform these checks and computations, making it incorrect according to the requirements of the problem description. 

As an example, the input `s = 9` and `x = 5` should yield 4 valid pairs (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2), but the provided program does not approach the problem correctly to produce this result.
