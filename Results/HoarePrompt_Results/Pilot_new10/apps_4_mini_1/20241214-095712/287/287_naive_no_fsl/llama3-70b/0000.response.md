Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as defined. The task is to count the different weights of splits for a given integer \(n\). However, the program is counting the number of divisors of \(n\) instead of counting the possible weights of splits. The logic implemented is only concerned with finding the divisors, which does not align with the requirements given in the problem description. 

For example, if we test the program with \(n = 8\):
- The expected output (the different weights of its splits) is \(5\).
- However, the program would not calculate this correctly since it only counts the divisors of \(n\).

Thus, the program does not meet the specifications for the problem, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
