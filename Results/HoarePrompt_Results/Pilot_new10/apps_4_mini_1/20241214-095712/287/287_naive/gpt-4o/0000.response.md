To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the given code.

### Problem Description Review

We need to find the number of different weights of the splits of an integer \( n \). The weights of a split are defined based on how many times the first element of the split appears in that split.

### Program Analysis

The program has the following code structure:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count
```

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1(num)` is calculating the number of divisors of the input `num`, rather than the different weights of splits. The weights of splits are derived from the decomposition of the number into nonincreasing sequences, and this program does not reflect that.

2. **Lack of Proper Checks**: The program does not ensure that it is generating valid "splits" that conform to the rules provided in the problem description. It just counts divisors, which is unrelated to the task of finding weights from splits of the number.

3. **Concrete Example**:
   - For \( n = 7 \):
     - Expected output based on the split weights: 4 (the weights should be [1, 2, 3, 7] based on possible valid splits).
     - The program will return 4, but this is purely coincidental since it operates under the wrong premise of counting divisors.

Therefore, since the logic does not align with the requirements laid out in the problem statement, the program does not accomplish the task as specified.

### Conclusion

Given these points, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not solve the problem it is meant to address, as it counts divisors instead of identifying the different weights of the splits.
