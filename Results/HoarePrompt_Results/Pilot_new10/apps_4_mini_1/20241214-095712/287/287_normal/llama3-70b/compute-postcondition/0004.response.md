`res` is incremented by 2. The values of `n` and `i` do not change. Other states of the variables remain valid, and `n` is still an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is still 1, and `n` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`n` is any integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` is divisible by `i`, and `res` is increased by 2.**
