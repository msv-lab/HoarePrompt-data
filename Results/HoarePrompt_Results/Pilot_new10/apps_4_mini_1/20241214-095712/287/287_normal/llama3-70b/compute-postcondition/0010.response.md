`res` is incremented by 2, but it remains unchanged only if `2 * 2` does not equal `n`. Since `2 * 2` equals 4, `res` will only be updated if `n` is not equal to 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state distinguishes between two scenarios: if `n` = 4, `res` remains unchanged; if `n` ≠ 4, `res` is `res + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `i` is 2; `res` is either unchanged if `n` = 4 or `res + 2` if `n` ≠ 4.**
