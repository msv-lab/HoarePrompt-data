The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9. The previous state of `res` is modified, but we do not have enough information to specify its exact value after the decrement. The conditions regarding `n` being even or odd do not change with this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `res` is decreased by 1**
