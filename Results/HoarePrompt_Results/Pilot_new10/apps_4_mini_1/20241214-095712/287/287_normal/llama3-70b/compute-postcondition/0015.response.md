In the given code snippet, the variable `res` is incremented by 2. Since `i` is calculated as `int(n)`, `i` takes the integer value of `n`. However, `i` is not modified by the provided code.

The states of the other variables, notably `n`, remain unchanged. The only effect is on `res`, which is increased by 2. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is int(n), and `res` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is int(n), and `res` is increased by 2**.
