Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to count the number of divisors of the integer \( n \). However, the problem description requires calculating the number of different weights of splits of \( n \), not the number of its divisors.

To illustrate this, let us consider the case when \( n = 8 \):
- The possible weights of splits for \( 8 \) are \( 1 \) (from split \([8]\)), \( 2 \) (for split \([4, 4]\)), \( 3 \) (for split \([2, 2, 2, 2]\)), \( 4 \) (from \([2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\)), and \( 5 \) (from splits containing \( 1's \)). Hence, there are \( 5 \) different weights as per the problem statement.
- On the other hand, the program will output \( 4 \) for \( n = 8 \), as it counts the total number of divisors \( 8 \) has (which are \( 1, 2, 4, 8 \)), missing the requirement specified in the problem description.

Since the program does not fulfill the requirements of calculating the number of different weights based on the splits, it is incorrect. Thus, we conclude that the program's implementation does not work as expected for the specified problem.
