The variable `count` is incremented by 1, while the previous state indicates that `num` must be greater than or equal to (i + 1)^2. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` grows by 1, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (i + 1)^2, `i` has been incremented by 1, `count` has been increased by 1.**
