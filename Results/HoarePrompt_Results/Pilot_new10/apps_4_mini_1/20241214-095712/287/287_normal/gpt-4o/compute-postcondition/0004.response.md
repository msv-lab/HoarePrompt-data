The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after the execution, `count` will be 1. The values of the other variables, `num` and `i`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i**.
