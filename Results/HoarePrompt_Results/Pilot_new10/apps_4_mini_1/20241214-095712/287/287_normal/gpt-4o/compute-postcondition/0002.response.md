According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `i * i <= num`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be such that when squared, it is less than or equal to `num`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which means `i * i` equals 1. Given that `num` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, the loop can execute as long as `num` is 1 or greater.

Since `num` is already a positive integer and its value can be anything from 1 to 10^9, no adjustments are needed to `num`. The current values of `count` and `i` do not affect the ability of the loop to run since `i` will evaluate to 1 in the first iteration.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
