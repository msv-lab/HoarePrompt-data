The provided Python program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Explanation:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The function needs to find the number of different weights of splits for a given positive integer \( n \).
   - Splits must be nonincreasing sequences of positive integers that sum to \( n \).
   - The weight of a split is the number of times the first element (which is the largest element in the split) appears in that split.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program calculates the total number of divisors of the integer \( n \) instead of finding the number of different weights of its splits.
   - It uses a loop to count how many integers can divide \( n \) without leaving a remainder, which is unrelated to the task of counting weights of splits.

### Example Failure:
- For \( n = 8 \):
  - The expected output is 5, because there are five different weights of its splits: [8], [4, 4], [3, 3, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
  - However, when the provided program is executed, it will compute the number of divisors of 8 (which is 4) instead, since the divisors of 8 are [1, 2, 4, 8].

Given this discrepancy, it is clear that the program does not solve the problem as required.

**Correctness: False**
