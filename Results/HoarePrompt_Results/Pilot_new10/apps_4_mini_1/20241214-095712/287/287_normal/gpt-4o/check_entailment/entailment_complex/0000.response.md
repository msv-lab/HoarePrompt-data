Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements equal to the first element in that split.

However, the program defined by the function `func_1` merely computes the total number of divisors of the integer \( n \). It does not consider the formation of splits or how weights of splits correlate with the value of \( n \).

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the input \( n = 8 \). The expected output, based on the problem description, is 5 (which signifies the different weights of possible splits of 8). However, the program incorrectly outputs the number of divisors of 8, which is 4 (the divisors being 1, 2, 4, and 8).

Therefore, the function does not fulfill the problem's requirements, doing something entirely different.
