The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of an integer \( n \), while the implemented function calculates the total number of divisors of \( n \).

The code defines `func_1(num)` to count divisors:
```python
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count
```

This code counts how many integers can divide \( n \) without a remainder, which is unrelated to finding the "weights of the splits." 

Output hints indicate that the function returns the total number of divisors of `num`, which confirms that the logic implemented does not align with the problem requirements.

To illustrate a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

- For \( n = 7 \), the expected output based on the problem is 4 (indicating the weights corresponding to the valid splits) but the output produced by the current function will compute that 7 has 2 divisors (1 and 7).

Therefore, the implementation does not address the requirements of the problem statement, thus making it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
