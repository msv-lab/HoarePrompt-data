Initial State: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9 and `count` is 0. If `num` is divisible by `i`, and if `i` is not equal to `num // i`, then `count` is set to 2 and `i` remains as 1. If `i` equals `num // i`, the program does not change `count` or `i`. Otherwise, if `num` is not divisible by `i`, there are no changes to `count` or `i`.

```
i += 1
```

Now, we evaluate the impact of the code on the program:

1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
2. The values of `count` and `num` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, after the execution of the code, we are left with the following state:

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
