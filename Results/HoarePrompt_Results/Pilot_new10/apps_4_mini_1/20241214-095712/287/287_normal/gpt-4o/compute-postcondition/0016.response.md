According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num`. The loop will execute as long as \(i^2\) is less than or equal to `num`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `num` is greater than or equal to \(i^2\) or larger than or equal to the square of the incremented value of `i` (i.e., \((i+1)^2\)). Since `i` has already been incremented by 1, we now need to check the conditions again:

1. If `num` must sustain the condition for the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`): for the loop to execute one more time, it must be that \(i^2 \leq num\).
2. Since `num` is currently greater than or equal to \((i + 1)^2\), this suggests it is necessary to set `num` to be at least greater than or equal to \((i + 1)^2\).

However, to ensure the loop will execute again, `num` needs to be adjusted such that it is at least \((i + 1)^2\) to meet the loop's condition.

State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (i + 1)^2, `i` is incremented by 1**
