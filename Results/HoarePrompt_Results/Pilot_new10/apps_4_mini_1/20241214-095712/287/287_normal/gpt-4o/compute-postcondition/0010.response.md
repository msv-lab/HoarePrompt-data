To determine whether the `while` loop can run again, we need to analyze the condition `i * i <= num`. Currently, we have the values:

- `num` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq num \leq 10^9 \)
- `count` is 0
- `i` has been incremented by 1, so the current value of `i` is \( i_{previous} + 1 \) where \( i_{previous} \) was the value of `i` before the increment.

For the loop to execute once more, the condition \( i * i \) must still be less than or equal to `num`. This implies:

- The square of the current value of `i` (which is \( (i_{previous} + 1)^2 \)) needs to be less than or equal to `num`.

If we denote \( x = i_{previous} \), we have:

\[
(i_{previous} + 1)^2 \leq num
\]

To ensure this condition holds after incrementing `i`, we can express the necessary condition for `num`:

\[
num \ge (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]

Currently, we know that `num` is simply a positive integer between 1 and \( 10^9 \), and we don't have a specific value for \( num \). Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to strengthen the condition on `num`. 

Since `i` has just been incremented, for the loop to still execute one more time, `num` must be at least:

State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (current i)^2 or num must be larger than or equal to the square of the incremented value of i**
