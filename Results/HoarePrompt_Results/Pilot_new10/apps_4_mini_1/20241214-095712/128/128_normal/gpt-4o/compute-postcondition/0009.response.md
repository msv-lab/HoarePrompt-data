The line of code `regular_sales.append(min(k, l))` affects the program by appending the minimum of the values referenced by `k` and `l` to the list `regular_sales`. The variables `k` and `l` refer to specific tuples in the `days` list, and since `n` is greater than 0, it implies that there are at least 2 tuples available to reference. 

1. The original values of `k` and `l` are not provided, but they reference some elements within the tuples in the `days` list.
2. The output will state that `regular_sales` has been updated to include the minimum value of `k` and `l`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `f` is a non-negative integer; `days` is a list of tuples with at least `n + 2` tuples; `k` and `l` reference the next tuple in `days`; `regular_sales` now includes the minimum value of `k` and `l`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `f` is a non-negative integer; `days` is a list of tuples with at least `n + 2` tuples; `k` and `l` reference the next tuple in `days`; `regular_sales` is updated to include `min(k, l)`.**
