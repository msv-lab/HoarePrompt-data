The variable `potential_sales_increase` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the values of other variables, which remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `f`, `days`, and `regular_sales` retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list of n tuples each containing two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i), `regular_sales` is an empty list, and `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list.**
