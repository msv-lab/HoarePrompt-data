The operation `days.append((k, l))` adds a new tuple `(k, l)` to the list `days`. The values of `k` and `l` are based on user input; however, their specific values are unknown at this moment. The other variables such as `n`, `f`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is now a list containing the tuple `(k, l)` added to the previous contents of `days`, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.**
