Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is sorted in descending order, `_` is `n - 1`, and `sold` is updated to `0 + min(days[0][0] * 2, days[0][1]) + min(days[1][0] * 2, days[1][1])` if `i` is less than `f`. Otherwise, `sold` is updated to `0 + min(days[0][0] * 2, days[0][1]) + min(days[1][0], days[1][1])`, and `i` is 1 in both cases.***
