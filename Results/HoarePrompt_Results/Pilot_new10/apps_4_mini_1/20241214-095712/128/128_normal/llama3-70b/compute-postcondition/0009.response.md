The tuple `(k, l)` is assigned values based on user input split into two integers by the `map(int, input().split())` function. The previous state indicates that `k` and `l` will now hold these newly inputted integer values.

The values of `n`, `f`, `days`, and `_` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list with the previous contents plus the tuple `(k, l)`, `_` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.**
