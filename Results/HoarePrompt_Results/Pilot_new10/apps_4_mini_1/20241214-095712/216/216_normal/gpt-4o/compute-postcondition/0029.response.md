The `current_set.clear()` function call removes all items from the `current_set`. Assuming `current_set` contained lowercase letters before the execution, after calling this function, it will be empty. The other variables are not affected, and their states remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 2 or 0, and `max_count` is either 1 or 2, and there is at least one character left in `s`.**
