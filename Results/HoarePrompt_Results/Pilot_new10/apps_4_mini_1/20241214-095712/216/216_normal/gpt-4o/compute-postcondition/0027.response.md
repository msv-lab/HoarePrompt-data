Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` now includes all previously processed lowercase letters plus `char`, `current_count` is either 3 or 1, and `max_count` is either 0 or 1, with at least one character left in `s`.***
