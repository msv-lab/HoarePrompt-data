You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the logic in the program correctly identifies the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in a "pretty" set.

The key requirements from the problem description are:
1. The letters in the set must be distinct and lowercase.
2. There must not be any uppercase letters separating the indices of the letters in the set.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the given program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
```

### Step-by-Step Logic Flow:

1. Read the integer `n` and the string `s`.
2. Initialize `max_count` to track the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in segments of the string.
3. Create a `current_set` to keep track of unique lowercase letters in the current segment.
4. Traverse each character in the string:
   - If the character is lowercase and not in `current_set`, add it and increment `current_count`.
   - If the character is uppercase, update `max_count` with `current_count`, clear the `current_set`, and reset `current_count` to zero (indicating the end of a current segment of lowercase letters).
5. After finishing the loop, ensure the last segment's count is considered by comparing it to `max_count`.
6. Print the maximum count found.

### Testing Edge Cases

1. **All uppercase letters**:
   - Input: `3\nABC\n`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Actual Output: `0` (correct)
   
2. **Only lowercase letters** (e.g., `aaaa`):
   - Input: `4\naaaa\n`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (correct)
   
3. **Multiple segments of distinct lowercase letters**:
   - Input: `11\naaaaBaabAbA\n`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Actual Output: `2` (correct)
   
4. **Contiguous lowercase letters mixed with uppercase**:
   - Input: `12\nzACaAbbaazzC\n`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Actual Output: `3` (correct)

5. **Forming barriers of uppercase letters**:
   - Input: `7\nabCdeFg\n`
   - Expected Output: `5` (positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are valid)
   - Actual Output: The output for this case should also yield `5`, and since it is processed in segments, the code will correctly count it.

### Conclusion

In all plausible edge cases, the code produces the correct outputs corresponding to the problem description. It handles uppercase letters correctly by resetting the current tracking variables and ensures uniqueness among lowercase letters.

Therefore, based on our evaluation:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program successfully adheres to all requirements of the problem and handles the conditions specified for determining "pretty" sets accurately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of string s, and s is a string consisting only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is the input string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is the maximum count of unique lowercase letters found in any segment of `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0 if the last character was uppercase, or the number of unique lowercase letters in the final segment of `s` if the last character was lowercase.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
