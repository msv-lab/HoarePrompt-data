To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The input consists of:
   - An integer `n` representing the length of string `s`.
   - A string `s` composed of both uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.
   
2. The output should be the maximum number of unique lowercase letters in the contiguous segments of the string that are free of uppercase letters.

### Program Logic:
1. Read input values of `n` and `s`.
2. Initialize `max_count` to keep track of the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters found in segments.
3. Initialize `current_set` to keep track of the unique lowercase letters in the current segment being analyzed.
4. Initialize `current_count` to keep track of the number of unique lowercase letters in the current segment.
5. Iterate through each character of the string:
   - If the character is lowercase:
     - Check if it's already in `current_set`. If not, add it and increment the `current_count`.
   - If the character is uppercase:
     - Compare `current_count` with `max_count`, update if necessary, clear `current_set`, and reset `current_count`.
6. After the loop, compare one last time in case the string ends with lowercase letters and no upper case letter follows it.
7. Print `max_count`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Distinct Lowercase Letters**: The program correctly uses a set to track distinct lowercase characters.
2. **Contiguous Segments**: The program correctly identifies segments separated by uppercase letters. It resets when an uppercase letter is found, thereby preventing incorrect counts from letters in different segments.
3. **Final Comparison**: After the loop, it correctly checks if the last segment contains any unique letters that should update the `max_count`.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- All characters are uppercase: Should return `0` (handled correctly).
- All characters are lowercase: Should return `n` (handled correctly).
- Mixed cases with varying counts of letters: Will return the maximum count segment (handled by the logic).

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the behavior described in the problem, handling distinct lowercase letters and correctly accounting for segments delimited by uppercase letters.

Thus, the program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
