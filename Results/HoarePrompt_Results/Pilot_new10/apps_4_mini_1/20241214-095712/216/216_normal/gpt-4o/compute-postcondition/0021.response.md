The `current_set.clear()` method removes all elements from `current_set`, which means that it will be empty after execution. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 1, `max_count` is either 0 or 1.**
