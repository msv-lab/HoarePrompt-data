The `current_set` variable is an empty set initially, and the operation `current_set.clear()` is called. The `clear` method removes all elements from the set. Since `current_set` is already empty, it remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is still an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and `char` is an uppercase letter.**
