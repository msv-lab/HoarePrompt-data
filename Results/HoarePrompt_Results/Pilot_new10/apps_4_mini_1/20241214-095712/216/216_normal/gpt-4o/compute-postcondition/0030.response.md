The value of `current_count` is set to 0, which directly changes its previous state. The rest of the variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of characters, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` is either 1 or 2, and there is at least one character left in `s`.
