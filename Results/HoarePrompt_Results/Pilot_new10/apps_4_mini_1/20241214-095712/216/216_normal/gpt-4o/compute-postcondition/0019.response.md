Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `current_set` includes `char` along with previously included characters, and `current_count` is incremented to 2, while `max_count` remains 0 when the loop executes again. If `char` was already in `current_set`, the state of `current_set`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remains unchanged.***
