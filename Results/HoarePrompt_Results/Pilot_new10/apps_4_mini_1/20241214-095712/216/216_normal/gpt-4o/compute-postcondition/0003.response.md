The variable `current_set` is assigned an empty set. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `max_count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is an input string consisting only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is 0, and `current_set` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is an input string consisting only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set.**
