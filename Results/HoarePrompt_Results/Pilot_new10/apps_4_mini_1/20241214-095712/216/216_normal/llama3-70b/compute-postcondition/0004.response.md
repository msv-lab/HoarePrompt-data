The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. The parameter `s` is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, and its length must be equal to `n`. The output of the function is not explicitly described, so we need to infer its behavior based on the input constraints. 

However, without additional output conditions provided, we cannot specify the exact return value in this case. Hence, we can only state the constraints and the parameters accepted.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` (consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length equal to `n`).**
