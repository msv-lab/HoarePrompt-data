Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The function's purpose is to find the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters that can be chosen from the string `s` such that no uppercase letters are situated between the chosen positions. However, the code only counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string, disregarding the necessity of ensuring these lowercase letters are distinct and properly separated by uppercase letters.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
aAaAb
```

The expected output should be `1`, because the only valid lowercase letter is 'a', and it occurs in positions that are separated by uppercase letters. However, the program would output `3`, counting all lowercase 'a's and 'b's without considering the uppercase constraints.

Thus, the program fails to provide the correct maximum count for every potential case, demonstrating its incorrectness.
