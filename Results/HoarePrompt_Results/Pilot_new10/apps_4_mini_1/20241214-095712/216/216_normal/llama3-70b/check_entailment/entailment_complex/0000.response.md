Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Understanding of "Pretty Set"**: The problem requires the identification of positions of distinct lowercase letters that are not separated by uppercase letters. The program only counts the lowercase letters without considering their uniqueness or the presence of uppercase letters between their positions.

2. **Ignoring Uppercase Letters**: The program does not handle or exclude positions based on the presence of uppercase letters, which is a key requirement stated in the problem. It merely creates a list of indices of lowercase letters and counts them, failing to check if any uppercase letters are situated between those indices.

3. **Failure to Count Distinct Letters**: The program also overlooks the need to count only distinct lowercase letters. It counts all lowercase letters, including duplicates.

As an example to illustrate the problem:
For the input `11` and the string `aaaaBaabAbA`, the expected output is `2` (positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8), but the program would incorrectly output `4` (counting all positions of `a`).

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem description properly, leading to an incorrect result.
