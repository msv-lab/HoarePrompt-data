In the provided code snippet, the `script` list has a new entry appended to it that is formatted as `f'move {file} {i}'`. Here, `file` corresponds to the third element in the `examples` list, which has at least 3 elements, and `i` is currently 3.

The impact of the code on the program is as follows:
- The `script` variable, which previously contained the strings 'move {file} 1' and 'move {file} 2', will now include an additional string `move {file} 3`, where `{file}` will be the value of the third element in `examples`.

Thus, after executing the code, the state of the affected variables is updated as follows:
- `script` will now include three entries, the new one being `f'move {file} 3'`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state details the relevant information, reflecting the updated `script`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` has at least 3 elements, `script` contains the strings 'move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2', and 'move {file} 3' where `file` is the third element in `examples`, `i` is 3**.
