According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer with valid values ranging from 1 to 100,000, and it needs to be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. The loop will iteratively execute a number of times equal to the value of `n`. 

By the end of the last iteration, the loop index does not need to be modified since it is represented by `_`, which is a throwaway variable.

To summarize, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1, and since `files` is an empty list and does not change based on the loop's execution, its state remains as is.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `files` is an empty list**
