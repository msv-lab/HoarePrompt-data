The function accepts a positive integer `n` followed by `n` lines of distinct filenames paired with a type indicator (0 or 1), where 1 indicates an example test and 0 indicates a regular test. It sorts the filenames primarily by their type (with example tests appearing first) and generates a sequence of move commands, formatted as "move {filename} {i}", where {i} is the order of the filename after sorting. It prints the total number of commands generated and each command in order. If there are no example tests provided, only regular tests will be processed and added to the commands. The function does not return any value.
