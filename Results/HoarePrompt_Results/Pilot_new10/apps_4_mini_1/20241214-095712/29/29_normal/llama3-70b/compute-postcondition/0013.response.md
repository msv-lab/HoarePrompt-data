The code creates a list called `examples`, which is populated by the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1. Since `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element, this means we are only including those files that have a second element of 1.

Since the initial state specifies that `files` is sorted and `n` is an integer within a specified range, the new list `examples` will contain entries based on the condition checked. We don't have specific values for `files` or the resulting values of `examples` because they depend on the contents of `files`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1.**
