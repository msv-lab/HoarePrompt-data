According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `examples`. Since `i` is currently 2, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. For the loop to execute again, the `examples` list must have at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `examples` must have at least 2 elements, which allows us to increment `i` without exceeding the bounds of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 3 elements, `script` contains the string 'move {file} 1' and 'move {file} 2' where `file` is the third element in `examples`, `i` is 3**
