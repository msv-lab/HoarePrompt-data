The `files` list is updated by appending a new tuple containing `name` (an input string) and `int(type_)` (the integer representation of another input string `type_`). The value of `n` remains at least 2, and the list `files` now contains at least one additional tuple. The state of other variables is unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `files` contains at least two tuples: the original tuple and a new tuple (`name`, `int(type_)`)**.
