Initial State: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list containing elements where the second element of the tuples from `files` is equal to 1, `script` contains strings 'move {file} i' for each element in `examples`, where `i` ranges from 1 to the length of `examples`, `i` is the length of `examples`, and if `examples` is empty, then `script` remains empty.**
