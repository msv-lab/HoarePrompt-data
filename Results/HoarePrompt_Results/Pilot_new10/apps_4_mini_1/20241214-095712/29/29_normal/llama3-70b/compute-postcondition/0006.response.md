The variable `name` is assigned a value from an input string, and `type_` is assigned a value from the input string which is then converted to an integer. The original tuple in `files` will be updated to include this new `name` and the integer value of `type_`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is not directly affected by this assignment, but we can assume `files` will now contain a new tuple with the new values. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `files` contains one tuple with (`name`, `int(type_)`), where `name` is an input string and `type_` is an input string converted to an integer.**
