The code appends a tuple containing the values of `name` and `int(type_)` to the `files` list. The variable `n` remains unchanged since the code does not modify it. The variable `type_` is converted to an integer and then stored in the list, along with `name`. 

Considering that `files` starts as an empty list, after running the code, it will contain one element, which is a tuple with `name` and the integer value of `type_`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `files` contains one tuple with (`name`, `int(type_)`), `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string converted to an integer.**
