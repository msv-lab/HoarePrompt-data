The code `print(line)` outputs the value of `line` to the console. Since `line` is the next line in the script and has not been altered by the code, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output is simply the value of `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `script` is non-empty, `examples` must not be empty, `line` is the next line in the script; value of `line` has been printed.**
