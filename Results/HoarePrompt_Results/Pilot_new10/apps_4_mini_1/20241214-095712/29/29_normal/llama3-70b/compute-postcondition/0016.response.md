To determine the appropriate states for the loop to execute, we need to evaluate the variables involved in the `for` loop:

1. The loop iterates over `examples`, which is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1.
2. For the loop to execute, the `examples` list must contain at least one element (i.e., it must not be empty).
3. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1.

Since the `examples` list depends on the `files` list and the value of the second element of each tuple, for the `examples` list to contain elements, there must be at least one tuple in `files` where the second element is 1.

Hence, the states we need to adjust are:

- `examples` must not be empty.
- Since `i` starts from 1, that will be the initial value of `i` upon entering the loop.

Based on this reasoning, the required state modifications are:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 1 element, `script` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `file` is the first element in `examples`.**
