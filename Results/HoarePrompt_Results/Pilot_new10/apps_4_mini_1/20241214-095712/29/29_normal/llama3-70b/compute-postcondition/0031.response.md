To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop conditions step by step:

1. The variable `script` is stated to have a length of `len(regular)` if `examples` is not empty. Conversely, if `examples` is empty, `script` is empty. This means that for the loop to execute, either `examples` must not be empty (which leads to `script` having a length of `len(regular)`), or we must have a non-empty `script`. 

2. The loop iterates over `script`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `script` needs to be non-empty. This implies `examples` must also not be empty since `script`'s content is dependent on `examples`.

3. The state before the loop must reflect information that ensures execution. There are no explicit constraints on `n` or `files` that impact the loop execution as presented.

Thus, the required conditions that must be satisfied for the execution of the loop are that `examples` should contain at least one element, ensuring `script` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `script` is non-empty, `examples` must not be empty**
