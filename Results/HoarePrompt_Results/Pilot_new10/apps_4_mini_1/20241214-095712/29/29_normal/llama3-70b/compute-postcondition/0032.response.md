The `print(line)` statement outputs the current value of `line` to the console. However, since the initial states of `line` are not mentioned and there are no variable assignments affecting `line`, we cannot determine its value from the given state. 

The states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the variables explicitly stated in the initial conditions. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `script` is non-empty, `examples` must not be empty, and `line` has been printed, although its value is unknown.**
