The variable `name` and `type_` are assigned the values from the input split by whitespace. The initial state indicates that `files` is a collection of tuples, but it does not specify how `name` and `type_` relate to the existing tuples in `files`. Since the values of `name` and `type_` will be determined by user input, we cannot specify their exact values but we know they will be strings and an integer respectively.

The rest of the initial conditions regarding `n` and `files` remain unchanged as the code only affects `name` and `type_`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `files` contains at least two tuples: the original tuple and a new tuple (`name`, `int(type_)`) where `name` is a string value from input and `type_` is an integer value from input.**
