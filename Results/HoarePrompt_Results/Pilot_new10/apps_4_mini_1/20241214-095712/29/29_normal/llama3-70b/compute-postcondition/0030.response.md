Since the code executes `print(len(script))`, we know that it will output the length of the `script`. 

Analyzing the initial state:
- `n` is an integer within the range [1, 100000].
- `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element.
- `examples` contains at least one element if any loop related to it has executed. If not, `examples` can be considered empty, implying that `script` would also be empty.
- `script` is formatted as `'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `regular`, where `i` is determined by the length of `examples` and `regular`.

The length of `script` will be determined based on how many files were in `regular` and the state of `examples`. If `examples` is not empty, the length of `script` will be equal to `len(regular)`. If `examples` is empty, `script` will remain empty, meaning its length will be 0.

Since we do not have a specific value for `len(regular)` or the state of `examples`, we know that:
- If examples is not empty, then the length of `script` corresponds to `len(regular)`.
- If examples is empty, then the length of `script` is 0.

Thus, considering the impact of the code on `script`, the output reflects the important variable states impacted by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple; `examples` determines whether `script` is of length `len(regular)` or 0. `script` has a length of `len(regular)` (if `examples` is not empty) or is empty (if `examples` is empty).**
