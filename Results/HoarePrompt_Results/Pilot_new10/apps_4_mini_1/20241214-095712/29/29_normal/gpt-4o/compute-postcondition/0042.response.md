The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is initially greater than 5, after the increment, it will now be greater than 6. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than 6, and `n` must be greater than 2.5.

Output State: **`examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than 6, and `n` must be greater than 2.5.**
