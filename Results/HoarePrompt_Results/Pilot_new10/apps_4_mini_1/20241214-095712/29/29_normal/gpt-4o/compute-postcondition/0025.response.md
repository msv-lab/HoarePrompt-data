`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it was defined such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, the only change occurs in `temp_counter`. The values of `examples`, `i`, and the validity condition regarding the relationships between `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`examples` contains at least 1 filename, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1**
