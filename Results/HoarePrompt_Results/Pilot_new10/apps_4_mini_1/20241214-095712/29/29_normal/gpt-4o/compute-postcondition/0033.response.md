The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `temp_counter` is greater than 3, after executing the code, `temp_counter` will now be greater than 4. Other variables are not affected, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than 4, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` continues to be appended to `moves`, and `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`**.
