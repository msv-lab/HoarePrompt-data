`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, which allows for at least one increment as long as we remain within that limit. The variable `temp_counter` now has a value of `temp_counter + 1`. The conditions for `temp_counter` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` being in `files_set` remain valid.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
