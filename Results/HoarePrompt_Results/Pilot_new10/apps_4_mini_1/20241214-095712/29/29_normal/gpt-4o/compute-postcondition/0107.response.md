The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The precondition states that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and after the increment, it will still satisfy this condition. However, without specific initial values or ranges for `temp_counter`, `n`, and the state of `moves`, I can only generalize the expected changes. 

Hence, the output state will indicate the updated value of `temp_counter`, while the conditions for `moves`, `temp_counter`, and `n` remain valid.

Output State: **`moves` includes the new command `move str(temp_counter) len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`.**
