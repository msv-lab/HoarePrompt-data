Postcondition: ***`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `i` is updated to equal `len(regulars)`, with `moves` including the command `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}` appended. Additionally, `regulars[i]` becomes equal to `str(temp_counter + 1)`.***
