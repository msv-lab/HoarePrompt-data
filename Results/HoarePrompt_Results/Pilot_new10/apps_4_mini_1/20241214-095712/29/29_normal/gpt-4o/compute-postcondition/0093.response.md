The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, after the operation, `temp_counter` will still satisfy this condition as long as it was initially less than or equal to `2 * n` prior to the increment. The condition on `str(temp_counter)` being in `files_set` remains unchanged and is still valid after the operation. Therefore, the output state is `temp_counter` has increased by 1, maintaining the constraints on `temp_counter` and `str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, `temp_counter` has increased by 1**
