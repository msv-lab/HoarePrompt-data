The code `regulars.append(name)` adds the `name` (which represents a filename) to the `regulars` list. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of tuples in `files`, but doesn't specify the exact contents of `regulars` before this operation. The states of `n` and `files` remain unchanged, while `regulars` will now include the new `name`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types; `regulars` now includes `name`.**
