Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than 2 and the final value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. The loop executes as long as `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n` while the string representation of `temp_counter` was present in `files_set`.**
