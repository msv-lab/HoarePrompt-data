In this scenario, the variable `name` and `type_` cannot be assigned a value due to an error in calling `split()` on a tuple instead of a string. Therefore, we assume that `name` remains unassigned and the assignment does not take place. 

Since we are attempting to append `name` to `examples`, but `name` is not assigned as per the error, this results in an issue. However, the action to append still takes place, likely resulting in `None` being appended or an error, but for the sake of this context, we will treat `name` as `None`.

Given that `examples` now includes a `None` value but no changes to other provided initial values, the output state reflects this condition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is None, `type_` is None, and `examples` is a list that now includes `None`.**
