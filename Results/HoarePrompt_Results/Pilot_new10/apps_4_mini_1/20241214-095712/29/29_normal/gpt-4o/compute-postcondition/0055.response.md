The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since the initial condition states that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 10, after incrementing, `temp_counter` will still be less than or equal to 10 unless it was originally 10, in which case it would now be 11, violating the constraint. However, it is given that `temp_counter` must remain under 10 based on the original state.

Therefore, assuming `temp_counter` was initially 10 or less, it could only validly increment from a value of 9 to 10. 

The other variables, `examples`, `i`, and `n`, remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`examples` contains at least 3 filenames, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is at most 10 and now it is 10, `n` must be at least 3, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
