The `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `temp_counter` must be less than 10 before the code is executed. Since we're only incrementing its value by 1, the new value of `temp_counter` will be less than 10, assuming it started at a value not exceeding 8. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output reflects `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, and `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`. 

Output State: **`examples` contains at least 3 filenames, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is increased by 1 (now less than 10), `n` is at least 3, and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.**
