Postcondition: ***`examples` must contain at least 1 filename, `i` is 0. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)` and `temp_counter` is greater than 4, then `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` continues to be appended to `moves`, and `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`.***
