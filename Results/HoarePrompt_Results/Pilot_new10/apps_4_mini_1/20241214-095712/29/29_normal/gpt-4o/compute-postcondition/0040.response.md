The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it was stated that `temp_counter` is greater than 4, after the execution, it will still be greater than 4. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than 5, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
