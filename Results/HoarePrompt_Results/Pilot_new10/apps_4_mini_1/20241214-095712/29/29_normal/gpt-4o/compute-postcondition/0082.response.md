Postcondition: ***`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations, `moves` contains all generated move commands, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1 + the number of moves appended` and less than or equal to `2 * n + the number of iterations executed`; `files_set` includes `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`, and `temp_counter` is now equal to `temp_counter + 1` if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.***
