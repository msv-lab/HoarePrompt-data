`temp_counter` is incremented by 1, which affects its previous value. The states of the other variables remain the same. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and after incrementing, it will still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` unless `temp_counter` was already at its maximum value. The condition `str(temp_counter + 1)` must still be in `files_set` to be valid. 

Output State: **`moves` includes the new command `move str(temp_counter) len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is the previous value incremented by 1, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`.**
