`examples[i]` is assigned the value of `str(temp_counter)`, which converts the current value of `temp_counter` to its string representation. The value of `temp_counter` was initially greater than 2, and after the increment, it needs to reflect the current state. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than 3, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` continues to be appended to `moves`, and `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`**.
