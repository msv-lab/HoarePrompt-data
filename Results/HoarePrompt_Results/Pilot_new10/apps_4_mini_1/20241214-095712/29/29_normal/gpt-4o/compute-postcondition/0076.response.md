According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. The loop will execute again if two conditions are satisfied: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, meaning that `temp_counter` could possibly be equal to `2 * n + 1` (but not less than that). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be no greater than `2 * n` which is already satisfied by being less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`.

Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must already be in `files_set`. The fact that `str(temp_counter)` must be included in `files_set` is also satisfied according to the state provided.

Since both conditions are already met at the end of the previous iteration, there are no states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` must be included in `files_set`**
