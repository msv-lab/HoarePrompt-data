The code snippet assigns the values of `name` and `type_` by splitting the `file` tuple. The `file` tuple is expected to contain two elements (the filename and the file type) because the `split` method divides a string into parts based on whitespace.

Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000),
- `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types,
- `file` is the next file tuple in the list (index `k+1`).

Since `file` is a tuple, invoking `split()` on it will raise an error because the `split()` method is meant for strings, not tuples. Therefore, we assume instead that `file` is meant to be a string containing the filename and type.

Assuming `file` is a string of the form "filename type", after executing the code, `name` and `type_` will hold the respective values derived from this string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types; `name` is the filename, `type_` is the file type extracted from the string `file`.**
