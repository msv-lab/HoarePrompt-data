`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The condition states that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, so after the increment, `temp_counter` will still satisfy this condition as long as it was initially less than `2 * n`. The other conditions involving `str(temp_counter)` being in `files_set` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be included in `files_set`.**
