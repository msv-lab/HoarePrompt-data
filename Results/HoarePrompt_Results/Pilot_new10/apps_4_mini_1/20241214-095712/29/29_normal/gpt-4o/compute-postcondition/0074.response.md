To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop can continue.

1. The loop requires that `temp_counter` be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` was incremented (i.e., `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`), for the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must not exceed `2 * n`.
   
2. The second condition for the loop to continue is that `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` has been incremented at the end of the previous iteration, for it to be included in `files_set`, it must already exist in `files_set` or `files_set` must be adjusted accordingly.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:

- `temp_counter` must be adjusted such that it remains less than or equal to `2 * n`, which means `n` could remain the same, but `temp_counter`, after being incremented, must satisfy that condition.
- Either `files_set` must be updated to include `str(temp_counter)` after the increment, or the values of `temp_counter` must be adjusted down to ensure `str(temp_counter)` exists in `files_set`.

State: **`temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be included in `files_set`**
