The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, after the increment, `temp_counter` can be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` must be included in `files_set`**.
