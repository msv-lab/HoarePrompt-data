You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
    return moves

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several logical issues that can lead to incorrect handling of file renaming:

1. **Handling of Duplicate Target Filenames**: The program lacks a proper mechanism to ensure that the target filenames for the `move` operation (i.e., the new names) are guaranteed to be distinct and not already in use. The condition `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:` does not adequately prevent conflicts with existing filenames if the same number is attempted to be used for both examples and subsequent files.

2. **Incorrect Target Assignment Logic**: The implementation seems to incorrectly assign target filenames based on the current file index and the number of examples or regular tests. It assumes that the target name corresponds direct to the order of input and fails to handle cases where names could be reused or incorrectly positioned.

3. **Edge Cases of Existing Filenames**: In cases where existing filenames have numeric values (like "1", "2", ...), the while loop should check that the new file does not collide with any existing filename, but this is not done effectively. There can be cases where the new target filenames are already taken by other files which will lead to rewriting unintended files.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 0
2 1
3 0
4 1
5 0
```
This example has potential conflicting target names when the `move` script is generated. The logic should ensure that every target filename is checked against the resultant filenames set to prevent overwrites. The provided logic does not ensure that renaming conforms to the constraints properly for all inputs.

Given these flaws and considering that functionality is compromised in the above scenarios, the program cannot be considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` strings representing filenames and their associated types (0 for regular tests and 1 for example tests). It generates and returns a list of move commands to reorganize the filenames based on their types. If filenames are not in their expected positions, it generates commands to move them to new temporary positions or to their final target positions, while ensuring that each filename's representation conforms to a specific ordering. The code does not handle potential cases where the `files` list may contain invalid entries or types beyond the expected '0' and '1', nor does it enforce the correctness of the input formatting for filenames. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
