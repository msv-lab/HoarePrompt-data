The code assigns the value of `str(temp_counter)` to `examples[i]`. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `i` is 2, `examples` contains at least 3 filenames, and `n` is at least 3. The impact of the assignment is that the third index (zero-based) of `examples` now holds the string representation of `temp_counter`. The initial information about `temp_counter`, `i`, `examples`, and `n` remains valid, but `examples[2]` gets updated to be `str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `i` is 2, `examples` contains at least 2 previous filenames and the value of `examples[2]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `n` is at least 3**
