You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze how it functions and identify any potential edge cases or issues.

### Problem Breakdown
The goal is to rename files so that:
1. All examples are moved to filenames "1", "2", ..., "e" (where 'e' is the total number of examples).
2. All regular tests are in filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n" (where 'n' is the total number of files).
3. We need to maintain a move log that contains the moves in the specific format.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n` files and their types.
   - Distinguishes between example (`1`) and regular (`0`) tests.
   
2. **File Renaming Logic:**
   - It constructs the `moves` list based on what files need to be renamed.
   - It begins naming examples starting from `n + 1` and ensures they are not named to any filenames that already exist.
   - It repeats this for regular test files.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no example tests, all files should be named sequentially from `1` to `n`, which seems to be handled correctly.
   - If all tests are examples, they should all be given unique names from `1` to `e` while ensuring regular test files receive names beyond the total count of examples.

### Potential Issue
There is a potential flaw where on line 25 (`if examples[i] != str(i + 1):`), while renaming, it checks if `examples[i]` (the current name) is equal to `str(i + 1)`, but it doesn't enforce that it should only move if it is necessary. There might be cases where the newly renamed file (to a non-sequential or non-existing name) might already conflict with the desired format.

Similarly, the second check for regular tests could have a failing case as well. For instance, if the `regulars` naming collides with example names during the move sequence, or the adjusted target for regular tests does not take the previously adjusted `temp_counter`.

#### Example of a Case Where It Might Fail:
Suppose there are 3 files:
```
1 0
2 1
3 0
```
The expected output should format the examples (2 becomes 1), and rename 1 to 4 and 3 to 2, as the existing names would collide. The way it is written, it may end up trying to assign an example to `1` but not resolving the collision correctly creating an unwanted state.

### Conclusion
Given these observations and potential edge cases where the program fails to reliably produce the correct renaming of all files while considering pre-existing names, it is clear there are cases where the output might not meet the required distinct naming.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
