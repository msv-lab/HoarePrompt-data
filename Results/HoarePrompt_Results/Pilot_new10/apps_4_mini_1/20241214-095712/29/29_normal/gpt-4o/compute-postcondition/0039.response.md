To determine whether the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions specified in both the loop header and the provided program state.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

From the provided state right before the loop:
- `examples` contains at least 2 filenames (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `i` is 1 (this might relate to the index of `examples` but is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `temp_counter` is greater than 4.
- `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` (this is crucial as it affects the second part of the loop condition).
- `moves` includes 'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}' (this does not directly affect the loop condition).
- `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)` if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)` (additional context about the filenames but does not influence the loop condition).

Now, let's break them down:
1. For the loop to execute, both conditions in the `while` loop need to be satisfied. 
2. The first condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` could still be satisfied as long as `n` is sufficiently large.
3. The second condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` is a blocker since it is currently stated that `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. Therefore, this condition needs to be adjusted.

To make sure the loop can execute, we will need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is included in `files_set`. No adjustments are needed for `temp_counter` or `n`, as `temp_counter` is already greater than 4.

State Adjustment:
State: **`examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than 4, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
