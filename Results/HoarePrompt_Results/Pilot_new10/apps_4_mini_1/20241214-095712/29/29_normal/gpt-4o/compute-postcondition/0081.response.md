The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `temp_counter` was originally within the bounds set by `n` and the associated moves/iterations. The variable `files_set` includes `str(temp_counter)` and `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`. After incrementing, `temp_counter` will still be greater than or equal to `n + 1 + the number of moves appended` and less than or equal to `2 * n + the number of iterations executed`, but now representing `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1 + the number of moves appended` and less than or equal to `2 * n + the number of iterations executed`; `files_set` includes `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`, and `temp_counter` is now equal to `temp_counter + 1`.**
