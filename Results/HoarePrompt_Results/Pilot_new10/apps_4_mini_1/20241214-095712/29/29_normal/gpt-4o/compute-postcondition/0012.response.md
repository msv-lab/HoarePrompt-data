The code attempts to append `name` to the `regulars` list. However, `name` could not be assigned any value due to an error when trying to call `split()` on a tuple, which is incorrect since `split()` should be called on a string. Therefore, `name` is not defined, and the operation to append `name` to `regulars` cannot occur.

Since `name` is undefined, the addition to `regulars` does not happen. The values of `n`, `files`, and `file` remain unchanged, but there's an error in the context of appending `name`. Thus, we will indicate that `name` could not be assigned a value leading to no change in `regulars`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is not defined due to an error, `type_` cannot be assigned, and `regulars` remains unchanged.**
