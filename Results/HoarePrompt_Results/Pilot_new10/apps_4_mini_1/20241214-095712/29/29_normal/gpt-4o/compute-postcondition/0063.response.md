The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Before the execution of the code, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`. Since `n` is at least 3, this means `2 * n` is at least 6, thus `temp_counter` must be greater than 6. Therefore, after incrementing `temp_counter` by 1, it will still be greater than `2 * n`.

The variables `i` and `examples` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`+1, `i` is 2, `examples` contains at least 2 previous filenames and the value of `examples[2]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `n` is at least 3**.
