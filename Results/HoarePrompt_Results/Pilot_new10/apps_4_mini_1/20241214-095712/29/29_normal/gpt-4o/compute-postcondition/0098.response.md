Postcondition: ***`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations; `moves` includes the command `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}`; `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and has incremented by 1; `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `regulars[i]` is now equal to `str(temp_counter)`; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1` if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`; `i` is now `i + 1` and less than `len(regulars)`.***
