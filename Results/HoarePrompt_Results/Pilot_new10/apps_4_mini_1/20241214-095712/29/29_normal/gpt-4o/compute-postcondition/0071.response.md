Postcondition: ***`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations, `moves` contains all generated move commands, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1 + the number of moves appended, `files_set` includes entries reflecting any changes made during the iterations, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`***
