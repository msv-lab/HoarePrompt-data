According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: `temp_counter` and whether `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. For the loop to execute, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Right before the loop:
- `temp_counter` is greater than 5. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This implies that `n` must be at least 3 (since `2 * n` should be at least 6).
- The variable `files_set` should contain the string representation of `temp_counter`, which is `str(temp_counter)`. Since `temp_counter` is greater than 5, `files_set` must contain the string representation of at least 6 or whatever value `temp_counter` has if it is greater than 6.

Thus, we need to ensure `n` is at least 3, and `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`.

State: **`examples` contains at least 3 filenames, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 10, `n` must be at least 3, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set**
