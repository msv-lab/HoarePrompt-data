Postcondition: ***`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, then both `left` and `right` are increased by 1, and `bottom` is also increased by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the values of `left`, `right`, and `bottom`.***
