Postcondition: ***`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, and `s` is the second tuple in the list `sofas`. If `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` is equal to `s[0][0]`, then `bottom` is increased by 1. If the condition is not satisfied, `bottom` remains unchanged.***
