Postcondition: ***`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, and `s` is the second tuple in the list `sofas`. If `sofa[0][0]` is greater than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` is equal to `s[0][1]`, then `right` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `right` remains unchanged.***
