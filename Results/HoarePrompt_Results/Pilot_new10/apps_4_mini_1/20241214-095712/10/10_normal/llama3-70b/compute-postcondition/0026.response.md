According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `sofas`, which consists of tuples. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that there are more tuples in the `sofas` list. At the end of the last iteration, `sofas` has at least 2 tuples, and `s` represents the second tuple in the list. This means there is currently a tuple at index 1, and we need to ensure that upon the next iteration, `s` will be the next tuple in the list.

To execute one more time, `s` will become the third tuple in the list which is at index 2, and for the loop to properly execute, `sofas` must contain at least 3 tuples.

State: **`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `s` is the third tuple in the list `sofas`**
