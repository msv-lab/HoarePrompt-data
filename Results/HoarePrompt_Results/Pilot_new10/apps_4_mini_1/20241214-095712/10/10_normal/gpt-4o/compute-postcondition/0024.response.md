Since `i` equals `j` is true (as both are initialized to `0`), the execution of the given code line is skipped and the current state remains unchanged regarding `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[0] and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
