The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to stop, and the next iteration begins immediately. The variables `right_count[1]`, `left_count[1]`, `bottom_count[1]`, `top_count[1]`, `d`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right_count[1]`, `left_count[1]`, `bottom_count[1]`, and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons with all sofas except `sofas[1]`, `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the attributes of `sofas[2]`, `j` is 0, and `i` is equal to `j`.**
