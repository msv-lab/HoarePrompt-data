The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `target_sofa` is 2, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
