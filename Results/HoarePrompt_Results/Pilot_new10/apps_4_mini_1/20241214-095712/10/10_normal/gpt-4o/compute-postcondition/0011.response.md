The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the existing tuple in `sofas`. The values of `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this operation. The `sofas` list now contains the original tuple along with the new one. Consequently, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the updated state of `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` contains the original tuple plus the new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**.
