The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0, `target_sofa` will be equal to 1 after the execution. The values of `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `left_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` remain unchanged since they are not impacted by the assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[i]`, and `left_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are equal to `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` respectively; `target_sofa` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[i]`, and `left_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are equal to `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` respectively; `target_sofa` is equal to 1.**
