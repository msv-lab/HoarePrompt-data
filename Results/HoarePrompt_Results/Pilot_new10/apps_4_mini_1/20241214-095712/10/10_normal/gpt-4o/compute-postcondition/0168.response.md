The function accepts parameters representing the number of sofas (d), the dimensions of the matrix (n and m), and the coordinates of each sofa. It reads these parameters from user input and constructs a list of tuples representing the sofas. The function then counts how many sofas are positioned to the left, right, above, and below each respective sofa. Finally, it checks if any sofa meets the specified counts for each direction (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) and returns the index (1-based) of the first sofa that satisfies these counts. If no such sofa exists, it will return -1. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `d` for the number of sofas, two integers `n` and `m` for matrix dimensions, coordinates for each sofa, and counts for sofas in specified directions. It counts the number of sofas to the left, right, above, and below each sofa, and returns the index of the first sofa that matches the specified count criteria or -1 if none match. **
