Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` are updated counts based on comparisons. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[1]` remains unchanged, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and `bottom_count[2]` and `top_count[1]` remain unchanged. The conditions `d` is greater than 2, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the values from `sofas[2]` hold true. Otherwise, no changes occur in counts.***
