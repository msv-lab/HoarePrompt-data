Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's an explanation of the specific issues:

1. **Counting Logic Error**: 
   - The conditions checks in the nested loop that increment `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are flawed. For instance:
     - To determine if a sofa is to the left of another, the program checks if the entire sofa (both coordinates) is to the left. The correct condition should be if **any** part of the first sofa is to the left of the second sofa.
     - Specifically, the condition `if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j:` incorrectly assumes both parts of sofa `i` are to the left of sofa `j`. This will fail in cases where the two sofas overlap or are adjacent vertically.

2. **Incorrect Conditions for Counting Above and Below**: 
   - Similarly, `if y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j:` checks whether both parts of the first sofa are situated above the second sofa, which is incorrect. Instead, it should check if any part of the first sofa is above the second.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The output includes a `target_sofa` that is set to -1 if no matches are found or the index of the first one found. The counting logic must be fundamentally sound for this to yield correct values. Given how it currently operates, `target_sofa` could incorrectly reflect whether the counts actually satisfy the given conditions in the problem.

In summary, the program's logic has errors in how it counts the nearby sofas in relation to Grandpa Maks's sofa, thus it can return incorrect results. This leads to the conclusion that the program does not correctly implement the required functionality as specified in the problem description.
