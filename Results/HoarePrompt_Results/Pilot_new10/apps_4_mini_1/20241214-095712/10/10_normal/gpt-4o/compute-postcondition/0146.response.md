Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` are updated counts based on comparisons. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is also less than `y1_j`, then `right_count` remains unchanged, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `bottom_count[i]` is updated based on its previous value plus 1, and `top_count[1]` remains unchanged, given the conditions `d > 2`, `i > 2`, `j = 2`, and that `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the values from `sofas[2]`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur in counts.***
