Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged. If `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged. The current values satisfy that `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is also greater than `y2_j`.***
