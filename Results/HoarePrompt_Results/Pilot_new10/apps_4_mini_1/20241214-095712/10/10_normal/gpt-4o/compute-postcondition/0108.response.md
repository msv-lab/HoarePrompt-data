According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute depends on the variable `d`. For the loop to execute, `d` must be greater than 0. Since it is given that `d` is greater than 1, the loop can execute, and we need to ensure that the loop variable `j` starts at 0 during its first iteration.

State: **`right_count[1]` and `left_count[1]` and `bottom_count[1]` and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons with all sofas except `sofas[1]`, `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are the attributes of `sofas[2]`, `j` is 0**
