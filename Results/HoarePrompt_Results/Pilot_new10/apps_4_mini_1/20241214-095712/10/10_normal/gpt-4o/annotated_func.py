#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is an integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) representing the number of sofas, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) representing the dimensions of the matrix, and each of the next d lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) such that (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n) and (1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m), representing the coordinates of the sofas. The last line consists of four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) where (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1).

If no sofa satisfies these conditions, the earlier value of `target_sofa` remains unchanged, which was initially -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `d` for the number of sofas, two integers `n` and `m` for matrix dimensions, coordinates for each sofa, and counts for sofas in specified directions. It counts the number of sofas to the left, right, above, and below each sofa, and returns the index of the first sofa that matches the specified count criteria or -1 if none match.
