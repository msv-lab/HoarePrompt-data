According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be at least 2 (since `j` will be incremented by 1) and `j` will become 2 if the loop is executed again.

State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`**
