The code assigns the values from `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, meaning we will be accessing the second element of the `sofas` list (index 1). Since `i` is not equal to `j`, we execute the assignment. Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, we update the output state with the newly assigned values:

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`**.
