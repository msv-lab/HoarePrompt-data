According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and the variable `d`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `d` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

After the last iteration, `j` will become 1. Since `d` is greater than 1, the loop can still execute again as long as the condition `j < d` is satisfied. Thus, for the loop to continue executing, `j` should be updated to 1, and the updated condition for `d` is that it must remain greater than 1.

State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged.**
