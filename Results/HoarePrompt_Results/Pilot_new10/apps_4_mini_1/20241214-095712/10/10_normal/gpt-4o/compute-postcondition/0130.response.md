Postcondition: ***`right_count[1]`, `left_count[1]`, `bottom_count[2]`, and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons. If `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[2]` is updated counts based on comparisons and is increased by 1. The values of `d`, `i`, and `j` remain greater than 2, 2, and 1 respectively, while `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the values from `sofas[1]`.***
