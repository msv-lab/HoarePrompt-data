Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is also greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1. If the condition is not satisfied, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
