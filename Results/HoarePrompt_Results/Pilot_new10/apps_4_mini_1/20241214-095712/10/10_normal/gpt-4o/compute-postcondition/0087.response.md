`left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so `left_count[1]` is increased by 1. The conditions involving `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged and do not affect the execution of this snippet. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `left_count[1]` is increased by 1, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged.**
