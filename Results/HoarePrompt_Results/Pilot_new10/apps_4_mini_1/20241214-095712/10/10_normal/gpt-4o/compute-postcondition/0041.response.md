The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so `right_count[0]` will be increased by 1. The other variables (`d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`, `right_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
