The code snippet executes a line that assigns new values to the variables `n` and `m` based on user input. Previously, `n` and `m` were positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5). After executing the code `n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())`, both `n` and `m` will be updated to the values entered by the user through the input. Since the specific values for `n` and `m` after input are not defined, they will be represented as user-defined positive integers.

Output State: **`d` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is a positive integer which is the user-defined value, and `m` is a positive integer which is the user-defined value**
