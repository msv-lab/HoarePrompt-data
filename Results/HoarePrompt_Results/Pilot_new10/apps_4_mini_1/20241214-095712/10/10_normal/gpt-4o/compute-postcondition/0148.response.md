Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` are updated counts. If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `bottom_count[i]` is updated based on its previous value plus 1, and `top_count[i]` is updated based on its previous value plus 1, while `right_count` remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, no changes occur in the counts.***
