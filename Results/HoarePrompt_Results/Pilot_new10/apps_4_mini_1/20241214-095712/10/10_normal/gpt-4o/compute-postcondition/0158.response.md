The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of `target_sofa` becomes 2. The other variables (`d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unaffected, as they are not involved in this line of code.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `target_sofa` is 2, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[1]**.
