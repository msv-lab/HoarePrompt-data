Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `target_sofa` is either -1 or the index of the first sofa that satisfies the conditions defined by `left_count[i] == cnt_l`, `right_count[i] == cnt_r`, `top_count[i] == cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i] == cnt_b`. The value of `target_sofa` remains unchanged if no sofa meets the conditions. Thus, `print(target_sofa)` outputs the current value of `target_sofa`.**
