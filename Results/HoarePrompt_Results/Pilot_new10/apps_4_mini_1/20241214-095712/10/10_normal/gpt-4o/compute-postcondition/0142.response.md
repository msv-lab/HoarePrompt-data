Postcondition: ***`right_count[1]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[2]`, and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons. Given that `d` is greater than 2, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the values from `sofas[2]`, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is also less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
