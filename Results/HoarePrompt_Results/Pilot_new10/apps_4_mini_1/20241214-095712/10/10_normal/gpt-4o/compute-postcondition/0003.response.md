According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`, which is an integer representing the number of sofas. The loop is set to execute `d` times. Since `d` is already defined as an integer within the range of 1 to 10^5, the loop will execute as long as `d` is at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, there are no iterations yet, so the loop variable (underscore `_`) does not hold any specific value during the initialization. After the loop executes the first iteration, it can be assumed that the loop variable will have the value 0 for the first iteration.

Given that the list `sofas` is empty before the loop, it does not influence the loopâ€™s execution. The key variable that ensures the loop executes is `d`, which must be at least 1.

State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is an empty list, loop variable is 0 (after first iteration).**
