The variable `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. Since `t` is 1, `t + 1` becomes 2. Therefore, `current_cost` is updated as follows:

`current_cost += length - 2`

The value of `length` is the next integer in the list `a`, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), we know that `length` is at least 1.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one integer remaining for iteration, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is an integer from the list `a`, and `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 2)`**.
