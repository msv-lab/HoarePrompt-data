Postcondition: ***`current_cost` remains unchanged, `min_cost` remains 0, and `best_t` is unchanged. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`. If `length` is less than or equal to `t + 1`, `current_cost` remains unchanged. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.***
