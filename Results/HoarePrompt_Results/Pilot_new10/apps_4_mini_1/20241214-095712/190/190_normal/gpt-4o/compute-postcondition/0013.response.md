Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is either the previous value reduced by `length` if `length` is less than `t - 1`, or remains a positive value greater than 0 with `length` updated to a value greater than or equal to 2 if `length` is greater than `t + 1`.***
