The variable `current_cost` is modified by adding to it the result of the expression `length - (t + 1)`. Here, `length` is the next integer in the list `a`. The value of `t` remains unknown. Therefore, after updating `current_cost`, its new value will be a positive or negative integer depending on the values of `length` and `t`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer, `length` is the next integer in `a`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains at 1**.
