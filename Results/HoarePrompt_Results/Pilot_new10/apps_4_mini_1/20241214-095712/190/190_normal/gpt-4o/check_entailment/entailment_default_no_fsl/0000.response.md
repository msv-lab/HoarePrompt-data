Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal integer `t` that minimizes the cost of adjusting the stick lengths to be "almost good". The program iterates over potential values of `t` from 1 to 100, calculating the cost for transforming each stick length to be within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]`.

1. For each stick length, if it's lower than `t - 1`, the program adds the cost of increasing it to `t - 1`. If the stick length is greater than `t + 1`, the cost of reducing it to `t + 1` is accounted.
2. The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding value of `t` that achieves this cost.

The program successfully accounts for all possible cases within the problem constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100), which includes:
- A situation where adjustments are needed for multiple sticks.
- Cases where sticks are already almost good and require no changes (resulting in zero cost).

The examples given in the problem description and output hints confirm that various scenarios are handled correctly. Furthermore, since there are only a limited number of values for `t` (from 1 to 100), the iteration ensures that no potential case is skipped.

Thus, the code adheres to the problem requirements for all input values, and the output is correctly formatted as per the specifications.
