Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is updated to the previous value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is 1, `t` is 2, and `length` is the first integer in the list `a`. The current value of `length` is less than `t - 1`, which means that `length` is less than 1.***
