The variable `best_t` is assigned the value `-1`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `best_t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000; `a` is now a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is set to float('inf'); `best_t` is -1.**
