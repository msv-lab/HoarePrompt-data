To analyze the provided code snippet, we evaluate how `current_cost` is affected based on the existing variable states. 

- `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its previous value.
- We know from the initial state that:
  - `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000.
  - `a` is a list containing `n` integers, with at least one more integer remaining for iteration.
  - `min_cost` is initialized to `float('inf')`, indicating no minimum cost has been found yet.
  - `best_t` starts at -1, meaning no optimal time has been selected initially.
  - `t` is initialized at 1.
  - `length` takes its value from the next integer in the list `a`.

Now let's summarize the transformations to `current_cost`:

1. Identify `length` as the next integer in `a` (denote this as `a_next`).
2. Since `t` is 1, the expression for `current_cost` simplifies to `current_cost += 1 - 1 - length`, which leads to `current_cost += -length`.

Thus, `current_cost` decreases based on the value of `length`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one more integer remaining for iteration, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is the next integer in the list `a`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost - length`.**
