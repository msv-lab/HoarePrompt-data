The code assigns the value of `current_cost` to `min_cost`. Since `current_cost` is less than `min_cost` at the beginning, after this assignment, `min_cost` will now equal `current_cost`. The values of `n`, `a`, `best_t`, `t`, and the relationship regarding `current_cost` being less than `min_cost` before the assignment remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 100), `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and the current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost` before the assignment.**
