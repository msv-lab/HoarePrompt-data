Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `length` is the next integer in `a`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to equal its previous value plus `length - (t + 1)`, while `min_cost` remains unchanged and `best_t` remains at 1.***
