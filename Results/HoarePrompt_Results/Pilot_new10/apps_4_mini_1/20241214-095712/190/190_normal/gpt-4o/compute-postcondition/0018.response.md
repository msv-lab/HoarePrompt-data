Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one more integer remaining for iteration, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `length` is the next integer in the list `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost - length`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 2.`***
