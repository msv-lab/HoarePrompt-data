Postcondition: ***`current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` are all determined based on the comparison of `current_cost` and `min_cost`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, `best_t` remains as 100, and `t` remains 100; if `a` is empty, then `current_cost` remains 0 and both `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
