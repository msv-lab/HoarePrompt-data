Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer, `length` is the next integer in `a`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, and `best_t` remains at 1 if `length` is greater than `t + 1`. If `length` is less than or equal to `t + 1`, there is no change to the values of `current_cost`, `min_cost`, or `best_t`.***
