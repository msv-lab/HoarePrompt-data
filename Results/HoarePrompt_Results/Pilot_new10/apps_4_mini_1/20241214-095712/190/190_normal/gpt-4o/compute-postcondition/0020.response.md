The initial state includes the following variables: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one integer remaining for iteration, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `length` is the next integer in the list `a` (after the current `length`).

The line of code provided is:
```
current_cost += t - 1 - length
```

Now, let's analyze this line of code:

- `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `(t - 1 - length)`.
- The variable `t` is given as 1, so calculating `(t - 1)` results in `(1 - 1)` which is `0`.
- This simplifies the calculation to `current_cost += 0 - length`, or `current_cost += -length`.
- This means that `current_cost` will decrease by the value of `length`.

None of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`) are modified in this line.

With this understanding, after executing the line of code, the state of the variables will be updated as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one integer remaining for iteration, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is the next integer in the list `a`, and `current_cost` is decreased by `length`.**
