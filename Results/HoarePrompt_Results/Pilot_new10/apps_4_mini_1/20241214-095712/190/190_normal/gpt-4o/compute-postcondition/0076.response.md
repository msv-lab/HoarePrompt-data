The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost`. Given that `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, the value of `min_cost` will now equal `current_cost`, which is a specific value less than the previous `min_cost` of 0. The values of `best_t`, `t`, and `a` are unchanged. The state of `current_cost` is valid since it is mentioned that it remains either equal to its previous value or is updated in this context.

Output State: **`current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` remains unchanged, `t` is still 100, and `a` is the list of lengths processed in the loop; if `a` is empty, then `current_cost` remains 0.**
