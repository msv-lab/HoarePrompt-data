The code executes a print statement, which outputs the values of `best_t` and `min_cost`. The variable `n` retains its state as a positive integer, and `a` remains a list of integers. However, the values of `best_t` and `min_cost` are unknown prior to execution, so they will be printed out as-is.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), printed values are `best_t` and `min_cost`.**
