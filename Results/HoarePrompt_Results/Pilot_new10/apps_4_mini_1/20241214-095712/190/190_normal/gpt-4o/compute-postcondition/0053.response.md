Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is the total cost after analyzing all elements in `a`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is equal to `t` if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`. If `current_cost` is not less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` remains unchanged, and `best_t` remains at its previous value.***
