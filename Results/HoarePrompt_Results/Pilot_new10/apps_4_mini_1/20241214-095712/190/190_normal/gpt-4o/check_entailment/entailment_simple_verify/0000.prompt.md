You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_t = -1
    for t in range(1, 101):
        current_cost = 0
        for length in a:
            if length < t - 1:
                current_cost += t - 1 - length
            elif length > t + 1:
                current_cost += length - (t + 1)
        if current_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = current_cost
            best_t = t
    print(best_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we will analyze its logic against the problem description.

The program aims to find a positive integer \( t \) such that all given stick lengths are almost good for this \( t \) while minimizing the total cost of changing the lengths. The cost to change a length \( a_i \) to be almost good (i.e., within 1 unit of \( t \)) is calculated correctly. Specifically:

- If \( a_i < t - 1 \): The cost to increase \( a_i \) to \( t - 1 \) is \( (t - 1) - a_i \).
- If \( a_i > t + 1 \): The cost to decrease \( a_i \) to \( t + 1 \) is \( a_i - (t + 1) \).

However, there is a logical issue in the cost calculations:

1. The program only considers the intervals \( [t - 1, t + 1] \) for the costs. It does not properly account for lengths that are either exactly \( t \), or within \( t \) (like \( t \)).
2. The program does not handle edge cases where stick lengths might be at the extremes. For example, if all stick lengths are either much lower than the optimal \( t - 1 \) or much higher than \( t + 1 \), it could lead to a higher than necessary cost, as it does not utilize \( t \) directly.

To illustrate this with a counterexample:

Consider the stick lengths:
```
1 100
```

If we analyze the cost for \( t = 50 \):
- For stick length \( 1 \): The cost would be to change it to \( 49 \), which costs \( |1 - 49| = 48 \).
- For stick length \( 100 \): The cost would be to change it to \( 51 \), which costs \( |100 - 51| = 49 \).

Thus, the total cost is \( 48 + 49 = 97 \).

However, if we take \( t = 1 \):
- Stick length \( 1 \) is already almost good (cost = 0).
- To make \( 100 \) almost good, we can change it to \( 2 \) with a cost of \( |100 - 2| = 98 \).

Here, the total minimum cost is actually \( 98 \) when \( t = 1 \), but the code may not correctly validate all appropriate \( t \) values in this range across the domain provided.

This indicates that there are cases where the program's logic fails to yield the minimum cost effectively due to its incorrect treatment of edge conditions and the selected \( t \) bounds.

Thus, the final determination is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_t = -1
    for t in range(1, 101):
        current_cost = 0
        
        for length in a:
            if length < t - 1:
                current_cost += t - 1 - length
            elif length > t + 1:
                current_cost += length - (t + 1)
        
        if current_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = current_cost
            best_t = t
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `min_cost` is the minimum cost computed across all iterations, `best_t` is the value of `t` that provides the minimum cost.
    print(best_t, min_cost)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
