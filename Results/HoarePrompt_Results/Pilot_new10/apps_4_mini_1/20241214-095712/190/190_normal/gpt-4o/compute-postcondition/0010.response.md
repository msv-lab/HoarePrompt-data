Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0, and during the first iteration, the value of `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (0) and currently, `length` is greater than `t + 1` (2).***
