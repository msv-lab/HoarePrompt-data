The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost`. Given that the current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, after this assignment, `min_cost` will now be equal to `current_cost`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`current_cost` is the total cost after analyzing all elements in `a`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements.**
