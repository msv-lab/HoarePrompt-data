Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, `min_t` is assigned the value of 101, and `i` remains 101, while `cost` equals the sum of the minimum distances of elements in `sticks` from 100 and 101. If `cost` is not less than `min_cost`, the values of `min_cost`, `min_t`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `cost` continues to represent the sum of the minimum distances of elements in `sticks` from 100 and 101.***
