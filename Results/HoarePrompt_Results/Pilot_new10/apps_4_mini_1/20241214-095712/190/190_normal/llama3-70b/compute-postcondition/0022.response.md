The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x), abs(x - 1)) for each x in sticks.

Output State: **`min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x), abs(x - 1)) for each x in sticks.**
