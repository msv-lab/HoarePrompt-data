The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `t`, which is equal to `mid`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with a value input between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers representing the lengths of sticks; `mid` is the value of `sticks[n // 2]; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `mid`.
