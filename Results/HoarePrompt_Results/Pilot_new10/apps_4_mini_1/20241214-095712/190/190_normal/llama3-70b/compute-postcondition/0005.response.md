The variable `t` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is equal to `sticks[n // 2]`, which indicates it is the median of the sorted list `sticks`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `cost` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer with a value input between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers representing the lengths of sticks; `mid` is the value of `sticks[n // 2]; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`.**
