In analyzing the provided code and the conditions under which the loop executes, here's the detailed breakdown for the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

The loop starts from `mid - 1` and decrements down to 1 (inclusive), checking each value of `i`. The conditions for updating `min_cost` and `min_t` depend on the computed `cost`.

After all iterations, there are two possible scenarios:
1. If the loop executed at least once, then the minimum value of `i` that was checked is 1, and the loop will have found the minimum cost at some point in the range from `mid - 1` to `1`.
2. If `mid` is equal to 1, the loop will not execute as `mid - 1` becomes 0. 

Given that `n` can take a range that allows `mid` to be at least `2` or greater, and `a` is sorted ensuring these prior conditions. 

Thus, the final state will reflect the lowest calculated `min_cost` encountered during the loop, the corresponding `min_t`, and the exit condition from the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers; if the loop executed, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found, `min_t` is the corresponding value of `t` that minimized the cost; otherwise, if the loop did not execute, `min_cost` remains equal to the initial `cost` and `min_t` is equal to `mid`.**
