The statement `min_cost = cost` assigns the current value of `cost` to `min_cost`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `min_cost`, which now takes on the value of `cost`. The other variables remain unchanged. It is known that `cost` is currently less than `min_cost` prior to this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, `min_t` is the corresponding value of `t` that minimized the cost, `i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is less than 100, and the current value of `cost` is less than the previous `min_cost`.**
