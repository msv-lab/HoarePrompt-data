The variable `cost` is assigned the value of the sum of the minimum distances of the elements in `sticks` from `i` (which is initially 101) and `i-1` (which would be 100). This calculation involves iterating over the elements of `sticks` and determining the smallest distance for each element to either 101 or 100, and then summing those minimum distances to get `cost`. 

The initial state indicates that `i` is greater than 100, which means that for the loop to run again, `i` needs to be adjusted down to 100 or less. The specific value of `cost` will depend on the actual contents of the `sticks` list provided during execution. However, we can express `cost` formally given what's described.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `min_cost` is unchanged; `min_t` is unchanged; `i` is 101; `cost` is equal to `sum(min(abs(x - 101), abs(x - 100)) for x in sticks)**.
