The code snippet provided prints the values of `min_t` and `min_cost`, but does not modify any variables or perform calculations. The previous conditions regarding the values of `min_cost` and `min_t` remain valid. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values of these variables as they are printed, along with any conditions that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found, `min_t` is the corresponding value of `t` that minimized the cost**.
