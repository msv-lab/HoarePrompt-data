Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `mid` is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `mid - 1`; `i` is now `mid - 1`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is updated to `mid - 1`; otherwise, `min_cost` remains unchanged.***
