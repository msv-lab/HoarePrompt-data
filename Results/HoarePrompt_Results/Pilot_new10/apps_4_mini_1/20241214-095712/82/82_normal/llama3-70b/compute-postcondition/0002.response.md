Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b` and then dividing by the output of `func_1(a, b)`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is unknown based on this snippet, potential edge cases such as division by zero cannot be determined. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function would encounter a runtime error. **
