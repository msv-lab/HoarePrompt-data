The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `a` as the final GCD value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return their GCD, with special consideration that if `b` is 0, the GCD is `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a` as the GCD.**
