You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and identify potential issues.

The task is to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The program uses an infinite loop to increment \( k \) and continually check for the minimum LCM using the `func_2` which calculates the LCM of two numbers.

**Program Structure:**
1. It initializes \( k = 0 \).
2. It computes the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) as `min_lcm`.
3. A while loop checks the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) and compares it to `min_lcm`. If it finds a smaller LCM, it updates `min_lcm` and increments \( k \). The loop breaks when it finds no smaller LCM than the last.
4. Finally, the program prints \( k - 1 \).

**Issues and Potential Problems:**
1. The program starts with \( k = 0 \), but it prints \( k - 1 \) at the end. If \( k \) remains zero throughout the loop (because no smaller LCM is found), it results in printing `-1`, which doesn't align with the requirement that \( k \) should be non-negative.
2. The program potentially doesn't exhaustively check all possible values of \( k \) if LCM remains the same even when incrementing \( k \). It may miss optimal values unless the smallest LCM occurs right at a turning point before an increase in LCM.
3. The output of \( k \) should be the one where \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) yield the smallest LCM, not necessarily the last \( k \) checked before an increase.

**Test Case Example:** 
- Let's consider \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \).
  - \( k = 0 \): LCM(6, 10) = 30
  - \( k = 1 \): LCM(7, 11) = 77
  - \( k = 2 \): LCM(8, 12) = 24 (minimum found here)
  - \( k = 3 \): LCM(9, 13) = 117
  - The loop would break at \( k = 3 \), but the `print(k - 1)` would print `2`, which is correct. However, there could be other values of \( k \) explored beyond this point that might yield a smaller LCM.

- Consider \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \).
  - \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 1) = 1
  - Incrementing \( k \) only yields LCMs greater than 1, but any \( k \) after 0 would incorrectly return with a value of -1.

Due to these logical flaws, specifically the potential for invalid \( k \) values being returned and the logic regarding stopping criteria when searching for optimal \( k \), it is clear the program does not meet the problem requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. It continues to loop until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a` as the GCD. The function handles the input values constrained between 1 and \(10^9\) and correctly computes the GCD according to the Euclidean algorithm. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b` and then dividing by the output of `func_1(a, b)`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is unknown based on this snippet, potential edge cases such as division by zero cannot be determined. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function would encounter a runtime error. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
