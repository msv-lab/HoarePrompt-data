The calculation for `new_b` is assigned the value `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Given that `candidate` is equal to `diff`, the expression simplifies to `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `current_lcm` is less than or equal to `min_lcm`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `k` is 1, `new_a` is updated to `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `min_k` is set to `diff`, `candidate` is equal to `diff`**.
