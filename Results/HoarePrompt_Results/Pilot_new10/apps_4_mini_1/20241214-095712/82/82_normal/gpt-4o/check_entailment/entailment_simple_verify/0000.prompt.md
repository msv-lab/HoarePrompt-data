You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program has a logic flaw regarding the return value of the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) that achieves the smallest least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). The check for \( k \) values only considers divisors of the difference between \( a \) and \( b \) and does not correctly account for all possible values of \( k \), especially the edge case when \( k = 0 \). 

For instance, consider the example where \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \). Here, the expected output is \( k = 2 \) because the calculations provide an LCM of 24 when \( k = 2 \). However, if we examine \( k = 0 \), the program does not verify the LCM for \( a + 0 \) and \( b + 0 \) (which is \( \text{LCM}(6, 10) = 30 \)), and therefore may miss this as optimal unless explicitly handled. 

The program restricts the candidate \( k \) values to divisors derived from \( \text{abs}(a - b) \) but fails to check smaller values of \( k \) exhaustively, missing potential candidates which may yield a smaller LCM or guide towards the optimal solution. Therefore, it may not capture the correct answer in some cases. 

Thus, with the program not working correctly for the case when \( k = 0 \) was not checked thoroughly for the LCM, it confirms that the correctness is indeed false.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
