The variable `min_k` is assigned the value `candidate`. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. The Output State needs to reflect that `min_k` now holds the value of `candidate`, while preserving the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `k` is 1, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
