Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` has been assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
