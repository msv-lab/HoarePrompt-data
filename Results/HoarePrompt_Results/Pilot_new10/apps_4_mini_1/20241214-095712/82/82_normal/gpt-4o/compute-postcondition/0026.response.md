Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `k` is 1, `new_a` is updated to `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `min_k` is set to `diff`, `candidate` is equal to `diff`.**
