Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, then `min_lcm` is updated to the value of `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `candidate`. If `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to the value of `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, and `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated the same way. Otherwise, the values of `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged.***
