The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `abs(a - b)`. The values of `a` and `b` are both positive integers, and since `a` is not equal to `b`, `abs(a - b)` will yield a positive value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is the positive value `abs(a - b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is the positive value equal to `abs(a - b)`**.
