Correctness: **False**

The provided code attempts to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). However, there are logical errors in the implementation of `func_3` that can lead to incorrect results:

1. **Candidate Selection Mismanagement**: The code calculates potential candidates based on the divisors of the difference (`diff = abs(a - b)`) between the two numbers. The logic for choosing candidates is flawed as it only checks divisors up to the square root of `diff` without ensuring that all candidates yielding the minimum LCM are considered.

2. **LCM Calculation via `func_2`**: The implementation in `func_2` is based on the product of \( x \) and \( y \) divided by their GCD. However, if the GCD function `func_1` fails to correctly handle cases where the inputs yield a zero (an edge that should not be possible given \( a, b \geq 1 \)), it raises concerns regarding reliability.

3. **Handling of `k=0`**: The logic does not directly evaluate \( k = 0 \) initially to compare it with other candidates. The program should consider the case when \( k = 0 \) and compare the LCM efficiently, especially since \( a \) and \( b \) can have the same value, which should immediately return \( 0 \) as the answer.

4. **Example Discrepancy**: Consider \( a = 8, b = 12 \). The GCD is 4, and candidates can include \( k = 2, 4 \), but the logic does not correctly capture the conditions for candidates compared to just checking `k` values sequentially up to `diff` in order to directly evaluate LCM reductions.

Thus, due to these misunderstandings and miscalculations that can arise in the presence of specific inputs (like \( a = 8, b = 12 \) leading potentially to missing minimum cases), the code fails to guarantee the correctness across all scenarios defined in the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
