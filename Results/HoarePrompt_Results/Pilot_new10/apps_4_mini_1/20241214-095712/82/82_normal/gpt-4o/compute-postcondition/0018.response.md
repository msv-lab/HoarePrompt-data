The code assigns a new value to `new_b` based on the value of `b` and `candidate`, where `candidate` is equal to `diff`. As a result, `new_b` will be calculated as follows: 

`new_b = (b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`.

Since `b` is a positive integer and `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, this calculation will yield a new positive integer for `new_b`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `k` is set to 1, `new_b` is `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `candidate` is `diff // 1` (which is `diff`), `new_a` is `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`.**
