The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `previous_k`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions; `new_a` is computed as `(a + (abs(a - b) // k) - 1) // (abs(a - b) // k) * (abs(a - b) // k)`; `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions; `new_a` is computed as `(a + (abs(a - b) // k) - 1) // (abs(a - b) // k) * (abs(a - b) // k)`; `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
