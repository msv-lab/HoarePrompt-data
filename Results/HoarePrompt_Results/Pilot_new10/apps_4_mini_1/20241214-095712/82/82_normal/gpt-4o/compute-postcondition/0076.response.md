The value of `current_lcm` is assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, where `new_a` remains unchanged and `new_b` is determined by the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. As the initial conditions of `a` and `b` remain positive integers, `diff = abs(a - b)` is valid, and `candidate` is defined as `diff // k`. Thus, while the exact value of `current_lcm` isn't provided (as it depends on the implementation of `func_2`), we can maintain the relationships as stated.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` has been assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
