The variable `new_b` is assigned the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The value of `candidate` is `diff // k` and `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, we can express `new_b` in terms of `b` and `candidate`.

Other variables remain unaffected. Thus, we state that:

- `a` and `b` remain positive integers.
- `diff` is `abs(a - b)`.
- `previous_k` still satisfies the specified conditions.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.

Given that `candidate` is already defined, we can express `new_b` as `(b + diff // k - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
