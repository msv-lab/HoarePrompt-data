Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` holds the minimum least common multiple calculated from the candidates, `k` remains 1, `new_a` is calculated based on either the initial `k` or `diff // k`, `new_b` is determined likewise, `min_k` is set to the candidate that resulted in the minimum `min_lcm`, and `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` based on the candidates processed in the loop.**
