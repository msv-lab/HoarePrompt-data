The variable `new_a` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The prior values are `a`, `b`, and `candidate`, with `candidate` being the value of `diff // k`, where `diff` is `abs(a - b)`.

1. The variable `diff` is computed as `abs(a - b)`, which results in a non-negative integer since both `a` and `b` are positive integers.
2. `candidate` is calculated as `diff // k`, resulting in an integer.
3. The expression for `new_a` involves dividing `a + candidate - 1` by `candidate`, which effectively rounds down after adding `candidate - 1`. This ensures that any remainder when adding to `a` does not affect the floor division result.

The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, `previous_k`, and `k`) remain unchanged. 

The output state encapsulates the information regarding the unchanged variables and the newly computed value of `new_a`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**
