The variable `new_b` is assigned the value `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, which represents the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. Since `b` is a positive integer and `candidate` should also be a positive integer based on the context, `new_b` will also be a positive integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` holds the minimum least common multiple calculated from the candidates, `current_k` is at least 1, `k` can take values from `current_k` up to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `current_k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.**
