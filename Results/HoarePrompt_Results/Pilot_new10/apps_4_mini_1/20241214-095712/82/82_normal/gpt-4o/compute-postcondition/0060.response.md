The variable `new_b` is computed as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The value of `b` is positive and `candidate` is assumed to be a positive integer as well, resulting in `new_b` being set to the next multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. The other variables, including `a`, `diff`, and `previous_k`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the conditions given, `new_a` is computed as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`.**
