Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `k` is set to 1, `new_a` is updated to `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `min_k` is set to `diff`, and `current_lcm` is computed as the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.***
