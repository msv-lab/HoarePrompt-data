To evaluate the provided code snippet, we determine the impact of the function call `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` on the program state.

The `current_lcm` variable is assigned the result of the function `func_2` which takes `new_a` and `new_b` as parameters. However, we do not have information about how `new_a` is set in the initial state. The variables that have been explicitly defined are:

- `a`: a positive integer
- `b`: a positive integer
- `diff`: a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`
- `min_lcm`: equal to `float('inf')`
- `k`: initialized to 1
- `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`

The only variable being modified by the function call is `current_lcm`, which represents the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. Since we do not know the actual values of `new_a` and the result of `func_2`, the output state will reflect that `current_lcm` is now defined as the result of that function call.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`, `k` is 1, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
