Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, if `k` is a divisor of `diff`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` for all candidates checked, and `min_k` is the candidate associated with this minimum `min_lcm`. If no iterations occur, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged from their initial values.***
