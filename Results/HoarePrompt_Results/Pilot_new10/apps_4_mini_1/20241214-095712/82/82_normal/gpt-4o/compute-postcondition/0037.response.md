Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` holds the minimum least common multiple calculated from the candidates, `current_k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `k` can take values from `current_k` up to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and the value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (the value of `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and the value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`).***
