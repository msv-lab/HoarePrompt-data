Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
