The value of `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The previous values of `min_lcm`, `current_lcm`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `current_lcm` is now the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `new_a` is a positive multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.**
