According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over the values in the list `[k, diff // k]`. In this case, `candidate` takes on two values in the order they are in the list: first `k`, and then `diff // k`. 

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration specifies that `candidate` is less than `min_k`, we need to check the values of `candidate` on each iteration. The loop will execute if there are still values left in the list `[k, diff // k]`.

At the end of the last iteration, we can assume that `candidate` would have taken on its first value (`k`) during the first loop iteration. Now it is time for the second iteration where `candidate` would take on the second value, which is `diff // k`. 

Thus, the loop will execute one more time for `candidate` being equal to `diff // k`. 

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, current_lcm is less than min_lcm or equals min_lcm, min_lcm is updated to current_lcm, k is set to 1, new_a is updated to (a + diff - 1) // diff * diff, new_b is calculated as (b + diff - 1) // diff * diff, min_k is set to diff, candidate is equal to diff // k**
