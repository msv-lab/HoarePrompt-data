You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers where 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'y' is 0, 'x' is the GCD of the original values of 'x' and 'y'
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the GCD of the original values of x and y, where y is 0. Therefore, it essentially returns x, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function employs the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively replaces `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD. No edge cases are ignored, as the algorithm functions correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range of 1 to 10^9.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of the expression x * y divided by func_1(x, y), where x and y are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters, x and y (where 1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and returns the result of the expression x * y divided by the output of func_1(x, y). It is important to note that if func_1(x, y) returns zero, this would cause a division by zero error, which is not explicitly handled in the code provided. Thus, the functionality includes returning the result of the expression or encountering a division by zero error if func_1(x, y) is zero.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    if (a == b) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating that the values of `a` and `b`, although equal, do not affect the return value, which is a constant of 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`.
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if (current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate <
                    min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple obtained from valid candidates or `float('inf')` if no candidates were evaluated, and `min_k` is the candidate associated with `min_lcm` or 0 if no candidates were considered.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k, which is the candidate associated with the minimum least common multiple, or 0 if no candidates were considered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns 0 if they are equal; otherwise, it returns the candidate associated with the minimum least common multiple of modified `a` and `b`, or 0 if no valid candidates are considered.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
