Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`, `k` is 1, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
