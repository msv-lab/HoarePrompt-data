The function accepts two positive integer parameters, x and y (where 1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and returns the result of the expression x * y divided by the output of func_1(x, y). It is important to note that if func_1(x, y) returns zero, this would cause a division by zero error, which is not explicitly handled in the code provided. Thus, the functionality includes returning the result of the expression or encountering a division by zero error if func_1(x, y) is zero.
