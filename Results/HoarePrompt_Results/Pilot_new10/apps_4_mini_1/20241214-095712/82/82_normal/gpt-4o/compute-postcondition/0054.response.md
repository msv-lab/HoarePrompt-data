Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `new_a` is a positive multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`.***
