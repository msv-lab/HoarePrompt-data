To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and identify potential issues.

The task is to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The program uses an infinite loop to increment \( k \) and continually check for the minimum LCM using the `func_2` which calculates the LCM of two numbers.

**Program Structure:**
1. It initializes \( k = 0 \).
2. It computes the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) as `min_lcm`.
3. A while loop checks the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) and compares it to `min_lcm`. If it finds a smaller LCM, it updates `min_lcm` and increments \( k \). The loop breaks when it finds no smaller LCM than the last.
4. Finally, the program prints \( k - 1 \).

**Issues and Potential Problems:**
1. The program starts with \( k = 0 \), but it prints \( k - 1 \) at the end. If \( k \) remains zero throughout the loop (because no smaller LCM is found), it results in printing `-1`, which doesn't align with the requirement that \( k \) should be non-negative.
2. The program potentially doesn't exhaustively check all possible values of \( k \) if LCM remains the same even when incrementing \( k \). It may miss optimal values unless the smallest LCM occurs right at a turning point before an increase in LCM.
3. The output of \( k \) should be the one where \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) yield the smallest LCM, not necessarily the last \( k \) checked before an increase.

**Test Case Example:** 
- Let's consider \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \).
  - \( k = 0 \): LCM(6, 10) = 30
  - \( k = 1 \): LCM(7, 11) = 77
  - \( k = 2 \): LCM(8, 12) = 24 (minimum found here)
  - \( k = 3 \): LCM(9, 13) = 117
  - The loop would break at \( k = 3 \), but the `print(k - 1)` would print `2`, which is correct. However, there could be other values of \( k \) explored beyond this point that might yield a smaller LCM.

- Consider \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \).
  - \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 1) = 1
  - Incrementing \( k \) only yields LCMs greater than 1, but any \( k \) after 0 would incorrectly return with a value of -1.

Due to these logical flaws, specifically the potential for invalid \( k \) values being returned and the logic regarding stopping criteria when searching for optimal \( k \), it is clear the program does not meet the problem requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
