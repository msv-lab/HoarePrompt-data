The statement `high = mid - 1` assigns a new value to the variable `high`. The previous value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, so `high` becomes `(low + high + 1) // 2 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v, `high` is now equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2 - 1`.**
