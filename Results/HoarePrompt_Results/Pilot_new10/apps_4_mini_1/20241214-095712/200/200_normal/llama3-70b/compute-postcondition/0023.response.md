Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, and `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`, while `high` remains unchanged, and `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while `low` remains less than `high`, and `total` continues to be the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`.***
