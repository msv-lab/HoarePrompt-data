Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `low` is 0, `high` is `min(v)`, `mid` is `(min(v) + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of min(`mid`, `x`) for each `x` in `v`. The current value of `total` is less than `s`.***
