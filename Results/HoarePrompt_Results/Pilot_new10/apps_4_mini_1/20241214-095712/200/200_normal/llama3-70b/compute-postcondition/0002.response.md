The code `v.sort()` sorts the list `v` in place in ascending order. The initial values of `n`, `s`, and the list `v` remain unchanged except for the order of elements in `v`. Since `v` contains `n` positive integers, the content of `v` will now be in sorted order. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers.**
