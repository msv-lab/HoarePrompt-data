Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, and `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `(min(v) + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is 0, `high` is `(min(v) + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `mid` remains `(min(v) + 1) // 2`, while `total` is greater than or equal to `s.***
