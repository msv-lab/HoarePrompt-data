The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the nearest enclosing loop and move to the next iteration. Since this statement does not modify the values of any variables, the output state will reflect that there has been no change in those variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, and the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume` (no change in variable values)**
