You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze its behavior and identify potential edge cases.

1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The program first reads the number of kegs `n` and the desired volume `s`.
   - It reads the volumes of each keg into a list and calculates the total kvass available.
   - If the total kvass is less than `s`, it prints `-1`.
   - It then sorts the keg volumes and attempts to ensure that the minimum keg volume is maintained after pouring `s` liters total. It does this by trying to take kvass starting from the kegs with larger volumes.

2. **Key Flaw in the Logic**:
   - After taking as much as possible without reducing the minimum keg below the starting minimum, if there is still kvass left to take, it reduces the minimum by an average calculation based on `remaining_kvass`.
   - This approach may not correctly account for situations where redistributing the remaining amount would allow the minimum keg to be higher than calculated. Specifically, the adjustment of `min_keg_volume` doesn't consider that total kvass can be distributed unevenly while still maintaining a higher level in the minimum keg.

3. **Test Case to Consider**:
   - Let’s consider the case `n = 3`, `s = 5`, and the keg volumes `[2, 2, 10]`.
     - Here the total kvass is `2 + 2 + 10 = 14`, which is greater than `s`.
     - The current minimum is `2`, and we can take `2` liters from the first two kegs, resulting in their values becoming `0` and `0`, and taking `1` liter from the third keg resulting in its value becoming `9`.
     - The minimum keg volume would still be `0`, which violates the expected logic where the output should reflect at least some kvass remaining in the kegs more uniformly, if possible.

From the analysis, it is clear that the program may return incorrect results for certain configurations of keg volumes and desired pouring amounts.

**Correctness: False**.  
The provided example demonstrates a scenario where the calculated minimum keg volume does not reflect the logic prescribed in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i (1 <= v_i <= 10^9) represents the volume of the i-th keg.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if sufficient kvass was taken) or is reduced from the original value of `s` by the minimum of the effective volumes taken, `i` is equal to the count of valid `volumes` processed before remaining_kvass becomes 0 or all iterations complete, and all unprocessed kegs were less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` from its previous value, and `i` is equal to the count of valid `volumes` processed before `remaining_kvass` becomes 0 or all iterations complete.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, and `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list. If the `total_volume` is less than `s`, the function outputs -1. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` is updated based on `remaining_kvass`, and `i` equals the count of valid `volumes` processed before `remaining_kvass` becomes 0 or all iterations complete, followed by printing the value of `min_keg_volume`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
