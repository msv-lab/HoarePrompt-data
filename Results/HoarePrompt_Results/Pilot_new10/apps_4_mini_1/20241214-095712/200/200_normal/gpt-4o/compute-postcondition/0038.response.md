Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, and `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list. If the `total_volume` is less than `s`, the function outputs -1. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` is updated based on `remaining_kvass`, and `i` equals the count of valid `volumes` processed before `remaining_kvass` becomes 0 or all iterations complete, followed by printing the value of `min_keg_volume`.***
