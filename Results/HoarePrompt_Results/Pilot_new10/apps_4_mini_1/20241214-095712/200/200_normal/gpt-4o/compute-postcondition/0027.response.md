The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop (such as a for loop or while loop) and proceed to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of `n` or `i` in the current context since we do not have visibility into the overall loop structure they are a part of. 

Given that `n` is in the range of 1 to 1000 and must be greater than 2, and `i` is set to 2, there are no changes to these variables as a result of executing `continue`. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variable values have changed but conveys the control flow action of continuing to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
