The code `print(years)` outputs the value of `years`, which is currently 3. The variable `years` is not modified by the print statement. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the values of the variables stay the same except for validating that `years` is printed.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`, `years` is 3, `b` is between 8 and 80, `a` is between 27 and 270, and the value of `years` (3) has been printed.**
