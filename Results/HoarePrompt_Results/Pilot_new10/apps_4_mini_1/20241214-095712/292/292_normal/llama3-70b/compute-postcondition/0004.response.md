`b` is multiplied by 2. Since `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10, the new value of `b` will be between 2 and 20. The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is between 3 and 30, `b` is between 2 and 20, `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is between 3 and 30, `b` is between 2 and 20, `years` is 0**
