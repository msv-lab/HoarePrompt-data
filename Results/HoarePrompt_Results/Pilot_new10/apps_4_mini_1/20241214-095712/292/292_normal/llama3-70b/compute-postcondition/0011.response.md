The variable `a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` must be less than or equal to 40, after the operation, `a` will be a value between 0 and 40. Specifically, `a` will now be a value less than or equal to 120 (since `3 * 40 = 120`). However, because `a` must remain less than or equal to 40, the final result will still respect that constraint. The other variables `b` and `years` remain unchanged in this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is now equal to `3 * a` (which must still be less than or equal to 40), `b` is between 4 and 40, `years` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is now equal to `3 * a` (which must still be less than or equal to 40), `b` is between 4 and 40, `years` is 2**
