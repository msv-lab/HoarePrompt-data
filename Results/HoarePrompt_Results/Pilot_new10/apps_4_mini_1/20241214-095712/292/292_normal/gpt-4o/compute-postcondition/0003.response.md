The variable `a` is multiplied by 3, impacting its value. Since `a` is an integer and 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, the new value of `a` will be a number in the range [3, 30]. The value of `b` and `years` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a value in the range [3, 30], `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, `years` is 0**.
