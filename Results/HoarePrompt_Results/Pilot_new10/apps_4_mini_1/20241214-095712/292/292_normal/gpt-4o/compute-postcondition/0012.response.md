The value of `b` is multiplied by 2, but the initial value of `b` is not specified, only that it must be at least 9. Therefore, after doubling, `b` will be at least 18. The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is in the range [27, 270]; `b` is at least 18; `years` is 2**
