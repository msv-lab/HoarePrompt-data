The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. Since no output behavior is provided, we cannot determine the specific return values from the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` which are constrained to the range 1 to 10, with `a` being less than or equal to `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both integers constrained between 1 and 10, with `a` less than or equal to `b`.**
