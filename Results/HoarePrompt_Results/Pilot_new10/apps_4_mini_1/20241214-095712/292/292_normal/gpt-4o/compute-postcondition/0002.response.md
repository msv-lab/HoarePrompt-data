According to the code, the loop can execute if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Since the current state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers with the constraint 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, and `years` is 0, we should examine the values of `a` and `b`.

Given that `years` doesn't affect the loop execution, we focus on `a` and `b`. Since it's stated that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, the loop can execute as long as `a` is still less than or equal to `b`. 

Since we do not have specific values for `a` and `b`, they could currently meet the conditions necessary for the loop's execution. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to `a` and `b` as they already satisfy the required condition (1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10).

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, `years` is 0**
