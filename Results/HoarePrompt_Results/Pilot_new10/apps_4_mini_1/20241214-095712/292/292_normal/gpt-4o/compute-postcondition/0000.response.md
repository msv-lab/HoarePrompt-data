`a` and `b` are assigned new integer values through the input operation. Since `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, the values of `a` and `b` can now be any integers within this range based on the user input. The previous conditions remain valid but with `a` and `b` updated.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers with new values according to input, such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10.**
