To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down what the program attempts to accomplish.

The program is supposed to:

1. Compute `f_max(n)`, which is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of integers `1` through `n`.
2. Count the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p) = f_max(n)`.
3. Return this count modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Analyzing the program:

1. **Function Definitions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2(n)`: This function is supposed to calculate `f_max(n)` correctly. However, the way it calculates the maximum GCD from the sequence of integers `1` to `n` is flawed. The use of GCD by successively checking `func_1(res, i)` does not yield the maximum distinct values of GCDs computed from permutations.
   - `func_3(n, f_max_n)`: This function should count the number of permutations that result in `f(p) = f_max(n)`, but its logic depends on the correctness of `func_2`.

2. **Key Missing Logic:**
   - The main issue lies with `func_2`: it does not actually compute `f_max(n)` in a meaningful way that correlates with possible distinct GCDs resulting from permutations. The value returned may not reflect `f_max(n)` for larger values of `n`.
   - For example, according to the problem statement, distinct elements from the GCD computations cannot consistently evaluate to possible values depending on different values of `n`.

### Testing Against Key Cases:
Let's consider an example case:

For `n = 4`, the following permutations are possible:  
- `1, 2, 3, 4` has `f(p) = 1`.  
- Permutations like `2, 1, 3, 4` compute different prefixes resulting in potentially higher distinct values, but these cannot be accurately calculated as the functions are implemented.

The results in the output will be heavily impacted by the incorrect behavior in `func_2`.

Thus, we have a situation where the program fails for at least some inputs since `func_2(n)` fails to determine the correct value of `f_max(n)`.

### Conclusion:
Based on this analysis, I can conclude the following:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program contains errors in the calculation of `f_max(n)` and does not correctly enumerate permutations with distinct GCD values, especially beyond basic cases such as `n = 2` and `n = 3`. The logic for `f_2` leads to incorrect results.
