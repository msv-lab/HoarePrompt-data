To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and compare it against the requirement of counting the permutations that yield the maximum value of \( f(p) \).

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) which represents the number of permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Special Case for \( n = 2 \)**: If \( n \) is 2, the program directly returns 1. This is consistent with the expected output since the permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] yield \( f(p) = 1 \) and the maximum value \( f_{max}(2) = 1 \).
3. **For \( n > 2 \)**: The program computes the result by calling `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`, which calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) under modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). However, the code lacks the necessary logic to analyze how many permutations yield this maximum \( f(p) \).

### Key Requirement:
The problem defines \( f(p) \) which is characterized by the number of distinct GCD values for the prefixes of the permutation. To truly solve the problem, the code must:
- Identify the maximum \( f_{max}(n) \) for a given \( n \).
- Count permutations that achieve that maximum \( f(p) \).

### Issues with the Current Implementation:
- **Calculating Only Factorial**: The code, as written, only computes the factorial of \( n-1 \) and does not account for the distinct maximum GCD values nor the count of permutations that achieve this maximum.
- **Missing Logic for \( f(p) \)**: The implementation fails to actually evaluate different permutations and their corresponding GCD prefixes to determine \( f(p) \).

### Example Case:
Let's take the case of \( n = 4 \):
- The maximum distinct GCD values \( f_{max}(4) \) is determined by analyzing permutations like \([4, 3, 2, 1]\), which would yield \( f(p) = 3 \) based on the prefixes. However, the implemented logic does not calculate or count these permutations correctly.
  
Based on the above evaluation, we can see that:
1. The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case since we can think of cases, such as \( n = 4 \) or \( n = 5 \), where it does not yield the correct number of permutations achieving the maximum \( f(p) \).
2. There are clear gaps between the specified requirements and what the current program implements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not comprehensively account for the logic necessary to match the problem's requirements, specifically the true calculation of permutations that yield \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).
