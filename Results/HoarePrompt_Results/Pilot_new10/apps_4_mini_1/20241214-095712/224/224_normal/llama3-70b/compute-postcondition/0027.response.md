The statement `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that the initial state specifies that `j` is initialized to `f_max_n`, this means the operation modifies `dp[f_max_n]`. The affected states are as follows:

- `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`.

The other variables, including `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`, `i`, and `j`, do not change with respect to this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[j]` and other unchanged conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` retains its initial value, `dp[j]` (now `dp[f_max_n]`) is updated to `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `f_max_n`.**
