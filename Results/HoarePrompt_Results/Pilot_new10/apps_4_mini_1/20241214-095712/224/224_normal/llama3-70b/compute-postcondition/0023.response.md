The code updates `dp[j]` by taking the modulus of `dp[j]` after it has been added to `dp[j - 1]`. The variable `dp[j]` will be assigned the value `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, and since it is then performed a modulus operation with `MOD`, the new value will be `dp[j] % MOD`.

The values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain unchanged, but `dp[j]` will now be updated based on the new calculation while ensuring it wraps around with the modulus operation.

The Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is 2; `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.
