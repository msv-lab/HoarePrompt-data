According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `f_max_n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented to `f_max_n - 2` and we need to ensure that `f_max_n` is greater than 1 for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` retains its initial value; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD; `i` is `n + 1`; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`**
