The code snippet modifies `dp[j]` by applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The variable `dp[j]` was previously calculated as `dp[j]_prev + dp[j - 1]`, and now it is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`. This operation will ensure that `dp[j]` remains within the range defined by `MOD`.

The variables `n`, `f_max_n`, `dp[0]`, and `dp[1]` remain unchanged according to the preconditions, while the value of `dp[j]` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` retains its initial value; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j]_prev + dp[j - 1] % 1000000007; `i` is `n + 1`; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.**
