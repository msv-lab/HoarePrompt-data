You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0, which means the GCD is `a` itself.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is equal to the maximum value obtained from calling `func_1` for each integer from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the maximum value obtained from calling func_1 for each integer from 1 to n, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n >= 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is `n`; for `j` from `2` to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` contains the cumulative sums based on the dynamic programming relation.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the cumulative sum at index f_max_n in the dp array, which is computed based on the dynamic programming relation and contains the cumulative sums with initial values dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = n for positive integer n such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
