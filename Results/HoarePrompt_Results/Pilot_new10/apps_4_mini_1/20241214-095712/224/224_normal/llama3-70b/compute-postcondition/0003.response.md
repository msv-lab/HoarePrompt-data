In the provided code, the execution of the for loop is dependent on the variable `i`, which will iterate from 1 to `n`, inclusive. Here are the key points to consider for the execution of the loop:

1. The value of `n` is already established as a positive integer within the range 2 to 10^6, which ensures that the range for `i` is valid.
2. The initial value of `i` will start at 1, as specified by the range.
3. The loop will execute for `n` iterations, starting from `i = 1` through `i = n`.

The current state specifies `n` is a positive integer, which guarantees that the loop will indeed execute at least once. The initial value of `i` is implicitly managed by the `range` function.

Thus, the state requires no fundamental adjustments as it currently allows for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1**
