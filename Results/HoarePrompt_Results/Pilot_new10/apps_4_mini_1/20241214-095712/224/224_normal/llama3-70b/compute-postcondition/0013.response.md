Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1.

After executing the loop for `f_max_n` times, the values of the variables and their relationships will be as follows:

- `n` remains as a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `MOD` is 1000000007.
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` will be updated based on the relation `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` executed over the range from `f_max_n` down to 1, meaning:
  - `dp[1]` becomes `dp[1] + dp[0]`, which is 1.
  - `dp[2]` becomes `dp[2] + dp[1]`, and so on, up to `dp[f_max_n]` where each entry is dependent on the value of the previous index.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` will ultimately become 0 after all iterations are done, as it decreases from `f_max_n` to 1.

Thus, the final output state reflects the updated `dp` array and the status of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is 1, and `dp[2]` to `dp[f_max_n]` will contain the cumulative sums based on the dynamic programming relation, `i` is 1, `j` is 0.**
