According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `f_max_n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than 0, starting from `f_max_n` and decrementing by 1 in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to `f_max_n`, and it must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, before the next iteration starts, `j` should be `f_max_n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` remains 0**
