The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` when divided by `MOD`. This means that `dp[j]` will now be within the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is 1; and `dp[0]` remains 1 after the operation. The output will reflect the new value of `dp[j]` after the modulus operation but does not specify its previous value or whether it has changed based on conditions provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is 1; `dp[0]` remains 1; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % 1000000007`.**
