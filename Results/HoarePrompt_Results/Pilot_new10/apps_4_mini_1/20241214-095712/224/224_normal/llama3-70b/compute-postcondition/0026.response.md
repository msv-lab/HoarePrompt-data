According to the code, the for loop will iterate from `f_max_n` down to `1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Based on the given state before the loop starts:
- `n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^6), so its value does not directly affect the execution of the loop.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
- `MOD` is a constant and does not affect loop execution.
- `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` retains its initial value; this sets up the initial conditions for the loop.
- The variable `i` is initialized to `n + 1`, which does not influence the loop execution directly but may be relevant in the context of the code inside the loop.

Thus, the necessary conditions involve ensuring that `f_max_n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. As the loop starts from `f_max_n`, we also confirm that `j` will be initialized to `f_max_n`, which should also be at least 1:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` retains its initial value, `dp[j]` for `j` from `2` to `f_max_n` contains the cumulative sums based on prior `dp` values, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is initialized to `f_max_n` which must be at least 1**
