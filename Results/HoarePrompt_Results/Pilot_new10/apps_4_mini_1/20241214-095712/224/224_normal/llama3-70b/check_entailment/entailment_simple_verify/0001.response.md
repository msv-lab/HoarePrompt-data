Based on my analysis of the problem description, the program provided, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I maintain the original assessment of the program's correctness.

The original assessment correctly highlighted that `func_2(n)` is flawed because it does not calculate the maximum value of `f(p)` as intended. Instead, it calculates the GCD of integers from 1 to `n`, which will always return 1 for any input `n >= 2`. This misuse leads to both the wrong assumption about `f_max(n)` and incorrect behavior in subsequent computations in `func_3(n, f_max_n)`.

Looking at the annotated version of the code just confirms the assessment. At no point is there a calculation for how many distinct GCD values can result from permutations of numbers from `1` to `n`. Without this measure, the main logic behind the program fails to meet the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate because it fundamentally identifies that the program will not function correctly for inputs greater than 2, thereby not fulfilling the requirements of the problem.

Final: **False**
