Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the required value as specified in the problem description. To illustrate the issue, let's analyze the functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)** is implemented correctly for computing the GCD of two integers. However, it doesn't handle the edge case when both inputs are zero, leading to an infinite loop. While this may not directly influence the overall output, it reflects poor completeness in code robustness.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)** attempts to calculate `f_max_n`, but it does not properly implement the logic needed to determine the maximum value of `f(p)` from permutations, as there are no checks or logic that considers distinct elements or how permutations affect distinct GCD values.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)** is set up as a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of valid permutations, but since the value of `f_max_n` derived from `func_2` is not correct, this function's output will also be erroneous. Moreover, the description states that `f_max_n` needs to be evaluated adequately with respect to distinct prefix GCDs, and since `func_2` fails to do that, all subsequent logic is based on incorrect input.

In summary, the logic for determining the maximum distinct GCD values from the gcd prefixes across all permutations is improperly handled or missing altogether, leading to wrong or incomplete outputs, especially in cases of larger `n`. 

For example, for `n = 3`, `f_max(3) = 2`, but the naive logic used in `func_2` would not reach this conclusion adequately, thus resulting in miscounting resulting permutations in `func_3`. 

Therefore, given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
