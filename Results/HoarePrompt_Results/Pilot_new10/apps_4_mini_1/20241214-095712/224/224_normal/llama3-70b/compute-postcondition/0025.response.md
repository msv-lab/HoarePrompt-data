According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate for `i` starting from 1 up to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 with each loop iteration, after the last iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be `n + 1`, and we need to ensure that `n` is still a positive integer within the specified constraints. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` retains its value from the initial state; `dp[j]` for `j` from `2` to `f_max_n` contains the cumulative sums based on prior `dp` values updated in accordance with the loop; `i` is `n + 1`**
