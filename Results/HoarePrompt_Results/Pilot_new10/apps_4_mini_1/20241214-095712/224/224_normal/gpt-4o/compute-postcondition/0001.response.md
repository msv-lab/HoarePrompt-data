According to the code, the loop executes for `i` ranging from 2 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, the starting point `i` must be at least 2, which is guaranteed by the given range since `n` is at least 2. 

1. The variable `i` will start at 2 when the loop begins.
2. `n` is given as an integer within the range of 2 to 10^6, which ensures that the loop will iterate through at least the values 2 and 3.
3. The value of `result` at the start of the loop is 1, which does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, before the loop starts:

- The variable `i` will be initialized as 2, and
- The maximum value `i` can reach will be `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7, `result` is 1, `i` is 2**
