According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 2 and going up to `n`. In this case, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be 4, and we also need to ensure that the value of `n` remains within the range of 3 to 10^6.

Since `n` is already within the specified bounds (3 <= n <= 10^6), we just need to make the adjustment to `i`. The condition to keep looping is that `i` should remain less than or equal to `n`. In this case, if `i` is incremented to 4, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7; `result` is 6; `i` is 4**
