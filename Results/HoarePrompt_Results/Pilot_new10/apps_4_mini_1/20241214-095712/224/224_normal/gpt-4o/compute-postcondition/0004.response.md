To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we perform the following steps:

1. Evaluate the impact of the code on the program. In the code provided, `result` is updated by multiplying it with `i` and then taking the modulo with `mod`.
2. Previous values are `result = 2`, `i = 3`, and `mod = 10^9 + 7`.
3. Calculate the new value of `result` using the formula: `result = result * i % mod`.
   - Plugging in the values: `result = 2 * 3 % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - This simplifies to `result = 6 % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - Since `6` is less than `10^9 + 7`, the result is `6`.

After executing the code, the value of `result` has changed, while the other variables remain the same.

Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7; `result` is 6; `i` is 3**
