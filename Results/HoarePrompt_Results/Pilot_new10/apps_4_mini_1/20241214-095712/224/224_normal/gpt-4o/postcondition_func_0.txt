The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer within the range 2 to 10^6) and `mod` (an integer equal to 10^9 + 7), and returns the computed value of `n! % (10^9 + 7)`. The annotations correctly indicate that the function computes the factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`, and since `n` is guaranteed to be in the specified range, there are no edge cases to consider within the provided constraints.
