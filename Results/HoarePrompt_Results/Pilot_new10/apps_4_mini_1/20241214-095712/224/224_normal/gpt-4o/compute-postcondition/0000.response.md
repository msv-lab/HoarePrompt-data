The variable `result` is assigned the value 1. The initial state of `n` as an integer (2 <= n <= 10^6) and `mod` as 10^9 + 7 remain unchanged since they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7, and `result` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7, and `result` is 1.**
