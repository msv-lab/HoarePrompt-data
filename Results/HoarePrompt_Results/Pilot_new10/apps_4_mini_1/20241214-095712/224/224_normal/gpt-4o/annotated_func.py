#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and mod is an integer which is equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7; `result` is equal to `n! % mod; i` will be `n`.
    return result
    #The program returns the result which is equal to n! % (10^9 + 7), where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer within the range 2 to 10^6) and `mod` (an integer equal to 10^9 + 7), and returns the computed value of `n! % (10^9 + 7)`. The annotations correctly indicate that the function computes the factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`, and since `n` is guaranteed to be in the specified range, there are no edge cases to consider within the provided constraints.
