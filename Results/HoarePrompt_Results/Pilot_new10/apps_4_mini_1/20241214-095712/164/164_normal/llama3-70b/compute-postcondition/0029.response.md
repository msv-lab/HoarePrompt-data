Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in the string `s`, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in the string `s`, both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k` and all indices from `g` to `t` with a step of `k` contain elements in string `s` that are not equal to '#', the output 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is not divisible by `k`, or if there exists an index `i` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#' for some valid `i`, the output 'NO' is printed.***
