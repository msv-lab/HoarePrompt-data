According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100. This means `n` is at least 2, allowing the loop to execute again.

For the next iteration, the value of `i` will increment by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. The next iteration will use this updated value of `i`. The variable `n` will remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2**
