The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and a `string`. Here, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and n-1, and the `string` is of length `n`, which contains exactly one 'G' (representing the starting point), one 'T' (representing the target point), and the remaining characters are either '.' (empty cells) or '#' (obstacles). The function processes these inputs and outputs a result based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' and their relationship to the obstacles. 

Since the specific output conditions have not been provided, I will outline the functionality based on the input parameter definitions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 2 and 100), `k` (an integer between 1 and n-1), and a `string` of length n containing exactly one 'G', one 'T', and other characters representing empty cells or obstacles.**
