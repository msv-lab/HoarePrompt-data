The code is designed to take input values for `n` and `k`. `n` must be between 2 and 100, while `k` must be between 1 and `n-1`. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` and `k` will have specific integer values based on the input. The conditions dictating their ranges remain intact since they are enforced by the initial state description.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, both assigned values from the input.**
