Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is 'G', then `g` is set to 1. If `s[1]` is 'T', then `t` is set to 1 and `g` remains unchanged since 'G' is not the case. In all other cases where `s[1]` is neither 'G' nor 'T', `g` is set to 0 and `t` is also set to 0.***
