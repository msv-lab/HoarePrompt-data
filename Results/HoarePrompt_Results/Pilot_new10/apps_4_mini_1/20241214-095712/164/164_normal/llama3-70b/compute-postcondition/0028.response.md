Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in the string `s`, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in the string `s`, both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1, indicating that both 'G' and 'T' occur in the string `s`, and the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is not divisible by `k`, or there exists an index `i` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#' for some valid `i`, in the range of `abs(t - g) // k + 1`; the output is 'NO'.**
