The variable `s` is assigned the value from `input()`, which allows the user to enter a string. The values of the other variables, `n` and `k`, remain unchanged, as they do not interact with `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the original conditions for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`; `s` is an input string.**
