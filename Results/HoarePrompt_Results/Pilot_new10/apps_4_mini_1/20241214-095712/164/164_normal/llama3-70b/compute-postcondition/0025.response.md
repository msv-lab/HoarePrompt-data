Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in the string `s`, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in the string `s`, both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1. The absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and for all indices from `g` to `t` with a step of `k`, the corresponding elements in string `s` are not equal to '#'.***
