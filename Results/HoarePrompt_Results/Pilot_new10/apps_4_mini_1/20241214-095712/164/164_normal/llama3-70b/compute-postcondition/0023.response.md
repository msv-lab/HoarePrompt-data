The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, `n`, `g`, `t`, and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. The output simply indicates that 'NO' was printed, but the existing conditions involving `g` and `t` still hold true. Thus, the output state retains the details about `n`, `g`, `t`, and `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in the string `s` or -1 if 'G' does not occur, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in the string `s` or -1 if 'T' does not occur, `s` is the input string. The string 'NO' has been printed.**
