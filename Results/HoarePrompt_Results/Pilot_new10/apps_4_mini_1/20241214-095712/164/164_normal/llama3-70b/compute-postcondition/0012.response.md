The value of `g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The previous conditions related to `s[1]` do not affect this assignment directly since we're only updating `g`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, meaning `n` is still an integer between 2 and 100, and `i` remains 1. The values of `g`, `t`, and `s` still depend on previous conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `g` is 1.**
