The variable `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is not equal to 'G', the current value of `s[i]` is 'T', and `t` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is not equal to 'G', the current value of `s[i]` is 'T', and `t` is 0**.
