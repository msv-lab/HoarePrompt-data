Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is equal to `G_pos + k`, `pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, and if `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement while keeping `reachable` unchanged.***
