The value of `reachable` is assigned `False`. The other variables are not directly affected by this assignment, so the output state will remain the same for `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, and `T_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string obtained from input, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are indices of 'G' and 'T' in `line` respectively, `reachable` is False.**
