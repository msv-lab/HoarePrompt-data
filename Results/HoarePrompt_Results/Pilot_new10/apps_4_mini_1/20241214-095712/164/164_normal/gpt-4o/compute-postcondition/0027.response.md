Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is equal to `G_pos + 2k`, `pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`. If `pos` equals `T_pos`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, there is no else case to consider.***
