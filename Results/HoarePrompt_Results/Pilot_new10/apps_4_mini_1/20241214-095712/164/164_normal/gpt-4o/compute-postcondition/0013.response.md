The initial state indicates that `reachable` is initially set to True but remains unchanged by the executed code. As a result, there are no changes to `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, or `T_pos`. The only variable that was set in the code snippet is `reachable`, which is already True. 

Therefore, no variables have been changed by the code execution, and all the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is equal to `G_pos`, and the current value of `pos` is equal to `T_pos`.**
