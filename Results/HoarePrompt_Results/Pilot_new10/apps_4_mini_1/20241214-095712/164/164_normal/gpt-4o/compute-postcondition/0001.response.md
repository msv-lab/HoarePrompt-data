The variable `line` is assigned the value from `input()`, which represents a string input from the user. The initial values of `n` and `k` are not changed, so they remain within their specified bounds. Therefore, the relevant precondition states remain unchanged for `n` and `k`, while `line` is now a string obtained from the user's input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string obtained from input.**
