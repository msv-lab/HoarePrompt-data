The variable `T_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the character 'T' in the string `line`. The existing states of `n`, `k`, and `G_pos` remain unchanged, and a new variable, `T_pos`, is introduced based on the string `line`. The output will reflect that `T_pos` holds the index where 'T' is located in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string obtained from input, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`.**
