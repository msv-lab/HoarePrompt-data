The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is `G_pos`. The character at the position `pos` in `line` is '#', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
