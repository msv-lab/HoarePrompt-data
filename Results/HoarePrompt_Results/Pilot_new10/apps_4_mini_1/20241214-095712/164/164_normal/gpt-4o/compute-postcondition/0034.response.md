The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and an integer `k`, along with a string `s` of length `n`. The parameter `n` represents the number of cells and must satisfy the constraint (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). The parameter `k` represents the length of one grasshopper's jump and must satisfy the constraint (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1). The string `s` consists of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' denotes the grasshopper's starting position, 'T' denotes the target position, '.' represents empty cells, and '#' represents obstacles. After executing the function body, based on the positions of 'G', 'T', and obstacles, the function determines whether the grasshopper can reach the target position. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to assess whether a grasshopper, starting from position 'G' and jumping a specified length `k`, can reach the target 'T' while navigating around obstacles represented by '#'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer representing the number of cells), k (integer representing the length of one grasshopper's jump), and s (a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'). It returns whether the grasshopper can reach the target 'T' from 'G' by jumping `k` cells without hitting any obstacles ('#').**
