According to the code, the next execution of the loop depends on the values of `pos`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `pos` equal to `G_pos`, which is less than or equal to `T_pos`, and since `k` is a positive integer, `pos` will be increased by `k` during the next iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, `pos` should be adjusted to be `G_pos + k`. For the loop to execute again, `pos` must still be less than or equal to `T_pos`. Therefore, we need to update the state accordingly:

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is equal to `G_pos + k`, and `pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`.**
