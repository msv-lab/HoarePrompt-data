Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the grasshopper can reach the insect based on the specified jump length and the presence of obstacles. It does the following:

1. It first identifies the positions of the grasshopper ('G') and the target ('T'), ensuring they are in the correct order by swapping if necessary.
2. It then iterates from the grasshopper's position towards the target's position in increments of `k`, checking if there are any obstacles ('#') along the way.
3. If it encounters an obstacle, it breaks out of the loop. If it reaches the target position during iteration, it sets the `reachable` flag to `True`.
4. Finally, it outputs 'YES' if reachable and 'NO' if not.

The code handles all potential edge cases outlined in the problem description, adhering to the input constraints. All cases in the provided examples correctly return the expected results. Therefore, there are no scenarios where the program violates the described behavior.
