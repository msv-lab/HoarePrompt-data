The code initializes a list called `visited` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. The previous values of `n`, `p`, `b`, and `data` remain unchanged; only `visited` is affected.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from `data[1:n + 1]`; `b` is a list of integers converted from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`; `data` is a list of strings from input split by whitespace; `visited` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`.**
