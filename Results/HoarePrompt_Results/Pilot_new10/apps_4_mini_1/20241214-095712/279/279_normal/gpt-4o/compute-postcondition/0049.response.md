`cycle` is updated to include the value of `x`, which is 2. Therefore, `cycle` now contains the element 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `visited[2] is True;` `cycle` is a list containing the element 2; `x` is 2; `cycles` remains unchanged.**
