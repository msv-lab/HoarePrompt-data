The variable `cycle` is initialized as an empty list, meaning that the previous state of `cycle`, which may have contained some elements, is now reset. The other variables `n`, `i`, `visited`, `x`, and `cycles` remain unchanged and are still valid. The Output State reflects that `cycle` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `visited` remains unchanged, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` remains unchanged, `cycles` remains unchanged**.
