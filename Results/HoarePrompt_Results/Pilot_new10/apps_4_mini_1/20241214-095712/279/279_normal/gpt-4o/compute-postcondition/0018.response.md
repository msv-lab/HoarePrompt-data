To simulate the execution:
1. The variable `x` is updated with the value of `p[x] - 1`. The current value of `x` is `p[0] - 1` before the execution of the code.
2. The state of `visited[x]` is set to True.

Variables that aren't directly updated remain in their initial state. The output state will reflect the updated values of `x` and `visited[x]` while retaining other initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `visited[0]` is True; `cycle` is [0, p[0] - 1]; `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1; visited[x] is now True.**
