The variable `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The values of `n`, `visited`, `cycle`, and `cycles` remain unchanged, while `x` is now equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `visited` remains unchanged; `cycle` is an empty list; `x` is 2; `cycles` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `visited` remains unchanged; `cycle` is an empty list; `x` is 2; `cycles` remains unchanged.**
