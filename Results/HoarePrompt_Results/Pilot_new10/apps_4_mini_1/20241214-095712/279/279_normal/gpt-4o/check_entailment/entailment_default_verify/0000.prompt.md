You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
    no_reverse_components = sum((all((b[x] == 0 for x in cycle)) for cycle in cycles))
    if len(cycles) == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the provided problem description, we need to analyze the code carefully and consider various edge cases as per the problem's requirements.

The main goal is to count the minimum number of changes needed in the permutation `p` and the sequence `b` such that every skewer can visit all `2n` positions.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Cycle Detection**: The program identifies cycles in the permutation `p`. It does this using a visited array to track which indices have been accounted for.

2. **Count Non-Reversing Cycles**: It counts how many cycles contain all zeros in the `b` sequence. These cycles will need at least one change to allow for reversal.

3. **Decide Output**:
   - If there is only one cycle, the output is `0`, suggesting no changes are needed.
   - If there are multiple cycles and at least one of them needs to be changed (i.e., it contains all zeros), it outputs the number of such cycles.
   - If all cycles contain at least one `1`, it defaults to returning `1`.

The key issue arises here: the output logic did not accommodate correctly for when changes are needed. Specifically, while checking for single cycles and multi-cycles, it doesn't handle cases where certain cycles may be forced to be changed because of their structure and contents.

### Potential Inputs Where Program Could Fail:
- Consider the input:
    ```
    4
    1 2 3 4
    0 0 0 0
    ```
  
In this case, there are 4 cycles each being itself but none has a `b` value of `1`. The program will count `4` cycles, which should output `4` changes needed since every skewer must be able to reverse at least once. However, the current implementation defaults to returning `1` when all cycles have `0`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fulfill the requirement of correctly calculating the minimum number of changes needed when all reversing bits are `0`, especially in cases where each index independently needs to be addressed.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones with a length equal to `n`. It identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and evaluates how many of these cycles are purely composed of indices where the corresponding value in `b` is `0`. If there is only one cycle, it prints `0`. If there are multiple cycles, it prints the count of those cycles with only `0` values in `b`, unless this count is less than or equal to `0`, in which case it prints `1`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
