The code `visited[x] = True` sets the element at index `x` of the `visited` list to `True`. The initial state specifies that `x` is 0, so the first element of `visited` will be updated to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `visited[0]` is True; `cycle` is an empty list `[]`; `x` is 0**
