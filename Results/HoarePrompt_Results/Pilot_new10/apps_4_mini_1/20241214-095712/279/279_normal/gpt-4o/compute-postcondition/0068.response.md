Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values indicating whether each index has been visited, `cycles` is a list representing all cycles found in the permutation `p`, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of unvisited cycles. If there is only one cycle in `cycles`, the value `0` has been printed. If there are multiple cycles, `no_reverse_components` is printed if it is greater than 0, otherwise, `1` is printed.***
