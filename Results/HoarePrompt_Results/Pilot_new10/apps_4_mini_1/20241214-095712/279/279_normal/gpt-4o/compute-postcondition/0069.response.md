The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \).
- `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, where the length of `b` is equal to `n`.

The function performs checks or transformations based on these inputs and produces an output. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, since no distinct cases or return values are given for the output, I will summarize the functionâ€™s parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a list p representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list b consisting of zeros and ones (with length equal to n).**
