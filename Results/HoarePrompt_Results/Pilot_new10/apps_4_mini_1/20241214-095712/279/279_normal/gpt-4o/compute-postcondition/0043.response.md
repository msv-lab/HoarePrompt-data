Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `visited` remains unchanged; `cycle` remains unchanged; `x` remains unchanged; `cycles` remains unchanged. If `visited[i]` is False, `i` is 1, `visited` is a list where indices corresponding to values added to `cycle` are True, `cycle` is a list containing values traversed from 1 until a repeated visit occurs, `x` equals the last value assigned from `p[x] - 1` leading to the repeated index in `visited`, and `cycles` has increased in length by 1 to include the current `cycle`. Otherwise, the state of all variables remains unchanged.***
