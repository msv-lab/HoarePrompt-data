Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values indicating whether each index has been visited; `cycles` is a list containing multiple cycles found in the permutation represented by `p`; `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles where all elements in each cycle have not been visited (all `b[x] == 0`).***
