The function accepts a positive integer `n`, along with a list `p` that is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of zeros and ones with the same length as `p`. It counts the number of indices `i` where either `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` (indicating that the permutation is not in its original order) or `b[i]` is equal to 0. The final count is printed as the output. The function does not return a value; it only prints the result. It is important to note that the input is taken from standard input and the function does not handle invalid input cases such as malformed input or ensuring that `b` contains only zeros and ones.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`, counts the elements where the permutation deviates from its original order or where elements in `b` are zeros, and prints this count as the output. **
