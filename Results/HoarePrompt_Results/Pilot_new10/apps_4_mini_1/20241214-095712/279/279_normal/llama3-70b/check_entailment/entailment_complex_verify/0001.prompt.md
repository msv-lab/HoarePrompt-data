You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and identify any potential cases where it may fail to meet the requirements. The goal is to ensure that every skewer visits each of the 2n placements given a permutation p and a sequence b.

### Analyzing the Program
The program uses a loop to check two conditions for each skewer:
1. If the actual position `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, it increments the change count (`ans`).
2. If the value at `b[i]` is `0`, it increments the change count (`ans`).

### Issues in the Logic
1. **General Case Analysis**: The conditions in the loop do not account for the necessity of certain skewer placements that must be visited for the cooking logic. Simply changing `p[i]` when it does not equal `i + 1` and counting changes in `b[i]` does not ensure that each skewer will effectively visit all required placements in both directions. The problem specifically states that it should allow for `k >= 2n`, which means the program must ensure the cyclic nature of visiting all placements, which is not correctly implemented in the logic of changes counted.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a minimal case where n = 1:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     1
     0
     
     Expected Output: 1 (we need to change b[1] to 1 to allow visiting in both directions)

     Program Output: 2 (it incorrectly counts changes and does not recognize the need of one change correctly).
     ```
   - For any `n` skewers where `b` has all zeros, the method does not properly account for the possibility of this needing minimal changes.

3. **Permutation Validation**: The current implementation does not ensure valid permutation checks beyond the direct index look-up – it merely checks if a position matches index. A valid permutation (meaning each number from `1` to `n` is used exactly once) should remain intact within the method of counting changes.

### Conclusion
Given the flaws identified above, the program will not correctly compute the minimum number of changes needed in all cases evaluated against the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), p is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and b is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with the same length as p.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `ans` is equal to the count of indices where either `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` or `b[i]` is equal to 0.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`, counts the elements where the permutation deviates from its original order or where elements in `b` are zeros, and prints this count as the output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
