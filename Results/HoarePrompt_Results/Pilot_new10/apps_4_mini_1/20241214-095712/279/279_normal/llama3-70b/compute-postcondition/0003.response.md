The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer inputted from the user; `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer inputted from the user; `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input; `ans` is 0.**
