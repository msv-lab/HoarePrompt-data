According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index which must be less than `n`. If we want the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, allowing `i` to become `n` for the next iteration, which will stop the loop. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `ans` is set to 2, `i` is equal to n - 1**
