The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial states of `n`, `p`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so we express the updated state in terms of `ans`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `i` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
