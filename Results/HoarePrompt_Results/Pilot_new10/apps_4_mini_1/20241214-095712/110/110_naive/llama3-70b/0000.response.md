To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the program logic.

**Problem Analysis:**
- We are given a pond of size `n x m` and a scoop-net of size `r x r`.
- We need to place `k` fishes in the pond to maximize the expected number of fishes caught when the scoop-net is thrown randomly. 
- The number of potential positions for the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.
- The expected number of fishes caught should be maximized, where the maximum number of fishes that can be caught is limited by either the number of fishes `k` or the number of potential scoop-net positions: `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`.
- The output should be the expected value calculated as the number of fishes deployed divided by the number of potential positions.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
```

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads four integers: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.

2. **Calculation:**
   - It correctly computes the maximum number of fishes that can be caught `ans` using `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`, ensuring that the fish count does not exceed available positions.
   - The expected value is calculated as `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the expected value.

**Potential Problems:**
- The calculation of the denominator `((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` can potentially be zero if either `n - r + 1` <= 0 or `m - r + 1` <= 0, which could happen if `r` is equal to or greater than `n` or `m`. In such cases, the program would attempt to perform division by zero, which will raise an exception.
  
Example of such a case:
- Input: `3 3 4 1`
- Here, `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 4`, which leads to `((3 - 4 + 1) * (3 - 4 + 1)) = (0 * 0) = 0`. This would cause a division by zero.

This logic discrepancy means the program does not handle all possible input cases as required.

Correctness: **False**.
