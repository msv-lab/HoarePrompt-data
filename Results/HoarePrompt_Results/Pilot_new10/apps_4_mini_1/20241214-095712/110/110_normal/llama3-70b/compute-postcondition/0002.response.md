The variable `ans` is printed, which is calculated as the minimum of `k` and `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The computation involves dividing `ans` by the product `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The output of the division will depend on the values of `ans` and the product of `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`.

We have:
- `ans` is the minimum of `k` and `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.
- The division `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` will yield either `1` (if `ans` equals `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`) or some value less than `1`.

Since there is no mention of any variable changing as a result of the print statement itself, the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged in their definitions. The output of this operation is not stored in any variable but is merely output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the minimum of `k` and (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1), and the output is ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)).**
