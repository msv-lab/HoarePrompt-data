The line `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest coverage value tuple from the `heap` and unpacks it into `cov`, `x`, and `y`. The previous values of the affected variables would have been:

- `cov` is the coverage value of the popped tuple.
- `x` is the x value of the popped tuple.
- `y` is the y value of the popped tuple.

After executing this line, `cov`, `x`, and `y` will now hold the values from the tuple that was removed from `heap`, and the values in the initial state for other variables remain unchanged.

The output state must reflect these changes and provide the current values of `cov`, `x`, and `y`. Since `cov` is now equal to the coverage value of the popped tuple, and `x` and `y` have been assigned the respective values from the tuple, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m - 1` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, `total_coverage` is equal to `-2 * cov`, `k` is 1, `cov` is the coverage value of the popped tuple, `x` is the x value of the popped tuple, `y` is the y value of the popped tuple.**
