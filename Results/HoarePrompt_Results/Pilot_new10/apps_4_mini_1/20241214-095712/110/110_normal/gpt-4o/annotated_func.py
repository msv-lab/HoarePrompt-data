#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and r are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m); k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each combination of `x` in range `n` and `y` in range `m`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m - k` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, `total_coverage` is equal to the sum of the coverage values of the `k` tuples that were popped from the heap (which were the tuples with the `k` highest coverage values), `k` is the number of iterations (pops) from the heap that have been executed.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the average coverage per position, calculated as total_coverage divided by total_positions, where total_coverage is the sum of the coverage values of the k tuples that were popped from the heap and total_positions is equal to (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000`, `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 100,000)`. It calculates the total coverage values of the k highest positions from a coverage function over a grid defined by dimensions `n` and `m`. The function then returns the average coverage per valid position, calculated as `total_coverage / total_positions`, where `total_positions` is given by `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The function does not handle scenarios where `total_positions` could be zero (e.g., when `n` or `m` is less than `r`), which could lead to a division by zero error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, and r is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the product of two calculations: the first one is the difference between min(x + 1, n - r + 1) and max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0), and the second one is the difference between min(y + 1, m - r + 1) and max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and computes a product based on their values and the integers `n`, `m`, and `r`. The output is determined by two calculations involving `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` where it evaluates the ranges defined by `r`. It does not explicitly check the inputs beyond their non-negativity and does not account for potential out-of-bound scenarios or errors. The result may yield negative values if the inputs lead to such conditions, which is not captured in the annotations.
