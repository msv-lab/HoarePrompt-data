According to the code, the loop executes `k` times. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again. Since `k` is not specifically mentioned but must be greater than or equal to 1, it implies that there will still be iterations left. 

In its last iteration, the loop will be executed with `k` being decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased to at least 2 because the loop needs `k` to be at least 1 to execute.

The amount of iterations remaining after the last execution is `k - 1`, which defines that `k` was at least 1 before the last execution. 

Thus, if `k` is currently 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be set to at least 2 (as `k` will decrease by 1 with each loop iteration). 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, `total_coverage` is equal to `-cov`, `k` is 2, `cov` is -coverage(x, y), `x` is x, `y` is y, where (cov, x, y) is the tuple with the highest coverage in the heap.**
