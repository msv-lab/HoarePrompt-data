You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle all edge cases and has potential flaws in its logic. Specifically, the implementation of the `coverage` function seems incorrect. The `coverage` function is intended to calculate the number of cells that a scoop of size `r × r` would overlap with if positioned at coordinates `(x, y)`, but the logic used for calculating the boundaries of overlap is flawed.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5 5 5 1
```

With this input, you have a pond of size 5x5, and a scoop of size 5x5, and you're trying to place 1 fish. In this scenario, there is only one position where the scoop can be placed, which covers all 25 cells containing the fish. The expected number of caught fishes should be 1 since you can only place 1 fish, but according to how the code calculates covered positions, the `coverage` function may not return the intended values, especially when the scoop extends beyond the bounds of the pond.

This leads to incorrect outputs for certain inputs where boundary conditions apply, causing the program to not fulfill the requirements as stated in the problem description. Thus, since there is at least one set of inputs where the program does not work correctly, the overall correctness is deemed false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts four integers: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000`, `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 100,000)`. It calculates the total coverage values of the k highest positions from a coverage function over a grid defined by dimensions `n` and `m`. The function then returns the average coverage per valid position, calculated as `total_coverage / total_positions`, where `total_positions` is given by `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The function does not handle scenarios where `total_positions` could be zero (e.g., when `n` or `m` is less than `r`), which could lead to a division by zero error. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and computes a product based on their values and the integers `n`, `m`, and `r`. The output is determined by two calculations involving `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` where it evaluates the ranges defined by `r`. It does not explicitly check the inputs beyond their non-negativity and does not account for potential out-of-bound scenarios or errors. The result may yield negative values if the inputs lead to such conditions, which is not captured in the annotations. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
