The variable `total_coverage` is updated by subtracting the value of `cov` from it. The previous state indicates that `total_coverage` was equal to `-2 * cov`. After the subtraction, the new value of `total_coverage` can be expressed as `-2 * cov - cov`, which simplifies to `-3 * cov`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m - 1` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, `total_coverage` is equal to `-3 * cov`, `k` is 1, `cov` is the coverage value of the popped tuple, `x` is the x value of the popped tuple, `y` is the y value of the popped tuple.**
