n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of one side of the scoop, and k is a positive integer representing the number of distinct fishes to be placed in the pond. Additionally, the constraints are 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 100000).
