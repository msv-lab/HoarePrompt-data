The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a tuple onto the `heap` which contains three elements: the negative value of `coverage(x, y)`, the value of `x`, and the value of `y`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `y` remain unchanged. The outcome depends on the specific values of `x` and the result of `coverage(x, y)`. 

Given that:

- `n` is between 1 and 10^5 (unchanged)
- `m` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `y` is 0 (unchanged)

The value `coverage(x, y)` is a function of `x` and `y`, and `-coverage(x, y)` will result in a value that can be negative or positive based on the implementation of the `coverage` function.

As such, the output state reflects that a new value has been pushed onto the heap, but without knowing the exact result of `coverage(x, y)`, we cannot specify the value of that element. Therefore, the output state indicates that the state of `heap` has been modified.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, and a tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` has been pushed onto the `heap`.**
