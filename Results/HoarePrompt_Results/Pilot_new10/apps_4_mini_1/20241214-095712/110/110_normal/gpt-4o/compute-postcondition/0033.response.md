According to the code, the loop is set to execute `k` times, which is currently 2. After the last iteration, the loop has executed once, so for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increase the count of the completed iterations. Since `k` was 2, after one iteration it needs to be decreased by 1 to execute again.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` should be decreased by 1 to 1, indicating one execution remaining.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `heap`, `total_coverage`, `cov`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` with one tuple removed, `total_coverage` is equal to `-2 * cov`, `k` is 1, `cov` is the coverage value of the popped tuple, `x` is the x value of the popped tuple, `y` is the y value of the popped tuple.**
