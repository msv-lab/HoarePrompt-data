The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. All parameters are integers that fall within specific constraints: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and `k` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5). After executing the function body, it calculates the average coverage per position, returning this value as the result. The average coverage is determined by dividing the total coverage (the sum of coverage values of the k tuples popped from the heap) by the total positions, which is calculated as (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, returning the average coverage per position calculated as total_coverage divided by total_positions.**
