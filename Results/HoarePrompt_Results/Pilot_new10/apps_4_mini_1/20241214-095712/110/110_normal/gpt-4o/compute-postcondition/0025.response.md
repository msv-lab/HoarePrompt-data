The loop iterates over every combination of `x` in the range of `n` and `y` in the range of `m`, pushing a tuple into the `heap` for each combination. This means, after the loop has executed for all iterations, the `heap` will contain all combinations of `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `x` from `0` to `n-1` and all `y` from `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, `heap` will have a total of `n * m` tuples if both `n` and `m` are at least `1`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is between 1 and 10^5, `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each combination of `x` in range `n` and `y` in range `m`.**
