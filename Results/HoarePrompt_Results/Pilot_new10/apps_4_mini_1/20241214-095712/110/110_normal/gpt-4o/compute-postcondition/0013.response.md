The code executes `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))`, which pushes a tuple onto the `heap`. The first element of the tuple is `-coverage(x, y)`, the second element is `x`, and the third element is `y`. 

Since `y` is 1, the heap receives the tuple values `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`, where `coverage(x, 1)` would be some computation based on the values of `x` and `1`. This operation does not modify `n`, `m`, or `y`, but it adds a new element to the `heap`. 

There is no information provided about the structure of `heap`, nor the specifics of `coverage`, so the only modification comes from the addition of the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, a tuple `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)` has been pushed onto the `heap`.**
