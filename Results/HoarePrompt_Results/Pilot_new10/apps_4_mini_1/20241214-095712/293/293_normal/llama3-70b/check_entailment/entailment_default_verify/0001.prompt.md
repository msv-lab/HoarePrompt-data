You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
def func():
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        n //= 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code along with the requirements.

The function attempts to calculate the number of nodes Amr visits before reaching the exit by following the algorithm described.

The main logic in the code operates as follows:
- It reads two integers, `h` and `n`, where `h` is the height of the binary tree and `n` is the index of the exit node among the leaves.
- It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of nodes visited.
- A while loop continues until `n` is greater than 1.
- Inside the loop:
  - If `n` is even, it adds to `ans` the value of `n // 2 - 1`.
  - If `n` is odd, it adds to `ans` the value of `n // 2`.
  - It then divides `n` by 2 to move up to the parent node in the binary tree.

Now let's observe the expected behavior based on what the problem describes, particularly concentrating on how the node visits are counted:

1. The leaf nodes are indexed from 1 to \(2^h\), but the algorithm should track the total number of nodes Amr visits in the binary tree before reaching the leaf node `n`.
2. The calculation should follow the movement through the tree, considering both left (`L`) and right (`R`) commands.

The key concern here arises in the handling of the counts added to `ans`. Essentially:
- The algorithm does not simulate the full traversal of the commands "LRLRLR..." which affects the logic of skipping already visited nodes, reverting actions after two skips, and so on.

### Potential Case for Incorrect Logic:
Let's explore the case where:
- For \( h = 2 \) and \( n = 1 \) (which means this is the leftmost and first leaf).

Per the provided logic, initial evaluations would yield:
- For \( n = 1 \): 
  - Since \( n \) never enters the while loop (it does not meet \( n > 1 \)), `ans` will remain 0.
  
**Expected Output:** 
Amr never leaves the root, resulting in 0 nodes visited before reaching exit (which is node 1 itself).

However, for \( h = 2 \) and \( n = 1 \), we can argue that visiting the root would at least be counted before reaching it regardless of whether it is the exit node or not. Hence, it should be 1.

Thus, there is an inconsistency in the output when Amr starts at the exit leaf:

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly count the nodes visited in all scenarios, particularly when the exit is at node 1. Hence, the output fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `h` and `n` from input, processes them in a loop to calculate a sum `ans` based on the values of `n` as it is halved. Specifically, for every even `n`, it adds `n // 2 - 1` to `ans`, and for odd `n`, it adds `n // 2`. The process continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point the loop exits and `ans` is printed. If `n` begins as 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `ans` at 0. The function does not return any values, only printing the final result. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
