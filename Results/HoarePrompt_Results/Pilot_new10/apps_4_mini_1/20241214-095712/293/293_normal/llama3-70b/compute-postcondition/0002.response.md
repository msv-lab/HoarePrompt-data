To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition for the `while` loop: `n > 1`.

Given that `n` is defined as `input_n` and the constraints are that `input_n` must be between 1 and \(2^{input_h}\) (where \(1 \leq input_h \leq 50\)), we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Currently, it is stated that `n` is `input_n`. Since `n` can take a value of 1 (the minimum value given the constraint), it would not meet the `n > 1` condition and therefore would not execute the loop.

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 1. 

Thus:
- If `input_n` is currently 1 (the minimum value in the range), we must adjust it to be at least 2.
- There is no need to adjust `h` or `ans` since they do not influence the execution condition of the loop.

State: **`h` is input_h, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 0**
