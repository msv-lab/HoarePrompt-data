The values of `h` and `n` are assigned based on the integer input values provided by the user. The specific values for `h` must remain in the range `1 ≤ h ≤ 50`, and for `n`, it must remain in the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`, reflecting the allowed constraints. Since we do not have the specific input values, we denote them as `input_h` and `input_n`.

Output State: **`h` is input_h, `n` is input_n, where 1 ≤ input_h ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ input_n ≤ 2^input_h**
