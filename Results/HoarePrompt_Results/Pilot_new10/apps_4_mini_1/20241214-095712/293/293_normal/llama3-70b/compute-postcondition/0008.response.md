The value of `n` is halved by the operation `n //= 2`. The previous conditions stated that `n` is greater than 1. After this operation, `n` becomes `n // 2`, which will still be greater than or equal to 1, according to the initial condition. Other variables (`h` and `ans`) remain unaffected in value, but their meanings may relate to the new value of `n`.

If `n` was originally even, `ans` would be still defined as `(n // 2) - 1`, but now with `n` halved, it translates to `(n // 2) // 2 - 1`, and if `n` was odd, `ans` was `n // 2`, which means `ans` would still retain its prior computation but needs re-evaluation with the new value of `n`.

However, since we haven't calculated a new specific value for `ans`, we'll leave it in its previously defined state for both even and odd.

Output State: **`h` is equal to input_h, `n` is equal to the previous value of `n // 2`, if the original `n` was even, then `ans` is a positive integer equal to `((n // 2) - 1)`; if `n` was odd, `ans` is equal to `(n // 2)`.**
