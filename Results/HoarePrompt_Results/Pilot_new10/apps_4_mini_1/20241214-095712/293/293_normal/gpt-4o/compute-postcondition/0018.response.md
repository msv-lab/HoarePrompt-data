Postcondition: ***`h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, and `current_level` are integers with 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, and `total_leaves` is 2, while `visited_count` is 3. `path` is a binary string of length `h`. If `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `path[1]`. Otherwise, `current_node` is 2.***
