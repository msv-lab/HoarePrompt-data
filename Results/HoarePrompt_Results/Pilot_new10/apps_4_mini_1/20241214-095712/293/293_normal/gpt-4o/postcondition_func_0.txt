The function reads two integers, `h` and `n`, from the input, where `h` determines the depth of a binary tree and `n` identifies a specific node within that tree. It calculates the path from the root to this node in the binary tree and counts the number of edges traversed (i.e., the levels visited). The function then prints the number of visited edges, which corresponds to the depth `h`, confirming that the function operates correctly for all valid values of `h` and `n` given the stated constraints.
