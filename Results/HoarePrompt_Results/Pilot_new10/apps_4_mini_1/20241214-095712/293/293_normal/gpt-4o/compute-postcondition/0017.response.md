Given the initial state, `current_node` is updated based on the character at index 1 of `path`. Given that `current_node` is initially 0 (as stated by `current_level` being 0) and `path` is a binary string, let's assume `path[1]` is either '0' or '1' to determine how `current_node` will be calculated, but since it requires an update based on the character, we can proceed with the calculation assuming it represents a decision point.

The expression `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` modifies the value of `current_node`. Since `current_node` initially is 0, the calculation becomes:

- `current_node = 2 * 0 + 2 = 2`

So `current_node` is assigned the value of 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string of length `h`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2.**
