Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it only calculates the number of nodes visited from the root to the specified node `n` based on its binary representation without considering the skipping of commands or backtracking that Amr would perform according to the rules.

For example, let's consider input `h = 2` and `n = 3`. Following the provided algorithm, the path Amr would take from the root would involve the following:

1. The player tries to go left (to node 1).
2. The player tries to go right (to node 2). Both nodes would be visited, leading to a count of 2, but Amr needs to continue to (and reach) node 3.
3. When the player finally reaches node 3, according to the game rules, the exit should be reached when correctly navigating the tree.

According to the description and the provided examples, the actual number of nodes visited before reaching the exit should consider more than just the depth of `h` but also the strategy of movement and the backtracking involved. The program does not implement these elements and instead just relies on the binary representation of the leaf node number. 

Thus, the program cannot handle specific cases correctly, particularly when there are skips in commands. Hence the correctness is marked as **False**.
