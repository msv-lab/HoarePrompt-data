Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly scenarios when `n = 1` and various values of `k`. For example, in the case when there is only one row (n = 1), the logic for calculating the maximum and minimum questions asked becomes flawed with the wrong assumptions about cycles. The calculated `max_questions` and `min_questions` are derived incorrectly because they rely on the assumption of multiple rows, and it does not properly account for repeated questions in a single row scenario.

Furthermore, edge cases where `k` is significantly large (close to \(10^{18}\)) can also break the logic, as integer divisions and modulus operations could lead to incorrect cycle counts and therefore incorrect questions distribution.

This can result in incorrect outputs for any input where the conditions mentioned are met, contradicting the problem description requirements. Thus, the code fails to be correct in all scenarios as required.
