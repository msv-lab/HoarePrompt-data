Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` has been decreased by `m`, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1, `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is the total number of increments and decrements during the loop execution, `direction` is equal to 1. If the current values of `row` and `col` are equal to `x` and `y` respectively, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
