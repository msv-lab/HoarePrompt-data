Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers where `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`. `x` is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to `n - 2`. `y` is the previous value decreased by `m`, and `col` is 0. If `direction` is equal to 1 and `row` is equal to `n`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is decreased by 2, and `direction` is set to -1, while other variables maintain their previous values. Otherwise, if `direction` is not equal to 1 and `row` is equal to -1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `row` is updated to `row + 2`, with `sergei_questions` increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `row` is not equal to -1, all values remain unchanged, and `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, and `min_questions` retain their previous values and constraints.***
