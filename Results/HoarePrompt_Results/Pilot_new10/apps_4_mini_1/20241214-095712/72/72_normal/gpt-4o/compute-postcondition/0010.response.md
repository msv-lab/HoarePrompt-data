After evaluating the provided code snippet, we understand the following:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `x` is a positive integer equal to either the previous value if it was greater than 1 or 0.
   - `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`.
   - `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`.
   - `full_cycles` is an integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`.
   - `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`.
   - `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`.
   - `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   The line `max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)` reassigns the value of `max_questions` based on the current values of `full_cycles` and `n`. 
   - The value of `full_cycles` remains constant as `k // full_cycle_length`. 
   - The expression `(2 * n - 2)` remains constant because `n` is unchanged by this line.

3. **Calculation**:
   The new value of `max_questions` will be calculated as:
   - `max_questions` will equal `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.

Thus, the updated value of `max_questions` changes, while all other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State**: 
**`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to either the previous value if it was greater than 1 or 0, `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is an integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.**
