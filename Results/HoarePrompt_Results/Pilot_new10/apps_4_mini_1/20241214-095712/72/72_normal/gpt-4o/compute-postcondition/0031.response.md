Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is updated to `(previous value) + 1`, `row` is now `n - 2`, and `direction` is set to -1 when `row` equals `n`. There is no change in the state if `row` does not equal `n`.***
