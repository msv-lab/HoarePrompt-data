Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is the previous value decreased by `m`, `col` is 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
