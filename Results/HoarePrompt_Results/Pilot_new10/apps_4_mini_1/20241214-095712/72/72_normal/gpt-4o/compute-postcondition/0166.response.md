Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` has been decreased by `m`, `sergei_questions` is the count of occurrences across the `m` iterations where `(row == x and col == y)`, `full_cycle_length` equals `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is the total number of increments and decrements during the loop execution, `row` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the last direction, and `col` equals `m`.**
