The statement `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. The previous value of `row` is `n - 1`, so the new value of `row` becomes `(n - 1) - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.

The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will be updated for `row` while preserving the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` has been decreased by `m`, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1, `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is equal to -1, `row` is equal to `n - 3`, and the previous value of `row` was `n - 1`.**
