Postcondition: ***If `direction` is equal to 1, then `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`; if `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to `x + direction - 2`, `col` remains `y`, `sergei_questions` is updated appropriately based on the condition, and `y` is decreased by `m`. Additionally, `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` has been increased by 1. If `direction` is not equal to 1, then `n` is still an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `k` is greater than `full_cycle_length`; if `row` is equal to -1 after executing the if statement, then `row` is updated to `x + direction + 2`, `col` remains `y`, `sergei_questions` is updated appropriately based on the condition, and `y` is decreased by `m`. The `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1. The value of `direction` is set appropriately based on the condition.***
