Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is an integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, `sergei_questions` is equal to `min_questions`.***
