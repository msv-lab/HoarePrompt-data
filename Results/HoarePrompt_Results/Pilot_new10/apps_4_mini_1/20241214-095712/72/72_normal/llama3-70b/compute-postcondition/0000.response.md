The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned based on the input provided by the user through `map(int, input().split())`, which takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts those strings to integers, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` respectively. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the integer values from user input.**
