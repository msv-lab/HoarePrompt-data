In the initial state, the variable `total_distance` is calculated as the sum of elements in the array `speeds`. The code provided is a print statement that outputs the value of `total_distance`. Other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, and `speeds`) retain their previous values since the code does not modify them.

Since the output from the print statement does not change the state of any variables and only displays `total_distance`, we report that back in the output state. 

Output State: **`v_1` is a user-defined integer, `v_2` is a user-defined integer, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds` is an array based on the formulae provided, `total_distance` has been printed.**
