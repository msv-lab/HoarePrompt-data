The value of `speeds[0]` is assigned the value of `v_1`, which is an integer defined by user input. The previous values of `speeds` contain `t` zeroes, and now the first element will be changed to `v_1`. Other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers defined by user input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100; `d` is an integer between 0 and 10; `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is equal to `v_1` and the remaining elements are zeroes.**
