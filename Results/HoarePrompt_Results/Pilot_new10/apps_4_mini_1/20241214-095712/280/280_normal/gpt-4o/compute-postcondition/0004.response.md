The last element of the list `speeds` at index `-1` is assigned the value of `v_2`. The values of `v_1` and `v_2` are determined by user input, while `t` remains within the range of 2 to 100, and `d` is between 0 and 10. The first element of the list `speeds` is `v_1`, and all other elements are zeroes prior to this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `speeds[-1]` while retaining the other variables' conditions.

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers defined by user input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100; `d` is an integer between 0 and 10; `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is equal to `v_1` and `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v_2`, and the remaining elements are zeroes.**
