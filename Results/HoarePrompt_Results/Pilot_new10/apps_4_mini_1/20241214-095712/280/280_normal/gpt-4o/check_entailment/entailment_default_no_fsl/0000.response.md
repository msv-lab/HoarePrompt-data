Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not account for the scenario when trying to maximize the path length given the constraints of speed change (`d`). Specifically, while filling in the intermediate speeds, the program sets the speed at the `i`-th second as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`. This incorrectly limits the maximum adjustments that can be made to the speed.

Consider a test case:
```
Input:
5 6
4 2
```
Expected output: `26`

However, the program may not reach that maximum path length because the way it fills `speeds` can lead to premature limitation on how much speed can increase or decrease before reaching `v2`. 

For example, in this test case, although the speeds are correctly initialized, the logic in setting the middle speeds restricts the values too early, rather than allowing for gradual rise to the maximum possible speed before descending to `v2`. 

Thus, there are potential inputs where the program will not work as expected, confirming that it fails for certain valid input cases while aiming for a maximum distance.
