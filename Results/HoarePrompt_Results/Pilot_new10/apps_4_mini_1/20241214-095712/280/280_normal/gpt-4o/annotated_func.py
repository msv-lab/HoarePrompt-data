#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100; t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - If `t >= 2`: `v_1` is user-defined integer, `v_2` is user-defined integer, `t` is the user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`, continuing in the same manner up to `speeds[t-1]`, which would be computed based on the logic of the loop.
    #- If `t < 2`: `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, remaining elements of `speeds` are zeroes.
    #
    #Given this detailed analysis, the concise output state accounting for all iterations completed within the specified bounds is:
    #Output State:
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters but reads input integers v1, v2, t, and d, calculating a speed list based on these values. It initializes the first speed as v1 and the last as v2, filling in intermediate speeds constrained by the values of v2 and d. Finally, it computes and prints the sum of the speeds. The function's behavior is entirely reliant on user input and does not handle erroneous or out-of-bound inputs, thus, if invalid data is provided, it may lead to unexpected results or errors.
