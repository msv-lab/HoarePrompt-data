According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The `for` loop is structured to iterate from `1` to `t-1`, meaning `t` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute at least once. The loop variable `i` will start from `1` on the first iteration. 

At the point just before entering the loop, `speeds` is defined with `speeds[0]` equal to `v_1` and `speeds[-1]` equal to `v_2`, while all other elements in between are zero. This state doesn't pose any issue for the execution of the loop.

To ensure the loop can execute, the states need to be set as follows: `t` should remain within its defined boundaries (which is already ensured as per the initial state provided), and `i` should be initialized at `1` for the first iteration. 

State: **`v_1` is an integer defined by user input, `v_2` is an integer defined by user input, `t` is 2 or more, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and remaining elements are zeroes, `i` is 1**
