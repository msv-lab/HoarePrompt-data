To begin, we analyze the given variables and their values based on the initial state. 

- `v_1` is an integer defined by user input.
- `v_2` is also an integer defined by user input.
- `t` is a value of 2 or more, which means t can be 2 or larger.
- `d` is an integer between 0 and 10.
- `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` equals `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` equals `v_2`, and the remaining elements of the list are initialized to 0.
- `i` is equal to 1.

Next, we analyze the line of code to determine its effect on the program:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

1. **Calculate `speeds[i - 1] + d`:**
   - Here `speeds[i - 1]` corresponds to `speeds[0]`, which is `v_1`.
   - So, `speeds[i - 1] + d` becomes `v_1 + d`.

2. **Calculate `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`:**
   - Substituting `i` with 1 gives `(t - 1 - 1)` or `(t - 2)`.
   - Thus, `(t - 1 - 1) * d` is effectively `(t - 2) * d`.
   - Therefore, `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d` results in `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`.

3. **Use min function:**
   - As a result, `speeds[1]` will be assigned the minimum of `v_1 + d` and `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`.

Next, we update the values in the output state:

- The variable `speeds[1]` is updated to the calculated value `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
- Other variables retain their previous values, as no other changes are made.

Therefore, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`v_1` is user-defined integer, `v_2` is user-defined integer, `t` is 2 or more, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, remaining elements of `speeds` are zeroes, `i` is 1**
