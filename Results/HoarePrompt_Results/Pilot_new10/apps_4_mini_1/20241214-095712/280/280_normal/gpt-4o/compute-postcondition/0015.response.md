Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters but reads input integers v1, v2, t, and d, calculating a speed list based on these values. It initializes the first speed as v1 and the last as v2, filling in intermediate speeds constrained by the values of v2 and d. Finally, it computes and prints the sum of the speeds. The function's behavior is entirely reliant on user input and does not handle erroneous or out-of-bound inputs, thus, if invalid data is provided, it may lead to unexpected results or errors. **
