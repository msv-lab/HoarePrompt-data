To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the current values of the variables involved in the operation.

1. The variable `speeds[i]` is assigned the value `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.
2. The current state of the variables is:
   - `speeds[0]` = `v_1`
   - `speeds[1]` = `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`
   - `speeds[-1]` = `v_2`
   - `i` = 2

3. Let's calculate the value of `speeds[i]`:
   - `speeds[i - 1] = speeds[1] = min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`
   - The expression `(t - i - 1)` evaluates to `(t - 2)` because `i` is 2.
   - Thus, `(t - i - 1) * d` becomes `(t - 2) * d`.

Combining these together:
- `speeds[i] = min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`

This formula for `speeds[i]` updates the value of `speeds[2]`. The states of the other variables will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`v_1` is user-defined integer, `v_2` is user-defined integer, `t` is 2 or more, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, remaining elements of `speeds` are zeroes, `i` is 2.**
