To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state:

`min_speed` is assigned the value of `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`. This means that `min_speed` is increased by `d`, and then compared with `max_speed`. The new value of `min_speed` will be the lesser of the two.

The variables that would need to be updated are `min_speed`, while other variables remain unchanged. We can state `min_speed` based on the calculation involving `d` and `max_speed`.

Since `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`, and `max_speed` is either `max_speed - d` or `min_speed`, we note the following conditional behavior:
- If `max_speed - d` is greater than `min_speed`, the new `min_speed` will take the increased value; otherwise, `max_speed` will limit it.

Given these considerations, we do not know specific values, but we know the relationships and ranges.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is either `max_speed - d` or `min_speed`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`.**
