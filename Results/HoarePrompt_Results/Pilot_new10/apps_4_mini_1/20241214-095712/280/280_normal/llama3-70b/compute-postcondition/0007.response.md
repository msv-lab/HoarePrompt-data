Let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the provided code.

Initial State: 
- `v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `t` is 2 or greater
- `d` is an integer between 0 and 10
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`
- `max_length` is `max_speed * t`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t`
- `i` is `t - 1`

The code snippet:
```
max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `max_speed` has an initial value, which is the greater of `v_1` and `v_2`.
2. The value of `max_speed - d` calculates a new potential maximum speed. This value is reduced by `d`, which can vary from 0 to 10.
3. The `min_speed` remains unchanged as it is derived directly from the initial values of `v_1` and `v_2`.
4. The `max` function will return the greater value between `(max_speed - d)` and `min_speed`.

Now, the potential new value for `max_speed` must be evaluated carefully:
- If `max_speed - d` exceeds `min_speed`, `max_speed` will be updated to that value.
- If `max_speed - d` is less than or equal to `min_speed`, `max_speed` will be assigned the value of `min_speed`.

Output State: 
- `v_1` is between 1 and 100
- `v_2` is between 1 and 100
- `t` is 2 or greater
- `d` is between 0 and 10
- `max_speed` is now either `max_speed - d` or `min_speed` (if `max_speed - d` <= `min_speed`)
- `min_speed` (still the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`) remains unchanged
- `max_length` (calculated before) may now not reflect the current `max_speed` value
- `min_length` remains unchanged
- `i` remains unchanged

Therefore, the specific values for `max_speed` will reflect the result of this operation, leaving other variable states intact.

Final Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is either `max_speed - d` or `min_speed` (if `max_speed - d` <= `min_speed`), `min_speed` is `min` of `v_1` and `v_2`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`.**
