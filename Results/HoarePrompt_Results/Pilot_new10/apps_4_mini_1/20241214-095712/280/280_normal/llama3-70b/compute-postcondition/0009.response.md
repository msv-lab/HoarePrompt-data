The variable `max_length` is updated by adding `max_speed` to it. Specifically, if `max_length` had an initial value of `max_speed * t`, the new value of `max_length` will be `max_speed * t + max_speed`, which simplifies to `max_speed * (t + 1)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is either `max_speed - d` or `min_speed`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_speed * (t + 1)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, and `i` is `t - 1`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is either `max_speed - d` or `min_speed`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_speed * (t + 1)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`**.
