You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the code:

The goal of the program is to calculate the maximum possible length of a path section given:
- Initial speed `v1`
- Final speed `v2`
- Time `t`
- Maximum allowed change in speed `d` between consecutive seconds

The program does the following:
1. It reads the initial speeds and the parameters `t` and `d`.
2. It initializes `max_speed` and `min_speed` to the maximum and minimum of `v1` and `v2`, respectively.
3. It calculates an initial `max_length` based on the higher speed over the entire time `t`.
4. It updates the speeds in a loop from `t-1` down to `1`, adjusting according to `d`:
   - Decreases `max_speed` by `d`, but not below `min_speed`.
   - Increases `min_speed` by `d`, but not above `max_speed`.
5. It accumulates the `max_length` by adding `max_speed` at each second.

However, there is an issue with how the speeds are adjusted within the loop. The way it accounts for the adjustments does not guarantee the maximum path calculation for various potential speed transitions due to how `max_speed` and `min_speed` are handled after their initialization.

### Problem Found:
1. A potential edge case arises when `v1 = 1`, `v2 = 100`, `t = 2`, and `d = 99`. In this case, the expected maximum length should be:
   - At second 1: Speed could go from `1` to `100` (by `99`), then at second 2: Speed remains `100`.
   - Yet the current implementation will constrain the speeds such that after one iteration, `max_speed` becomes `1` (due to the logic of max/min updates), leading to inaccurate path length calculations.

### Testing the Edge Case:
For the input:
```
1 100
2 99
```
The expected calculation would provide:
- Path: `1` + `100` = `101` (1s with speed 1 and 1s with speed 100)
However, the program wrongly constrains speed calculations.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for this edge case as noted and potentially others. Therefore, it does not consistently compute the maximum path length according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100), t is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), and d is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10).
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        
        max_length += max_speed
        
        min_length += min_speed
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer value between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is equal to `max_speed - (t - 1) * d` or `min_speed`, `min_speed` is equal to `min_speed + (t - 1) * d`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, and if `t` is 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `max_speed` and `min_speed` unchanged, and `max_length` and `min_length` equal to `max_speed * t` and `min_speed * t` respectively.
    print(max_length)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
