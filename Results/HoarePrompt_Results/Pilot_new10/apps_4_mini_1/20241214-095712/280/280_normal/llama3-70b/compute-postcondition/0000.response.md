The values of `v_1` and `v_2` are updated based on the input from the user. These values are now specific integers within the range provided (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100). The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`v_1` is updated to an integer input value between 1 and 100, `v_2` is updated to an integer input value between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10)**
