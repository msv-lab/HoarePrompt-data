Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than 3, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `i` is `t - 3`, `max_speed` is still `max_speed`.**
