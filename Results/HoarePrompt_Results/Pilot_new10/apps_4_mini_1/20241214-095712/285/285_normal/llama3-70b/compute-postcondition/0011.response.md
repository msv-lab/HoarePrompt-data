The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variable values are changed, and the program does not proceed any further. Therefore, any statement regarding the output state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is `(n - 123456) // 1234` and 'YES' has been printed, and the program has exited.**
