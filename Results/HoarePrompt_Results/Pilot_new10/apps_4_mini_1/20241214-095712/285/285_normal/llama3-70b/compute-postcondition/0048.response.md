Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is at least 1, `b` is `prev_b + 1`, and `c` is calculated as (n - a * 1234567 - (prev_b + 1) * 123456) // 1234. If the equation a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program execution has been terminated.***
