The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately and prevents any further execution of code. As a result, no variables are changed, and all values remain consistent with their initial state prior to the exit call.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567; `b` is the next integer greater than `b_current`, which is less than or equal to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`; `c` is equal to `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`; 'YES' has been printed.**
