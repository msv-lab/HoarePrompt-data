According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The loop continues while `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. 

To determine the updated states:
1. Calculate the maximum value of `b` allowed: `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`.
2. Since `a` is currently 0, we can simplify this to `n // 123456`. 
3. The loop variable `b` will increment by 1 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be less than or equal to `(n - 0 * 1234567) // 123456`, which is essentially `n // 123456`. If `b` is currently 0, then for the loop to continue, after incrementing, `b` should become 1. Thus, the state adjustments are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `n // 1234`; `n - a * 1234567` must be greater than or equal to 123456 for the loop to execute again.**
