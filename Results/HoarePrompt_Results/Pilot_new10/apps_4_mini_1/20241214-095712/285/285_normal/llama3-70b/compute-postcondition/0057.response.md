The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It relies on the condition that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9. Since the output has not been specified, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` must be inferred based solely on the provided parameter constraints. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the internal logic related to a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. The specific return value of the function is not provided.**
