The given code snippet only prints 'YES' and does not change any variable states. Therefore, the values of the variables will remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567; `a` is at least 1; `b` is `prev_b + 2`; `c` is calculated as (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234; value 'YES' has been printed.**
