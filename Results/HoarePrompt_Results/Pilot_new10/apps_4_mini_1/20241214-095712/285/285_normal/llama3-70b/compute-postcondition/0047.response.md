The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the execution of the program. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program simply stops running. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the existing conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is at least 1, `b` is `prev_b + 1`, `c` is calculated as (n - a * 1234567 - (prev_b + 1) * 123456) // 1234, and 'YES' has been printed; the program execution has been terminated.**
