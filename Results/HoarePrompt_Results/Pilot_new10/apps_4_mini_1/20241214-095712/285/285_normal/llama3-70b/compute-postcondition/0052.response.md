The code snippet executes an `exit()` function, which terminates the execution of the program. As a result, no variables are updated or changed. The state of the program remains unchanged in terms of variable assignments or calculations.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567; `a` is at least 1; `b` is `prev_b + 2`; `c` is calculated as (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234; value 'YES' has been printed; no variables have been changed or returned.**
