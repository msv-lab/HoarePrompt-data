The `exit()` function is called, which stops the execution of the program immediately. Since no variables are modified by this operation, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that the program execution has been halted, and all initial conditions still hold.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `246912`, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, and `c` is a non-negative integer starting from `0`; program execution has been halted.**
