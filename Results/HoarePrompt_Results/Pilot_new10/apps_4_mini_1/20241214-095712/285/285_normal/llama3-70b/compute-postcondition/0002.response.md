To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop statement:

```
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
```

1. Start with the value of `n`, which is given as a positive integer.
2. The variable `a` starts at 0.
3. The expression `n - a * 1234567` simplifies to `n` because `a * 1234567` is 0 when `a` is 0. 
4. Hence, the expression for `b` simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{range}((n - 0) // 123456 + 1) \Rightarrow \text{range}(n // 123456 + 1)
   \]
5. For the range to execute, its argument must be greater than 0:
   - \(n // 123456 + 1 > 0\)
   - This implies that \( n // 123456 \geq 0\), which is guaranteed since \( n \) is a positive integer.
   
Thus, the current states do not change the initial conditions to execute the loop because \( a \) is already set to 0, and \( n \) is a positive integer.

Now we need to clarify the initial states for `b` when the loop starts:
- Since `b` starts at 0, it will take values from 0 up to \(( n // 123456)\).
  
Therefore, the adjusted state can be recorded as:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 0**
