Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than `car_cost`, `b` is at least `1`, and `remaining_after_cars` is less than `remaining_after_houses`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions related to costs and remaining balances have been fulfilled.***
