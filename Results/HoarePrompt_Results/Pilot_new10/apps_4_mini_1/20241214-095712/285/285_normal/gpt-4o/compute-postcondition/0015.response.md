The variable `b` is defined as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. Since `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than `car_cost`, we conclude `b` is at least `1`. Therefore, the expression `b * car_cost` will result in a value that is at least `car_cost`. 

Now, `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Since `b` is at least `1`, the value of `b * car_cost` will reduce `remaining_after_houses` by at least `car_cost`. This means that `remaining_after_cars` will be less than `remaining_after_houses`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than `car_cost`, `b` is at least `1`, and `remaining_after_cars` is less than `remaining_after_houses`.**
