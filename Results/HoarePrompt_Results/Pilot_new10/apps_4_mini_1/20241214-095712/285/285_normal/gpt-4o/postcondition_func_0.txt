The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and checks if it's possible to buy a combination of houses, cars, and computers within the budget of `n`. Specifically, it attempts to find integers `a` and `b` such that the leftover funds after buying `a` houses and `b` cars is divisible by the cost of a computer. If such a combination exists, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. If `n` is less than the cost of a house, it will return 'NO' since it does not even allow for purchasing a house.
