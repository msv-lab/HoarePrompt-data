You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code and evaluate if it meets all requirements.

The problem states that we need to find non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:

\[ a \times 1,234,567 + b \times 123,456 + c \times 1,234 = n \]

The program implements this with two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over possible values of \(a\) (the number of houses), while the inner loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) (the number of cars). For each combination of \(a\) and \(b\), it checks if the remaining game-coins can be spent entirely on computers (checking \(c\)).

Here are a few edge cases to consider:

1. **Minimum Edge Case**: If \(n = 1\), the output should be "NO" since it's impossible to buy any of the items.
2. **Exact Cost Cases**: 
   - If \(n = 1234\), it should return "YES" since we can buy 1 computer for 1234 game-coins.
   - If \(n = 123456\), it should return "YES" since we can buy 1 car for 123456 game-coins.
   - If \(n = 1234567\), it should return "YES" since we can buy 1 house for 1234567 game-coins.
3. **Larger Combinations**: We can also test larger sums like \(n = 1234567 + 123456 + 1234\) which equals \(1359257\) to ensure it correctly identifies combinations of multiple items.

The nested loop structure of the code appears adequate to test potential combinations. However, it relies solely on the feasibility of \(n\) fully reducing to multiples of the defined costs, which may lead to missed combinations due to the ordering of houses followed by cars.

### Review of Logic:

However, in cases where integers are involved, particularly with larger values, the use of nested loops could potentially be inefficient or miss lower combinations especially given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The upper bounds of \(a\) and \(b\) are limited to the given integer division by the house and car costs, but this approach may not always encompass all possible values of \(c\).

### Potential Case of Failing:

Consider \(n = 999998\):
- The functions never attempts to go directly for combinations that might need just some computers, leaving out cases with unique combinations possible. The highest sums of houses and cars do not fully explore cases based on smaller increments that may interact with \(c\) particularly.

In addition, it does not cover cases comprehensively by ensuring all potential contributions of \(c\) given remaining coins after houses and cars have been considered correctly without missing values for \(c\).

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The implemented logic does not universally apply to all potential sums of \(n\), failing specific combinations where exact calculations may not reach \(n\) just with houses and cars alone.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and checks if it's possible to buy a combination of houses, cars, and computers within the budget of `n`. Specifically, it attempts to find integers `a` and `b` such that the leftover funds after buying `a` houses and `b` cars is divisible by the cost of a computer. If such a combination exists, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. If `n` is less than the cost of a house, it will return 'NO' since it does not even allow for purchasing a house. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
