The variable `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses` minus the product of `b` and `car_cost`. Given that `b` is 0, the calculation simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is at least `1234567`, `b` is 0, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
