The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, there are several cases for the return value:

- Case_1: The program returns 'YES'.
- Case_2: The program returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions set by the initial state are satisfied.
- Case_3: The program returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions related to costs and remaining balances have been fulfilled.
- Case_4: The program returns 'YES'.
- Case_5: The program returns 'YES'.
- Case_6: The program returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions are met for the provided values of n and remaining_after_houses.
- Case_7: The program returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for purchasing items have been successfully met.
- Case_8: The program returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for purchasing the car and remaining funds for a computer are satisfied, as remaining_after_cars is not evenly divisible by computer_cost.
- Case_9: The program returns 'YES' indicating that all conditions related to n, remaining_after_houses, and car_cost allow for this outcome.
- Case_10: The program returns 'NO', indicating that the combinations of `remaining_after_cars` do not yield a value divisible by `computer_cost`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return various results based on specific conditions being met, with possible return values of 'YES' under different positive conditions and 'NO' when certain conditions regarding the remaining balance and costs are not satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and it returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on various condition checks, with multiple scenarios that can lead to a 'YES' return.**
