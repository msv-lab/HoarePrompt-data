To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to examine the loop condition.

1. The loop runs with `a` taking values from `0` to `n // house_cost`, inclusively. 
2. For the loop to execute at least once, the expression `n // house_cost` must be greater than or equal to `0`. 
3. Since `n` is at least `1` and `house_cost` is `1234567`, `n // house_cost` will result in `0` when `n` is less than `house_cost` and it will only be greater than `0` when `n` is at least `house_cost` (which is `1234567`).

Given that `house_cost` is `1234567`, for the loop to execute:
- If `n` is less than `1234567`, the loop will not execute (as `n // house_cost` would be `0`).
- If `n` is exactly `1234567`, the loop executes once (for `a = 0`).
- If `n` exceeds `1234567`, the loop will execute multiple times.

Thus, the requirement for the loop to execute is that `n` must be at least `1234567`, and it can be any integer from `1234567` to `10^9`.

Since `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, the specific adjustment needed is for `n` to be at least `1234567` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` must be at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0**
