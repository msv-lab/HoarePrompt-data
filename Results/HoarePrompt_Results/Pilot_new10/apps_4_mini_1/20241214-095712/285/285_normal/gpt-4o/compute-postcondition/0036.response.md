In the code snippet provided, `remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value of `n - a * house_cost`. Here, `a` is the result of the expression `n // house_cost + 1`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is at least `1234567`
- `remaining_after_houses` is at least `123456`
- `b` is at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`
- `a` is `n // house_cost + 1`

The calculation of `remaining_after_houses` updates its value based on the values of `n` and `a`. 

1. Calculate the value of `a`:
   - `a` = `n // house_cost + 1`

2. Update `remaining_after_houses`:
   - `remaining_after_houses` = `n - (n // house_cost + 1) * house_cost`
   - This implies that the new value of `remaining_after_houses` is `n - n // house_cost * house_cost - house_cost`.

The specifics of `house_cost` are not given, but we can ensure that `remaining_after_houses` is still valid based on the constraints listed above.

Output State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - (n // house_cost + 1) * house_cost`, `b` is at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.**
