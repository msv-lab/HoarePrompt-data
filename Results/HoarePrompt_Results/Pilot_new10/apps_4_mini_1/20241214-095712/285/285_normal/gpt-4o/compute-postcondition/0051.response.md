Output State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost` where `a` is at most `n // house_cost`, `b` is at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, and if the inner loop executed, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` where `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is `0`, meaning the function returned 'YES'. If no combination of `remaining_after_cars` made it divisible by `computer_cost`, the function will not return 'YES'. If the loops do not execute at all, then `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n`.**
