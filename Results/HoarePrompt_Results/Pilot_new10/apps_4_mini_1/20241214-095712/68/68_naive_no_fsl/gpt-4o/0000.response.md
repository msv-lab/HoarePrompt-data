Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the voting results based on the input values of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z) according to the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes:
   - `min_upvotes = x`
   - `max_upvotes = x + z`
   
2. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible downvotes:
   - `min_downvotes = y`
   - `max_downvotes = y + z`

3. The program then checks:
   - If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it correctly concludes that downvotes are guaranteed to be greater, so it outputs `'-'`.
   - If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it correctly concludes that upvotes are guaranteed to be greater, so it outputs `'+'`.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, it indicates uncertainty and outputs `'?'` because there are scenarios possible where upvotes could equal downvotes or vice versa.

The program handles all edge cases correctly and adheres strictly to the problem description. I am unable to identify any input where the program would yield an incorrect result, so the correctness value is assessed to be true.
