To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze how the program responds to different inputs. 

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to evaluate the voting outcome based on three inputs: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). The outcomes can be:
- "+" if upvotes are definitively more than downvotes.
- "-" if downvotes are definitively more than upvotes.
- "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes.
- "?" if the outcome is uncertain based on possible configurations of the unknown votes.

### Evaluating the Provided Code
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```

#### Analyzing Edge Cases:
1. **Case:** `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`  
   - Expected Output: "-"  
   - The program correctly reports `-`.

2. **Case:** `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`  
   - Expected Output: "+"  
   - The program correctly reports `+`.

3. **Case:** `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`  
   - Expected Output: "0"  
   - The program correctly reports `0`.

4. **Case:** `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`  
   - Expected Output: "?"  
   - The program correctly reports `?`.

5. **Additional Case:** `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`  
   - When `z` votes as an upvote: `x + 1 > y` → "+"  
   - When `z` votes as a downvote: `x < y + 1` → "-"  
   - Expected Output: "?"  
   - The program is expected to output "?", and it does so.

6. **Case:** `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 1`  
   - When `z` votes as an upvote: `x + 1 > y` → "+"  
   - When `z` votes as a downvote: `x < y + 1` → "-"  
   - Expected Output: "?"  
   - The program should handle this as uncertain correctly.

### Conclusion
After testing various cases, including boundary and typical scenarios, we find that the program properly handles all potential cases as described in the problem. It correctly identifies scenarios where the results are definite and scenarios where they are uncertain.

Thus, we conclude:
Correctness: **True**
