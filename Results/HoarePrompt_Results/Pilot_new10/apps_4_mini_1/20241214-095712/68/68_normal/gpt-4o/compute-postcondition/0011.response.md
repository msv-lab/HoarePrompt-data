The code simply prints a question mark (`?`) but does not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the values of existing variables in the program remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, `max_upvotes` is equal to or greater than `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.**
