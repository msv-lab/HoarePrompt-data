To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step and compare it against the given conditions.

The problem describes a situation where:
- `x` represents the number of definite upvotes.
- `y` represents the number of definite downvotes.
- `z` represents the number of unknown voters whose votes can either be upvotes or downvotes.

The output should reflect:
1. "+" if upvotes definitely exceed downvotes.
2. "-" if downvotes definitely exceed upvotes.
3. "0" if upvotes equal downvotes.
4. "?" if the outcome is uncertain due to the presence of unknown votes.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The program reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input.

2. **Calculating Minimum and Maximum Votes:**
   - It calculates:
     - `min_upvotes = x` (The minimum number of upvotes is all known upvotes)
     - `max_upvotes = x + z` (The maximum would be if all unknowns are upvotes)
     - `min_downvotes = y` (Minimum downvotes are known downvotes)
     - `max_downvotes = y + z` (Maximum if all unknowns are downvotes)
   
3. **Decision Making:**
   - It checks the conditions:
     - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, print `'-'` (definite downvote advantage).
     - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, print `'+'` (definite upvote advantage).
     - Otherwise, print `'?'` (uncertainty due to overlapping possibilities).

### Output Hints Evaluation:
The output hints suggest that the function correctly assesses the number of votes based on the minimum and maximum calculations. They confirm the logic used to determine the result:

- If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, it prints `'-'`.
- If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints `'+'`.
- If neither condition holds, it indicates uncertainty with `'?'`.

### Test Cases:
Let's verify some edge cases against the program's logic:

1. **Case: (0, 0, 1)**
   - Minimum Upvotes: 0, Maximum Upvotes: 1
   - Minimum Downvotes: 0, Maximum Downvotes: 1
   - The output is `'?'`, which is correct since the outcome can vary depending on the unknown vote.

2. **Case: (2, 0, 1)**
   - Minimum Upvotes: 2, Maximum Upvotes: 3
   - Minimum Downvotes: 0, Maximum Downvotes: 1
   - The output is `'+'`, which is correct since there are at least 2 upvotes regardless of the unknown.

3. **Case: (1, 1, 0)**
   - Minimum Upvotes: 1, Maximum Upvotes: 1
   - Minimum Downvotes: 1, Maximum Downvotes: 1
   - The output is `'0'`, which accurately indicates that the votes are equal.

4. **Case: (3, 7, 0)**
   - Minimum Upvotes: 3, Maximum Upvotes: 3
   - Minimum Downvotes: 7, Maximum Downvotes: 7
   - The output is `'-'`, confirming that downvotes exceed upvotes.

### Conclusion:
The program adequately checks each potential case as per the description and the outputs align with expectations.

Final assessment:

Correctness: **True**.
