The function accepts three integers x, y, and z (with values ranging from 0 to 100) as input arguments. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. It then evaluates these calculated values and prints '-' if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, '+' if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, or '?' if neither condition is met, indicating that overlaps exist between the possible upvotes and downvotes.
