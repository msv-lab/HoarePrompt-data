Postcondition: ***`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, if `max_upvotes` (which equals `min_upvotes + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which equals `y`), then '-' has been printed. Otherwise, `max_downvotes` (equal to `y + z`) is evaluated; if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then '-' has been printed again, but if not, either '+' is printed or `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.***
