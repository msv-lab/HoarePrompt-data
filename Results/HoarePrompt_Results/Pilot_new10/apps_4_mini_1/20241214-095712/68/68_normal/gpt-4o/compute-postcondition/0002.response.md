The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value `x + z`. The variable `x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, and both `y` and `z` are integers in the range from 0 to 100. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will be greater than or equal to `min_upvotes` (since `z` can be 0) and up to `min_upvotes + 100` (as `z` can be at most 100). The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`.**
