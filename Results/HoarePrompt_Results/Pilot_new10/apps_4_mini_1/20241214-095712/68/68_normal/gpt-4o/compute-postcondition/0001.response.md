`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, which is one of the input integers from the range 0 to 100. The variables `y` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` takes the value of `min_upvotes`, while `y` and `z` retain their initial integer values.

Output State: **`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100**
