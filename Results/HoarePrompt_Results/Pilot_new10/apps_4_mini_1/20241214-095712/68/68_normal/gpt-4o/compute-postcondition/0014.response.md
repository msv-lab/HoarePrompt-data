The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each of these parameters is an integer constrained by the requirement that they lie within the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive). The function's output is not defined in the provided data, so I cannot state the specific return value or behavior related to the parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, each within the range of 0 to 100.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, and z which are integers constrained between 0 and 100 (inclusive).**
