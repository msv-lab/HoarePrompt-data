Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's how it adheres to the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) using the `input()` function and splits them into individual variables, which is consistent with the expected input format.

2. **Calculating Minimum and Maximum Votes**:
   - It correctly calculates:
     - `min_upvotes` as \(x\) (the guaranteed upvotes)
     - `max_upvotes` as \(x + z\) (the maximum upvotes, accounting for all unknown voters potentially voting up)
     - `min_downvotes` as \(y\) (the guaranteed downvotes)
     - `max_downvotes` as \(y + z\) (the maximum downvotes, accounting for all unknown voters potentially voting down)

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - The program evaluates the conditions correctly:
     - It checks if all possible upvotes (maximum) are less than the minimum downvotes, in which case it concludes the result is definitely downvotes ("-").
     - It checks if all possible downvotes (maximum) are less than the minimum upvotes, in which case it concludes the result is definitely upvotes ("+").
     - If neither condition is satisfied, it concludes that the outcome is uncertain, leading to output "?".

This structured approach ensures that the output reflects the only possible outcomes based on the input values, and it accounts for all specified edge cases, fulfilling the problem description's requirements comprehensively. Each part of the program aligns with the described scenario, ensuring correctness.
