The provided program accurately follows the logic outlined in the problem description and meets the requirements as defined. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the user input for `x`, `y`, and `z` and checks the conditions to determine the result, returning '-' for downvotes being greater, '+' for upvotes being greater, or '?' for uncertainty as intended.

The program handles the different scenarios outlined in the examples correctly:
- It distinguishes the scenarios where there is a clear outcome (either more upvotes or more downvotes).
- It appropriately addresses the uncertainty when there is potential overlap in the possible results.

The output hint provided also clarifies the conditions checked by the program and affirms that it effectively covers the required output conditions specified in the problem description.

Since both the original assessment and the output hints corroborate the correctness of the program, the final assessment of the program's correctness stands confirmed.

Final: **True**
