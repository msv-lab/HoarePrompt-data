Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` (each between 0 and 100) as input and performs the following checks: If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'; if `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'; if `x` is equal to `y`, it further checks if `z` is 0, printing '0' for that case; if `z` is not 0, it prints '?'. For cases where `x` is not greater than `y + z`, not less than `y`, and not equal to `y`, it defaults to printing '?' regardless of the values of `y` and `z`. The function does not have a return statement, so it does not return any value, only prints outputs based on the conditions evaluated.**
