The `print('?')` statement simply outputs the character `?`, and does not modify any variables or state. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and `z` is greater than 0.**
