The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input provided and will directly reflect the integers input by the user. The ranges for `x`, `y`, and `z` (0 to 100) remain valid but the specific values will depend on the user's input. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100**
