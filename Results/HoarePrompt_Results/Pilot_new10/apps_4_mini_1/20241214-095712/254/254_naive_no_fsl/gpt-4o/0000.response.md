Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals (k1, k2, k3) is 1 to determine if at least one garland can be lit at every second. However, the problem description specifies that there should be at least one garland lit during every second after the maximum of the three chosen switching times. 

This means that the program fails to consider or produce a configuration of x1, x2, and x3 that ensures all seconds are covered by one of the garlands being lit. For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
4 4 4
```

Here, the GCD is 4, which would lead the program to output 'NO', suggesting that it is impossible to light the garlands continuously. However, if Mishka turns on all three garlands at any time (for instance, at the same time), the garlands will actually light up at 4-second intervals thereafter, meaning there are seconds when no garland would be lit after any second greater than 4. The output should be 'NO', but the logic to derive that from the problem has not been accurately implemented in the code.

Thus the condition of having one garland lit every second is not satisfied in all potential scenarios since garlands may have periodic intervals that leave gaps. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description correctly.
