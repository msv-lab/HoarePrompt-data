The provided program attempts to determine if it is possible for Mishka to switch on three garlands, represented by their respective time intervals, such that at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum starting time. The program does this by calculating the GCD of the three garland time intervals (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`). If this GCD equals 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible for Mishka to light the garlands in a way that fulfills the requirement; if the GCD is greater than 1, it prints 'NO'.

However, the logic of the program is flawed. The requirement states that there should be at least one lit garland during every second after the maximum switching time, which is not correctly captured by simply checking if the GCD of the intervals is 1. Specifically, there may be cases where the intervals are not pairwise coprime, yet it is still possible to light the garlands in a way that covers all seconds.

For example:
- Consider the intervals `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 4`, `k3 = 6`. The GCD of these numbers is 2, hence according to the program, it would print 'NO'. However, if Mishka sets `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 1`, and `x3 = 1`, the garlands would light at seconds `1, 3, 5, ...` (for k1), `1, 5, 9, ...` (for k2), and `1, 7, 13, ...` (for k3), covering all seconds after 1. Therefore, there is no correct logic being applied here that guarantees an accurate coverage of all seconds.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly determine the conditions under which Mishka can successfully light the garlands as required.

Correctness: **False**.
