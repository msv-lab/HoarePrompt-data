The code prints 'YES'. The values of the variables do not change as a result of the print statement; it only affects the output. Therefore, the Output State remains the same, with no change in the integer values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `gcd_k1_k2`, or `gcd_all`.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, `k3` are integers with values as input from the user; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`; `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, and the current value of `gcd_all` is 1, indicating that `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are pairwise coprime.**
