Postcondition: ***`k1`, `k2`, `k3` are integers with values as input from the user; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`; `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. The current value of `gcd_all` is 1, indicating that `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are pairwise coprime.***
