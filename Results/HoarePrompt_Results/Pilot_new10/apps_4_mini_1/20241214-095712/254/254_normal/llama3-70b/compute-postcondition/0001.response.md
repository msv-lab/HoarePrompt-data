The values of `a` and `b` will be updated in the following way: 

- The value of `b` is assigned to `a`, and the new value of `b` becomes the result of `a % b`. Since `b` must be greater than 0, the modulus operation will yield a valid integer value for `a % b`. Given that `a` is an integer, the output will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b`.

Since we don't have the initial values for `a` and `b`, we can't provide specific numeric outcomes, but we can define their relationships. 

After executing the code, the output state incorporates this relationship while retaining the precondition that `b` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the value of `a % previous_b`, where `previous_b` is the original value of `b` and `b` must be greater than 0.**
