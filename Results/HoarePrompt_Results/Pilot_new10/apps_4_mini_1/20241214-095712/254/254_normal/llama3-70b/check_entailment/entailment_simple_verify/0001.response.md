The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program's logic. The program attempts to check if every second at or after the maximum switching time has at least one garland lit by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals and checking if this LCM is divisible by each interval. However, simply confirming LCM divisibility does not ensure that all times will have a garland lit. 

As exemplified in the counter-example given with `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`, when the moments chosen for turning on the garlands lead to certain seconds where no garland is lit, that clearly contradicts the requirement of the problem statement.

The provided annotated version reinforces this conclusion. It explains the correct calculation of the LCM and the finding of the GCD via the `func_1` function, but ultimately shows that these calculations do not verify the requirement of at least one garland being lit at every second after the maximum start time. 

Given all this information, the original assessment remains valid and accurate.

Final: **False**
