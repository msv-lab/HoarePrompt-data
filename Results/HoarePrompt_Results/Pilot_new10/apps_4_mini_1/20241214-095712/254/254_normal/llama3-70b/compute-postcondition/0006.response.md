Output State: **`a` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0. If the original value of `b` was greater than 0, the loop executed and `a` is the last non-zero value of `b` before it became zero. If the original value of `b` was 0, the loop did not execute, and `a` remains unchanged.**
