To analyze the code, we see that it involves a tuple unpacking, where the values of `a` and `b` are reassigned simultaneously. Specifically, `a` takes on the current value of `b`, and `b` takes on the result of `a % b`. 

From the initial state, `a` is currently equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is guaranteed to be non-zero. Since `a` must be greater than or equal to `previous_b`, we can assume `a` is at least as large as `b` in certain scenarios depending on their values. 

The output for `b` after the reassignment will be `previous_b % b`, which is guaranteed to be a valid operation because `b` is non-zero. The new value of `a` is simply the previous value of `b`.

Now, let's analyze the values:

- Previous value of `a`: is `previous_b`.
- Previous value of `b`: is non-zero (let's denote it as `b`).
- New value of `a`: is now equal to the previous value of `b`.
- New value of `b`: is `previous_b % b`.

The output state summarizes the states of `a` and `b`:

Output State: **`a` is equal to the previous value of `b`; `b` is equal to `previous_b % b`, where `b` is non-zero, and `a` is greater than or equal to `previous_b.**
