To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem description and understand its requirements.

Mishka aims to ensure that at least one of the three garlands is lit at each second after switching them on. This boils down to choosing three integers \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \) for the three garlands such that the combined lit times of the garlands overlap in a way that there are no gaps where all garlands are off.

The program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the time intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \). It prints "YES" if the GCD is 1 and "NO" otherwise.

### Analysis of the Program:
- If the GCD of the time intervals is 1, it means that there is a way to choose \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \) such that the lit times of the garlands can cover all seconds without any gaps.
- If the GCD is greater than 1, then there exist intervals in which the garlands cannot overlap perfectly, leading to some seconds where none are lit.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Example Input**: \( 1, 1, 1 \)
   - GCD is 1 -> Output should be "YES". The program correctly identifies that at least one garland is lit.
   
2. **Example Input**: \( 2, 4, 6 \)
   - GCD is 2 -> Output should be "NO". The program results in "NO", which is correct as every second will have gaps.

3. **Example Input**: \( 3, 5, 7 \)
   - GCD is 1 -> Output should be "YES". The program would print "YES", indicating proper coverage.

4. **Example Input**: \( 6, 8, 10 \)
   - GCD is 2 -> Output should be "NO". The program's output here matches the expectation.

### Conclusion:
Every example provided in the problem description and the additional scenarios validated demonstrate that this approach is correct. Since there are values that can create overlap based on parameter choice, and it correctly identifies when coverage is not possible, there are no flaws detected.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning and verification with test cases:
Correctness: **True**.
