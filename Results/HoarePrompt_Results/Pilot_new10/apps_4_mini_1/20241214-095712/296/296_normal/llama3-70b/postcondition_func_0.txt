The function prompts the user for an integer input `n`. If `n` is equal to 2, it prints 'NO'. For any value of `n` greater than 2 (up to 10^9), it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and then prints '1' along with the integer division of `n` by 2, and finally '1' followed by `n`. The function does not return any value.
