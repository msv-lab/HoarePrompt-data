Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the requirements of the problem description. It only checks for the case where \( n = 2 \) and directly outputs 'NO', which is correct. However, for values of \( n > 2 \), the program incorrectly assumes that the fractions \( \frac{1}{n // 2} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \) will always yield a sum equal to \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). 

A critical mistake is that it does not verify whether \( n // 2 \) meets the criteria of \( 1 < b_i < n \) and does not consider that \( b_i \) must divide \( n \). For example, when \( n = 4 \), the output of the program would be 'YES', providing fractions \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \). The correct answer should actually be 'NO', as there is no suitable set of fractions that add up to \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} \).

Additionally, it doesn't handle the edge cases for larger values of \( n \) and gives a static response of 2 fractions without considering other possible divisors of \( n \).

Because there are numerous cases where the output is incorrect, the conclusion is that the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.
