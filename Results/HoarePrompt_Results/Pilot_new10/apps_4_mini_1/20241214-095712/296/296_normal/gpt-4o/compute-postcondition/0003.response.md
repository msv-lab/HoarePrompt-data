The variable `divisors` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged because there is no operation performed on `n`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `divisors` is now an empty list, while `n` retains its original value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is an empty list**.
