The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the `divisors` list. The initial conditions indicate that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is defined as `i_last + 2`, and `int(math.sqrt(n))` is also greater than or equal to `i_last + 2`. The operation does not change the values of `n`, `i_last`, or the expression involving `math.sqrt(n)`, but it does affect the contents of the `divisors` list by adding the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3`; `i` is `i_last + 2`; `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= i_last + 2; divisors` now includes the value of `i`.**
