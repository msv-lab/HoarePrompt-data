According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is a positive integer with `n >= 3`, and `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Since `i` starts at 2, if it hasn't yet reached `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, the loop will execute again. 

If `i` was at its last value (let's denote it as `i_last`), the next value of `i`, which would be `i_last + 1`, needs to be checked against `int(math.sqrt(n))`. Thus for the loop to execute again, `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is greater than `i_last + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3`, `i` is `i_last + 1`, and `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= i`.**
