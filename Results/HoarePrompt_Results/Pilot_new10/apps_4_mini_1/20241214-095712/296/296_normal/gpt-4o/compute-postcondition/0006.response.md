The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state, `divisors` is an empty list, and `i` is 2. After the execution, the value of `divisors` will now contain the integer 2.

The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n` >= 3, `divisors` is now a list containing the value [2], `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` >= 3, `divisors` is now [2], `i` is 2**
