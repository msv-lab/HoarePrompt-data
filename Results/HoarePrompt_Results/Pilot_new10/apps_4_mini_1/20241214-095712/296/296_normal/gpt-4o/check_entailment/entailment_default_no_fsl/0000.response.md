Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is a prime number. According to the problem description, the output should alert when a sequence of fractions is impossible, which includes situations where `n` is prime and thus has no valid divisors `b_i` that satisfy the given constraints (1 < b_i < n). The program returns 'NO' for prime numbers, but it does not ensure that the output condition (specifically, the fractions summing to `1 - 1/n`) can actually be satisfied.

For example, when `n = 3`, which is a prime number, the program will output 'NO', but it fails to account for the fact that the sequence of fractions resulting in `1 - 1/3` cannot be formed since there are no valid denominators that satisfy the conditions for the fractions. In this case, the program skips potentially valid outputs by not evaluating the prime property adequately related to the possibility of forming the required sum with the correct fractions.

Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement for every potential case, rendering it incorrect.
