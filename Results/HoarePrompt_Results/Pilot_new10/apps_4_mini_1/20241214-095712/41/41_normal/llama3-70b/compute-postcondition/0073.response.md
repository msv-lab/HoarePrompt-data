Output State: **`unrated` is False if there exists at least one pair of indices (i, j) such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`, `j` is less than or equal to `n-1`, and `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` instances of input integers. If no such pairs are found, then `unrated` remains True.**
