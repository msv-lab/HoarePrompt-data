Postcondition: ***`unrated` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2. If the value of `ratings_before[1]` is less than `ratings_before[2]`, and the value of `ratings_after[1]` is greater than `ratings_after[2]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
