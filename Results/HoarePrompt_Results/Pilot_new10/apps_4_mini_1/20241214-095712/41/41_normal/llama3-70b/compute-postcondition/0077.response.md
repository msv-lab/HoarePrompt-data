The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is False, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `rated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`unrated` is False, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `rated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
