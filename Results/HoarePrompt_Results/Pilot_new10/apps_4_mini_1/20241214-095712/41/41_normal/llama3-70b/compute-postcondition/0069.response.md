Output State: **`unrated` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` has exceeded `n`, if `ratings_before[1]` is less than any of `ratings_before[j]` for `j` in range `i + 1` to `n`, and `ratings_after[1]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]` for those same indices, then the program has broken out of the loop; otherwise, if no such pair exists, `unrated` remains False, and the loop has completed without conditions being met.**
