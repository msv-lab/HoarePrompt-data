The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, the value of `ratings_before[1]` is less than `ratings_before[2]`, and the value of `ratings_after[1]` is greater than `ratings_after[2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
