To determine the next state at the beginning of the for loop, we need to analyze the values of `i`, `j`, and `n` in relation to the for loop's range and the condition that must still be satisfied for the loop to execute again.

1. We know that the `for j in range(i + 1, n)` indicates that the loop is iterating over `j` starting from `i + 1`, which in this case means starting from `2` since `i` is `1`. 

2. The ending condition for the loop is dictated by `n`, which is greater than or equal to `3`. This means if `n` is `3`, the last value for `j` would be `2`, which allows for only one iteration (`j = 2`). If `n` is greater than `3`, additional iterations will occur.

3. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is currently `3`. We need to prepare the conditions for the next loop execution.
 
4. Given that `j` is currently `3`, for the loop to execute again, we would increment `j` to `4` in the next iteration, which would require `n` to be at least `4` (since the loop would only go up to `n - 1`).

Based on this reasoning, we can summarize the required changes to the state:

- `unrated` must remain `False`.
- `i` remains `1`.
- `j` is incremented to `4`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `4` to enable another iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`unrated` is False, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
