In this case, the call to `ratings_after.append(b)` affects the `ratings_after` list by adding the element `b` to it. The variable `ratings_before` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` remains between 2 and 1000. Therefore, the output state must reflect the updated `ratings_after` while preserving the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` contains two instances of `a`; `ratings_after` contains `b` and the previous elements.**
