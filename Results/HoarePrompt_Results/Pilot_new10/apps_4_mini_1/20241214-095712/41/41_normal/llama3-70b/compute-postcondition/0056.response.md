According to the code, the execution of the loop relies on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute for `j` ranging from `i + 1` (which is 2 in this case, since `i` is 1) up to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 (since it needs to be greater than `i + 1` which equals 2). 

At the start of the loop, `j` will first be incremented to 2 (which is `i + 1`). 

So, the final adjusted state should ensure:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `j` starts at the value of 2.

State: **`unrated` is False, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2**
