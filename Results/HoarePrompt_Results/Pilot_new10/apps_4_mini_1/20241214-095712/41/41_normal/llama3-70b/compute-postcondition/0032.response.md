Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `unrated` is False. If the rating at index `i` is less than the rating at index `j` in `ratings_before`, and the rating at index `i` is greater than the rating at index `j` in `ratings_after`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part to consider.***
