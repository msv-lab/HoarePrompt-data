The statement `unrated = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `unrated`. However, `unrated` is already `False` in the initial state, so there is no change to its value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `unrated` is False**
