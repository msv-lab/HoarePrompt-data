The function `func` does not take any parameters directly as inputs in the function signature. Instead, it operates on an input that consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers `(a_i, b_i)`. Here, `n` is an integer within the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and each pair `(a_i, b_i)` contains integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126, representing the ratings of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The function processes this input and generates output based on these ratings. 

While the specific output has not been defined in the prompt, the function's behavior will depend on the processed pairs of ratings. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of inputs consisting of an integer n followed by n pairs of integers representing participant ratings before and after a round, and processes them to generate an output based on these ratings.**
