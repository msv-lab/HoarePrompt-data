The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop indicated by the presence of the `break` statement. Therefore, even though `unrated` remains False, the relevant conditions indicate the program has concluded the loop successfully. The values are still valid, so we note we have exited the most internal loop. 

Output State: **`unrated` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` has exceeded `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
