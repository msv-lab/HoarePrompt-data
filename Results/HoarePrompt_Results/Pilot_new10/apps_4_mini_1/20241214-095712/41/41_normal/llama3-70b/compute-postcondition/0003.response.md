To determine the states needed for the loop to execute, we must focus on the `n` variable and its role in the `for` loop. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are initially empty lists, we can analyze the situation. 

1. The `for` loop will execute `n` times. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 2 and 1000, the loop can execute at least once.
2. For each iteration of the loop, the underscore `_` is used as a placeholder, indicating that we do not need to track a specific loop variable in this context.

Since both `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are empty lists and there are no constraints based on their current state mentioned for the loop to operate, we mainly confirm that the loop will indeed execute. Therefore, we can outline the adjustments needed:

- `n` is assured to be valid and between 2 and 1000, so no adjustment is necessary there.
- As there are no specific interactions or checks with `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state after considering the above will be:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list**
