Postcondition: ***`unrated` is False, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0. If the values at index `i` in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are not equal, then `rated` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
