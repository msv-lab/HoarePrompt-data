Since `is_unrated` is assigned the value `False`, it directly changes the value of that variable but does not affect any of the other variables, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000; for each participant i (0 <= i < n), a[i] and b[i] are integers representing their ratings before and after the round, satisfying 1 <= a[i], b[i] <= 4126; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is False.**
