The variable `is_rated` is assigned the value `False`. Other variables, including `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ratings`, remain unaffected as there are no changes made to them in the executed code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000; for each participant i (0 <= i < n), a[i] and b[i] are integers representing their ratings before and after the round, satisfying 1 <= a[i], b[i] <= 4126; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False**.
