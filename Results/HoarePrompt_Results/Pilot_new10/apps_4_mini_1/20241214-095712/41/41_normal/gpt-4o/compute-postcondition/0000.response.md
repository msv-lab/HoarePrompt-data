In this code snippet, `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where the value is taken from user input and converted to an integer. The variable `n` could be any integer between 2 and 1000. Other variables, `a[i]` and `b[i]`, are not affected directly by this line of code, and their previous constraints still hold.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, and for each participant i (0 <= i < n), a[i] and b[i] are integers representing their ratings before and after the round, satisfying 1 <= a[i], b[i] <= 4126; `n` is an input integer**
