According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`, which defines the range of the loop. The loop has executed for the current iteration, so the next iteration will occur if the loop can execute once more. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, and the loop completes one iteration with `_` indicating the loop variable is not used, we can deduce the following:

At the end of the last iteration, we have already run one iteration of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the iterator must be incremented, which means that the loop has executed one of its `n` iterations.

So, the next iteration will occur if the loop is less than `n`. Since we have completed one iteration, and to allow for another, `n` still remains the same while the loop index increases by 1 (not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that `_` increments through `range(n)`).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, it will simply be another execution with the quantity of `n` still satisfied.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` and `b` are integers from input; `ratings` contains one tuple `(a, b)`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, `is_rated` is set to True.**
