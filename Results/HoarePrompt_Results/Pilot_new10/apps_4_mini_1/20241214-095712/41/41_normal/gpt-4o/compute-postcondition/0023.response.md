Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of `(a[i], b[i])` for each participant, `is_rated` is False, indicating that all `a[i]` are equal to `b[i]`, `is_unrated` remains False, `i` is 1. The current value of `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`.***
