Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of `(a[i], b[i])` for each participant. If `is_rated` is True, the output is 'rated'. If `is_rated` is False, and `is_unrated` is True, the output is 'unrated'; otherwise, if `is_unrated` is False, the output is 'maybe'.***
