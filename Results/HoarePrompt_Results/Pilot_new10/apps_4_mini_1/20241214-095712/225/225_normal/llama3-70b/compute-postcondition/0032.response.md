The function `func` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters, with the length not exceeding 100 characters. It calculates the maximum jump distance between vowels in the string. A "jump" is defined as the half of the distance between two vowels plus one. If the last vowel in the string is not at the last position, it additionally checks the jump from the last vowel to the end of the string. The function prints the calculated maximum jump. However, there is no explicit return value; the function solely outputs the result via a print statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to compute and print the maximum jump distance between vowels in the string, and take into account the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if necessary. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string of capital English letters, calculates and prints the maximum jump distance between vowels, and considers the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. **
