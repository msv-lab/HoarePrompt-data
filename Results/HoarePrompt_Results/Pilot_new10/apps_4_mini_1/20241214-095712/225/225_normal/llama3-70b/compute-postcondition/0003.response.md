The code initializes `max_jump` to 0, but it does not change the values of any other variables. The value of `max_jump` is now explicitly set. Therefore, the Output State reflecting the updated variable is:

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters with a length between 1 and 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a value between 1 and 100, `max_jump` is 0**
