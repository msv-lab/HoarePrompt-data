Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0, and since the last vowel index is -1, this indicates that there has been no vowel encountered before the current character `s[i]`. The current character `s[i]` is a vowel, meaning `s[i]` is one of 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', or 'Y'.***
