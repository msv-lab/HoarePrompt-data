Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, and `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s` or -1 if none is found. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and half the distance from `last_vowel` to the end of the string plus one.***
