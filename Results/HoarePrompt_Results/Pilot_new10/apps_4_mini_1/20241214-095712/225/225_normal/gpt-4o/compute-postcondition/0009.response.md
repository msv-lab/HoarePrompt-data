The line of code `max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)` assigns the greater value between `max_jump` and `i - prev_pos` back to `max_jump`. 

Given the initial state:
- `max_jump` is 1
- `prev_pos` is 0 (since `s[0]` is a vowel)
- `i` is 1

Now, we compute `i - prev_pos`:
- `i - prev_pos = 1 - 0 = 1`

Next, we compare the values:
- `max(max_jump, i - prev_pos) = max(1, 1) = 1`

Therefore, `max_jump` remains unchanged after the operation.

The other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `prev_pos`, and `i`) remain unchanged as well. Thus, the output state retains all initial variable descriptions while keeping `max_jump` consistent with its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0 when `s[0]` is a vowel, `i` is 1**
