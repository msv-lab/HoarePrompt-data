To determine the output state after the loop has executed, let's analyze the loop carefully, considering the provided initial state and taking into account the required relationships for the variables involved.

1. The variable `max_jump` is initialized to 1 and will be updated based on the positions of vowels found in the string `s`.
2. The variable `prev_pos` starts at -1 and will be updated to the index of the last vowel encountered.
3. The loop iterates through each character in the string `s`, which consists of capital English letters, checking if each character is a vowel.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string, let's summarize the conditions:

- If `s` has at least one vowel, `prev_pos` will be updated to the index of the last vowel found, and `max_jump` will reflect the maximum distance between the current vowel and the last vowel found.
- If there are no vowels in `s`, `prev_pos` will remain -1 and `max_jump` will stay 1, since no updates will take place.

Moreover, by the end of the loop:

- If there are vowels, `prev_pos` will be the index of the last vowel, and `max_jump` will reflect the length of the longest jump found between consecutive vowels (including a jump from the start of the string to the first vowel).

Reflecting these points in the output state, we can formulate the final relationships after all iterations:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum distance between consecutive vowels in `s` (considering the start of the string), `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, which can be -1 if no vowels exist.**
