According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, the length of `s` is at least 1, which means that the loop can execute. At the start of the first iteration, `i` will be initialized to 0, corresponding to the first character of the string `s`. Other variables such as `vowels`, `max_jump`, and `prev_pos` do not affect the execution condition of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `i` should start at 0 corresponding to the first character in `s`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
