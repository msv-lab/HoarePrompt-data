Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters and returns the largest distance ('jump') between consecutive vowels in `s`, including the distance from the beginning of the string to the first vowel and from the last vowel to the end of the string. If `s` contains no vowels, it returns the length of the string, since the `prev_pos` would be -1. **
