Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the string contains no vowels. According to the problem description, if there are no vowels, the Grasshopper should jump the entire length of the string to reach the end. However, in the implementation, if there are no vowels, `prev_pos` remains -1, and as a result, the jump distance calculated would be the entire length of the string. This is incorrect according to the output hints, which state that the function should return the length of the string in such cases.

For example, for the input "BCDFG", the expected output should be `5`, since the Grasshopper has to jump over the entire length of the string, but the program would return 5 because there are no vowels to calculate distances from. 

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when there are no vowels.
