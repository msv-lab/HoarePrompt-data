Correctness: **True**

The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a non-empty string `s` comprised of capital English letters, which conforms to the input specifications of the problem.

2. **Vowel Definition**: The program correctly defines the set of vowels as `'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'`. 

3. **Jump Calculation**: The program effectively calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper. It does this by iterating through the string and maintaining the position of the last found vowel to determine the maximum distance between consecutive vowels, as well as from the start of the string to the first vowel and from the last vowel to the end of the string.

4. **Correct Return Value**: 
    - If there are no vowels found in the string (i.e., when `prev_pos` remains -1), it returns the length of the string `s`, which corresponds to the required jump ability since the Grasshopper would have to jump over the entire string.
    - If vowels are present, the maximum jumps between vowels will be calculated accurately, thus delivering the correct output as specified in the problem description.

5. **All Cases Covered**: The solution considers all possible configurations of the string, including edge cases like strings that consist entirely of vowels, strings that contain no vowels, and strings of varying lengths up to the maximum of 100 characters.

Thus, given these points, the program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description without missing any critical functionality or providing incorrect results for any input it might receive within the specified constraints.
