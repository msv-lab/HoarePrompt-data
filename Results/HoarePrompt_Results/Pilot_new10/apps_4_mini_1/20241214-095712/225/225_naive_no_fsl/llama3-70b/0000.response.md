Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical error that causes it to not meet the problem's requirements in all cases. Specifically, the calculation of the maximum jump ability is incorrect. 

For example, consider the string "AEIOU". In this case, all characters are vowels, so the expected output should be `1` because the Grasshopper can jump directly to any vowel without needing a long jump. The program calculates the jump ability correctly up to the last vowel but improperly computes the distance between vowels and misses edge cases that require jumps to be evaluated differently.

Another problematic example is "ABCD" where the string contains only one vowel 'A'. The Grasshopper starts in front of 'A' and needs to jump directly to 'A', suggesting a jump ability of `1`. However, if there were more gaps between vowels, the program will calculate the jump ability incorrectly as it doesn't account for continuous sections of the string where only consonants are present.

Thus, the program does not reliably compute the minimum jump ability in all scenarios as demanded by the problem and results in the incorrect answer for certain inputs.
