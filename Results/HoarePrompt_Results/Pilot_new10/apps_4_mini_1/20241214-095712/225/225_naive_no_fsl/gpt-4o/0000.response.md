Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the situation where the string contains no vowels. If the input is a string like "BCDFGHJKL", the Grasshopper will never encounter a vowel, and the variable `prev_pos` will remain at its initial value of -1. When the program attempts to calculate the minimum jump ability with the line `max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)`, it will yield `max_jump = max(1, len(s) - (-1))`, which evaluates to `max_jump = len(s) + 1`. 

For instance, for the input "BCDFGHJKL" (which has a length of 10), the program will output 11 instead of indicating that it is not possible to jump because there are no vowels.

Thus, the program fails for the test case:
Input: "BCDFGHJKL"
Expected Output: An indication that no jump is possible (not specified in the original problem description), but would correctly produce a jump ability of `len(s) + 1`. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for all possible inputs.
