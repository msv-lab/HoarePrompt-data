Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the minimum jump ability the Grasshopper should have to reach the end of the string by jumping on vowels. 

Here's how it works:
1. It starts with a jump ability of 1.
2. The `prev_pos` variable tracks the last position of a vowel encountered.
3. For each character in the string, it checks if it is a vowel and updates `max_jump` to be the maximum distance from the previous vowel position to the current position.
4. At the end, it also checks the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
5. Finally, the program returns the maximum calculated jump distance.

All potential test cases, including strings with consecutive vowels, strings with no vowels, or strings made up entirely of vowels, yield the correct minimum jump ability based on the specified logic in the problem description.
