To determine the `stones` variable's value, we will first recognize the initial state, which contains: `n` as a positive integer within the range (1 to 100), `s` as a string of length `n` with only '+' and '-' symbols, and `stones` being defined as `max(0, (number of '+' in s) - (number of '-' in s))`.

Now, when we execute the code `print(stones)`, it's simply outputting the value of `stones` but does not change its value or any other part of the program's state.

Thus, irrespective of the exact value of `stones`, we will maintain the calculation logic in our output.

Output State:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is equal to `max(0, (number of '+' in s) - (number of '-' in s)), and the value of `stones` has been printed.**
