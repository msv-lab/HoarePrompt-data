Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length at least 2, and the operation is the second character of the string `s`. If the operation is '-', `stones` is updated to max(0, stones - 1). If the operation is not '-', the value of `stones` remains unchanged.***
