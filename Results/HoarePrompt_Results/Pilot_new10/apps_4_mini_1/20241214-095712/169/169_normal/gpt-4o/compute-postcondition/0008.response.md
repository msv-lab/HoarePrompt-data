The code updates the value of `stones` to the maximum of 0 and `stones - 1`. Initially, `stones` is 0, so `stones - 1` equals -1. The `max` function will yield 0 because it chooses the maximum between 0 and -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is 0, `operation` is '-', and `stones` remains 0 after executing the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is 0, `operation` is '-'.**
