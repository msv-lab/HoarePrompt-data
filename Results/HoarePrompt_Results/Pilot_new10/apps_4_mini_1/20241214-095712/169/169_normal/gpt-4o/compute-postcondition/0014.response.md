Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n`, and `operation` is a character that exists in the string if it exists. If `operation` is equal to '-', then `stones` is updated to max(0, stones - 1). If `operation` is not '-', the state of `stones` remains unchanged.***
