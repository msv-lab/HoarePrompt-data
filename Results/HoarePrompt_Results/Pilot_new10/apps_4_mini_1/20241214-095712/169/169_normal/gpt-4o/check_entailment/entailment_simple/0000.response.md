To determine the correctness of the given Python program according to the problem description, let's analyze the problem requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing `n` operations, which consist of adding (`+`) or removing (`-`) stones.
2. If a `-` operation is executed, there must be at least one stone available in the pile (meaning the pile cannot go below zero stones).
3. The initial number of stones is not given directly but has to be inferred based on operations.

### Program Analysis:
1. It takes an integer `n` as input (the number of operations).
2. It reads a string `s` of length `n` consisting of `+` and `-` operations.
3. The variable `stones` is initialized to 0.
4. For each operation in `s`:
   - If the operation is `+`, the program increments `stones` by 1.
   - If the operation is `-`, the program tries to decrement `stones` by 1, but ensures that `stones` is not less than 0 using `max(0, stones - 1)`.
5. Finally, the program prints the value of `stones`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program effectively counts how many stones would be in the pile after all operations, ensuring that it never goes below zero. 
- The logic used (`max(0, stones - 1)`) ensures that if there were insufficient stones for a `-` operation, it simply keeps `stones` at 0, thus correctly adhering to the rules stated in the problem.
- The value of `stones` at the end represents the remaining stones after the series of operations and adheres to the concept of starting with some initial number of stones and maintaining the non-negative condition during `-` operations.

### Conclusion:
The program efficiently calculates the minimal possible number of stones left based on the operations performed while ensuring it respects the rules given in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
Correctness: **True**
