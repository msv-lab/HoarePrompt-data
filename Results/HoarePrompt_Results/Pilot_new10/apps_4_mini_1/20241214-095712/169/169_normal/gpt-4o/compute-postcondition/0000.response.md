The value of `n` is assigned from the input after converting it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100. Since the input is dynamic, we cannot determine a specific integer value for `n` but can confirm it will remain within the given range after assignment. The string `s` is unaffected by this code execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length n consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, and `n` is assigned the value from input.**
