The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the provided signature. However, it is mentioned that there are two constraints: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the characters "-" and "+". 

Since the function does not seem to take parameters directly, we can infer that `n` and `s` might be used within the internal logic of the function. 

Assuming the function performs operations based on these constraints, we can outline the possible output. However, the specific operations and the exact return values are not provided. 

Thus, based on common patterns, the functionality could summarize as follows:

Functionality: **The function handles an internal positive integer `n` within the range of 1 to 100 and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+". The specific return values based on these inputs are not defined in the provided information.**
