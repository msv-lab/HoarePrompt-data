To determine the correctness of the provided program for the given problem description, let's analyze the logic behind the program.

The problem states:
- We want to find the minimal possible number of stones in a pile after a series of "+" (adding one stone) and "-" (taking one stone) operations.
- The critical point is that Vasya cannot take a stone from an empty pile, meaning the number of "-" operations cannot exceed the number of "+" operations that occur before it.

The provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)
```

**Logic Analysis:**
1. `minus_count` counts the number of "-" operations, and `plus_count` counts the number of "+" operations.
2. The program checks if `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`. If it is, it prints `0`, assuming that all "-" operations can't be executed if there aren't enough preceding "+" operations. This logically holds because if there are more takes than adds, it's impossible to carry out operations as stated in the problem; hence the pile should not go below zero.
3. If `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`, it simply outputs `plus_count - minus_count`, which calculates the number of stones in the pile as the result.

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input is `2` for n and the string `--`, the program would print `0`, which is correct since having that many takes directly after starting is not valid.
- If the input is `1` for n and the string `+` or `-`, it will also correctly assess the state of the pile.
- However, there's a subtle edge case where if the program does not handle the scenario where we might need negative initialization. For example, upon receiving `n = 5` and `s = "++---"`, the logic here would say we can subtract three when we can only subtract two. The program does not accumulate the required starting stones to ensure all "-" can be translated properly.

**Conclusion:**
Upon considering this reasoning, the program isn't accounting properly for the situation where the minus operations should be limited by the actual sequence of operations, especially when there are fewer additions than required bases for subtractions.

Thus, after analyzing the potential faults:
Correctness: **False**. 

A specific case where the program fails: 
For input `5` and string `--+++`, the function will print `1`, but it should have been initiated with at least `2` stones to compensate for the operations which results in a logical error.
