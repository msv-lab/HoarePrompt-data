The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string `s` retains its previous state of length `n`, but since we don't modify `s` here, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `n` based on user input within the bounds specified (1 <= n <= 500), while `s` continues to be a string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with a value obtained from user input between 1 and 500; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
