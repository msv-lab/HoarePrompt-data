The value of `operations` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `operations` is now 3, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `operations` is 3, `i` is 2**
