The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `operations` was 1, so after the increment, the value of `operations` is now 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` of `s.**
