The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` was 3, so after the operation, `ans` becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 4, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 4, `i` is 2**
