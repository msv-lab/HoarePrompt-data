Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. However, the program simply counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string and prints that count as the answer.

Here's the flaw in the logic:

1. The program initializes `ans` to 1, assuming there is at least one contiguous substring to remove, but this does not account for the fact that multiple distinct contiguous substrings may not directly correlate to the minimum number of operations needed to clear the whole string.

2. The increment of `ans` for every transition between different characters is incorrect in terms of calculating the minimum operations to delete the string. For example, in the string "aabbcc", the program would count three transitions (abc), but the minimum operations to delete the string is actually 3, since each pair can be removed in one operation.

3. The provided example "abcddcba" will return 4 based on transitions, while it can actually be removed in just 4 operations grouped differently. Thus the answer can be misleading.

In summary, the algorithm does not solve the core problem of calculating the minimal number of operations to delete the string according to the problem description. It simply counts character transitions, which does not correspond to the required operations for string deletion. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
