According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` would have some value that is currently less than `n`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1.

Thus, if `i` was less than `n - 1` during the last iteration, it can execute again with `i` being incremented to the next integer. Therefore, at the next iteration, `i` will become `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 2 if the character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` of the string `s`, `i` is `i + 1`**
