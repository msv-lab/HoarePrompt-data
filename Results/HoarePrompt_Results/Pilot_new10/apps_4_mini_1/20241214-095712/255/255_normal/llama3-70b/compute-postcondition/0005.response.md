The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was 1, so after the increment, the new value of `ans` is 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, and the characters at index `i` and index `i - 1` of string `s` are not equal.**
