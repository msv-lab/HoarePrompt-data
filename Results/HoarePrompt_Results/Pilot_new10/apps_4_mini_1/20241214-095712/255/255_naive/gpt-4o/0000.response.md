To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to delete the entire string consisting of lowercase Latin letters by removing contiguous substrings where all letters in that substring are the same. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of such operations needed to delete the string completely.

### Analysis of the Program:
Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)
```

### Functionality of the Program:
1. The program reads an integer n (length of the string) and then the string s.
2. It initializes a counter `operations` to 1.
3. It iterates through the string from the second character to the end.
4. Each time it encounters a character that is different from the previous character, it increases the `operations` counter by 1.
5. Finally, it prints the total count of operations.

### Identifying Potential Issues:
The program essentially counts the transitions (changes) between different characters in the string and assumes that each change represents a necessary operation. However, this approach does not fully grasp the nature of deletions that can happen.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the case where the input string has consecutive blocks of the same character, like `aaaabbbbcccc`. 

- The expected minimum operations to remove the string would be 3:
    1. First, delete "aaaa".
    2. Second, delete "bbbb".
    3. Finally, delete "cccc".
  
- However, with the provided program:
    - The transitions would be counted as follows:
        - From `a` to `b` and from `b` to `c`, leading to an operation count of 3.
    
However, if we had a more complex case, like `aaabbcc`, the expected moves could vary based on contiguous deletions possible, which the program's simple counting fails to consider, leading it to misunderstand how to minimize operations correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program doesn't handle all potential cases correctly. It counts character transitions, concluding an incorrect minimum operation count without considering the ability to delete larger same-character blocks, thus leading to an incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**.
