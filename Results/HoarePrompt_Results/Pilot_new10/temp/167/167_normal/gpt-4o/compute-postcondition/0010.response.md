Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `px` is (a[1] - 1) // y, `py` is (a[1] - 1) % y, `v` is the second element in the list `a`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y. If the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution, unaffected by this condition.***
