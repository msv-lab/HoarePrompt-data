Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). This logic matches the problem description of filtering odd numbers. Since there are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this program to fail, the program is correct.
