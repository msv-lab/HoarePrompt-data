Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out the odd numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and includes it in the result list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as lists with multiple odd and even numbers, lists with only odd or even numbers, and lists with a mix of odd and even numbers. The function works correctly in all these cases, and no edge cases were found where the function fails to meet the requirement of filtering out odd numbers.
