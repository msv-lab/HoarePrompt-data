Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers and returns a list of odd numbers. The function works as expected for the given test cases:

1. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`
2. `assert func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]`
3. `assert func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]`

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This logic correctly filters out even numbers and retains only odd numbers, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function behaves correctly for the provided assertions and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that this function does not handle, we can conclude that the function is correct.
