Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the functionality and correctness of the `func_1` function. The function correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list using a list comprehension. The provided test cases in the annotations cover various scenarios, including lists with multiple odd and even numbers, lists with only odd or even numbers, and lists with a mix of odd and even numbers. The function performs as expected in all these cases, and there are no edge cases identified where the function fails to meet the requirement of filtering out odd numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
