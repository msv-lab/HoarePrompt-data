Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` iterates through the input list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers. The provided test cases in the annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, filtering out even numbers and returning only odd numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
