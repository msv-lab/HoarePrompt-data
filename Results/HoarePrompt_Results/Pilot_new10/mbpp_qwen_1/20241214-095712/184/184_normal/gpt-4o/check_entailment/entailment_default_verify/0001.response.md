Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers and returns a list of odd numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd (`num % 2 != 0`). The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the function, indicating that it accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code, as the function meets the requirements for filtering odd numbers without any issues identified in the output hints.
