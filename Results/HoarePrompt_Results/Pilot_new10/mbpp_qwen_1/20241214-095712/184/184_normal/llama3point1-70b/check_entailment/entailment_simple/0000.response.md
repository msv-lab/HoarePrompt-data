Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. The problem description asks for a function that filters odd numbers. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the returned list only if the number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This precisely meets the requirement of filtering odd numbers from the input list, ensuring the function behaves as specified in all cases.
