Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The list comprehension iterates through each number in `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2, which is the correct logic for filtering odd numbers. The annotations align with the problem description and the code itself, indicating that the program is correct under the given assumptions.
