Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers using the condition `num % 2 != 0`. The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the function, stating that it accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the input list. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases where the input is a valid list of integers, the original assessment is accurate.
