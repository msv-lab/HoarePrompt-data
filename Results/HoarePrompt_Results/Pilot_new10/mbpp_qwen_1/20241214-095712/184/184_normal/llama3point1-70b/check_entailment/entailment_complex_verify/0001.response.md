Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The annotation correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call, and the original assessment is accurate because the function correctly filters out odd numbers based on the provided problem description.
