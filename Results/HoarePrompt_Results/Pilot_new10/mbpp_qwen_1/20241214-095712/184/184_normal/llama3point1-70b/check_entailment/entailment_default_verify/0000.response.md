Final: **True**

Reason: The provided program `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list based on the problem description. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). The output hints also confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the input list. There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this program to fail under the assumption that the input will always be valid. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
