Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. The annotation states that "nums is a list of integers" and that the function returns a list of odd numbers from the original list 'nums'. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of writing a function to filter odd numbers. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
