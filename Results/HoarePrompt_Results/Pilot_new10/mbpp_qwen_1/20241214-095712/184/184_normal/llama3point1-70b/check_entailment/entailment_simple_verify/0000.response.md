Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly indicates that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and returns a list of odd numbers. The list comprehension filters out even numbers by checking if `num % 2 != 0`, which is the correct logic for filtering odd numbers. Given the problem description and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate as the program correctly implements the required functionality without any apparent issues or edge cases that would cause it to fail.
