Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string in all tested cases. However, upon further analysis, the function does not handle cases where the first and last occurrences of the character are the same, nor does it handle cases where the character is not found in the string. For instance:

- Removing the first and last 'x' from 'axbxcx' should result in 'axbxc', but the function returns 'axbxc' which is correct, but the explanation for this case in the original assessment is misleading.
- Removing 'P' from 'PP' should result in an empty string, but the function returns 'PP'. This indicates that the function does not correctly handle the scenario where the first and last occurrences of the character are the same.

The output hints confirm that the function returns the original string if the character is found only once, which aligns with the provided test cases but not with the original explanation that suggests the function should remove the first and last occurrences. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate, and the function is not fully correct based on the problem description.
