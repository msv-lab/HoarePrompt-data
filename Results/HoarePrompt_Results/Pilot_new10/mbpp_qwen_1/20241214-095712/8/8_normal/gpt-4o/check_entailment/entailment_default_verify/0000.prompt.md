You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. Here's why:

- The function uses `s.find(ch)` to get the index of the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(ch)` to get the index of the last occurrence.
- If either the first or last occurrence cannot be found (`-1`), or if both indices are the same (indicating only one occurrence), the function simply returns the original string.
- Otherwise, it constructs a new string by slicing the original string to exclude these indices.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'` (correct).
- `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'` (correct).
- `func_1('PHP', 'P')` returns `'H'` (correct).

Since the function handles edge cases and works as expected for the given examples, it appears to be correct for the described problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found or found only once. Otherwise, it returns a substring of `s` with the characters at the first and last occurrence of `ch` removed. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
