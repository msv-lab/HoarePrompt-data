Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The function handles edge cases such as when the character is not found in the string or when the first and last occurrences are the same. The test cases provided in the problem description are satisfied by the function's implementation, and the annotations align with the behavior described in the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
