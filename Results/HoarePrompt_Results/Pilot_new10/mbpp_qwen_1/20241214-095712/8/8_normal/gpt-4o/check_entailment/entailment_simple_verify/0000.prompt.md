You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. Here's why:

- The function uses `s.find(ch)` to get the index of the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(ch)` to get the index of the last occurrence.
- If either the first or last occurrence cannot be found (`-1`), or if both indices are the same (indicating only one occurrence), the function simply returns the original string.
- Otherwise, it constructs a new string by slicing the original string to exclude these indices.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'` (correct).
- `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'` (correct).
- `func_1('PHP', 'P')` returns `'H'` (correct).

Since the function handles edge cases and works as expected for the given examples, it appears to be correct for the described problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns string 's'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the lowest index where `ch` is found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the highest index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. The condition `first_index != -1 and last_index != -1 and first_index != last_index` is false.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a substring of 's' excluding the characters at 'first_index' and 'last_index'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
