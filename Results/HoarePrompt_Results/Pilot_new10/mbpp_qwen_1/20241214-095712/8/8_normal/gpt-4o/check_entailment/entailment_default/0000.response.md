Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The function handles all potential cases:

1. If the character is not found in the string (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), it returns the original string.
2. If the character is found only once (`first_index == last_index`), it returns the original string as well.
3. If the character is found multiple times, it constructs a new string by removing the characters at the first and last occurrence of the character.

The assertions provided in the code also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
