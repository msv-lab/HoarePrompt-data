`first_index` is assigned the value returned by `s.find(ch)`. The method `s.find(ch)` returns the lowest index in the string `s` where the substring `ch` is found. If `ch` is not found in `s`, it returns -1. The values of `s` and `ch` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the lowest index where `ch` is found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
