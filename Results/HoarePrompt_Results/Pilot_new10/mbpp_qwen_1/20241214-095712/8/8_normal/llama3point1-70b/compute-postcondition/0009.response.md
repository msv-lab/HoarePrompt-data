The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string. 

- In Case_1, the function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by an empty string.
- In Case_2, the function returns a string from `s` with the character `char` removed at both the first occurrence (`first_occurrence`) and last occurrence (`last_occurrence`) indices.
- In Case_3, the function returns the string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `char`, and based on specific conditions, return the string `s` modified according to the presence and removal of the character `char` at certain indices.
