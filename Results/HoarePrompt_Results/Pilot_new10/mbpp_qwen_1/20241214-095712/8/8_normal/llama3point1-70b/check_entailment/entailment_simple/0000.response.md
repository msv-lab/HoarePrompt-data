Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1(s, char)` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the function meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The function first finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` using `s.find(char)`.
   - It then finds the index of the last occurrence of `char` using `s.rfind(char)`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, it means the character is not found in the string, so the function simply returns the original string `s`.

3. **Removing First and Last Occurrence**:
   - If the first and last occurrences of the character are the same (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it indicates there's only one instance of the character in the string. The function then removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, the function constructs a new string by removing the characters at both the first and last occurrences.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - In both cases (whether the occurrences are the same or different), the function returns the modified string as per the requirements.

Given this analysis, the function correctly handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement, making the program correct.
