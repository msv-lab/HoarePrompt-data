Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string as described in the problem. The annotated version clearly shows that the function handles three main scenarios:
1. When the character appears only once, it removes that single occurrence.
2. When the character appears multiple times, it removes both the first and last occurrences.
3. When the character does not appear at all, it returns the original string unchanged.

All these scenarios align with the problem description and the test cases provided, confirming the correctness of the program.
