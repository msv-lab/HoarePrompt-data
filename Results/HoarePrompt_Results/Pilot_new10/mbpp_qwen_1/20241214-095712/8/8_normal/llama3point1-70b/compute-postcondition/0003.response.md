Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`; `last_occurrence` is the highest index of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`. The condition `first_occurrence != -1` and `last_occurrence != -1` is satisfied. The current value of `first_occurrence` is equal to the current value of `last_occurrence`.***
