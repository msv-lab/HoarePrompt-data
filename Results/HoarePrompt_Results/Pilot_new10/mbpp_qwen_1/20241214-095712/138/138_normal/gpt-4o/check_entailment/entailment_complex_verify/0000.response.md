Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The annotated version correctly describes the state of the program and the logic implemented in the function `func_1`. The function iterates through the array, checks for the presence of the element, and returns the appropriate tuple indicating whether the element was found and its index. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
