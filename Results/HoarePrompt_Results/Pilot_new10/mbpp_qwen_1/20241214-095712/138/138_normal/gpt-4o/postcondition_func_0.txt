The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and a single element `element`. It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` and returns `True` along with the index of `element` if found. If `element` is found at positions 0, 1, or 2, it returns `True` and the corresponding index. If `element` is not found in `arr`, it returns `False` and `-1`.
