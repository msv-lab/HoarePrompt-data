Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers or hashable elements) and `element` (an integer or hashable element to search for in the list).

2. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple consisting of a boolean indicating whether the `element` was found in the list and the index position of the element (or `-1` if not found). This matches the problem description.

3. **Search Logic**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value at each iteration. If the current value matches the `element`, the function immediately returns `True` and the index, fulfilling the requirement to return the index of the first occurrence of the element.

4. **Fallback Case**: If the loop completes without finding the `element`, the function returns `False` and `-1`, which also aligns with the problem description.

Given these points, the function behaves as required for all potential cases, making it correct according to the problem description.
