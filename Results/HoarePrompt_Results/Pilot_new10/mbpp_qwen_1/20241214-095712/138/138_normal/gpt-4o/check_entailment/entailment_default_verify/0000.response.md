Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The output hints are misleading because they only highlight specific cases (when the element is found at positions 0, 1, or 2), but the actual implementation of the function is more general. The function iterates through the entire array and checks each element against the target element, returning the correct tuple regardless of the position of the element in the array. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
