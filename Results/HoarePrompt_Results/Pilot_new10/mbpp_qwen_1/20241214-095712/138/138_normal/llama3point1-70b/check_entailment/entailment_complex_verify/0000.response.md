Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. The function uses the `index` method of the list to find the first occurrence of the element, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
