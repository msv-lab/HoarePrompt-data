Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Where the Exception Can Occur:**
   - The `try` block contains the line `index = array.index(element)`. This line attempts to find the index of `element` within the `array`.
   - A `ValueError` will be raised if `element` is not found in `array`.

2. **What the Try-Except Statement Accomplishes:**
   - If `element` is found in `array`, the `try` block executes, and the function returns `True` and the index of `element`.
   - If `element` is not found in `array`, the `except` block is executed, and the function returns `False` and `-1`.

3. **Summarize the Program's Output State After Execution:**
   - If `element` is found in `array`, the function returns `True` and the index of `element`.
   - If `element` is not found in `array`, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Based on this analysis, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **The function returns a tuple (boolean, integer). If `element` is found in `array`, the function returns (True, index), where `index` is the position of `element` in `array`. If `element` is not found in `array`, the function returns (False, -1).**
