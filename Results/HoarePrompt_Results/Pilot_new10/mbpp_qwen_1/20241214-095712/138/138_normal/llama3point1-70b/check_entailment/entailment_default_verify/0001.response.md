Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It searches for the given `element` in the `array` and returns a tuple with a boolean indicating whether the element is found and the index of the element (or -1 if not found). The output hints also confirm this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
