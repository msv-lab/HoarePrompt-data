The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a value to search within the array. If `element` is found in `array`, the function returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of `element` in `array`. If `element` is not found in `array`, the function returns a tuple `(False, -1)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `array` and a value `element`, and return a tuple indicating whether `element` is found in `array` and its index if found, or -1 if not found.
