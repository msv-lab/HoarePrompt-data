Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. It returns `True` and the index of the element if found, and `False` and `-1` if not found. This aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The annotations accurately describe the behavior of the function under different conditions, validating the original assessment.
