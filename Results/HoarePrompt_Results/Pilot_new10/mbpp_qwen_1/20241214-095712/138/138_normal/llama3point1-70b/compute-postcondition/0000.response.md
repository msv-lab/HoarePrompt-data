The code `index = array.index(element)` searches for the index of `element` in the list `array`. If `element` is found in `array`, `index` is assigned the index of `element`. If `element` is not found, a ValueError will be raised.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `array` or the exact value of `element`, we will assume the general case where `element` is found in `array`.

- `array` remains unchanged.
- `element` remains unchanged.
- `index` is assigned the index of `element` in `array`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` is a value to search within the array, `index` is the index of `element` in `array`**
