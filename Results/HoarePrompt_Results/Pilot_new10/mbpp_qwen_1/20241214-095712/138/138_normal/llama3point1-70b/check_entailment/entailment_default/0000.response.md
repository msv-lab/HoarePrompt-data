Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is found in the array and the index position of the element. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`. The `try` block uses the `index` method of the list to find the element and returns its index, while the `except` block catches the `ValueError` raised when the element is not found and returns `(False, -1)`. This approach handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
