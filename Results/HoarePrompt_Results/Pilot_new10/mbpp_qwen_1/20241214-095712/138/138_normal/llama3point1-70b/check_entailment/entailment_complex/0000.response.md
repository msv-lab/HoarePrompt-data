Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array` (a list of elements) and `element` (the value to search within the array).

2. **Search Logic**:
   - The `try` block uses the `index()` method to find the index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is found, it returns `True` and the index of the element.
   - The `except (ValueError)` block handles the case where the `element` is not found in the `array`. In this case, it returns `False` and `-1`.

3. **Return Value**: The function always returns a tuple `(boolean, integer)`, which matches the expected output format. If the `element` is found, it returns `(True, index)`, and if not found, it returns `(False, -1)`.

Since the program covers all potential cases (both when the element is found and when it is not found) and adheres to the specified return format, the program is correct.
