Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. It uses the `index` method of the list to find the first occurrence of the element, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for all potential cases.
