Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to keep track of both the index and value of each element. If the current element matches the target element, it immediately returns a tuple `(True, index)`. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. This approach ensures that the program works for every potential case and handles both the presence and absence of the target element in the array. All the provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the implementation.
