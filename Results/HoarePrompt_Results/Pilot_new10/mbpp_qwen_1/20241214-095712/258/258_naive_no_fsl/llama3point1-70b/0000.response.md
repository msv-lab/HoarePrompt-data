Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits). The function converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. Since the function works correctly for any positive integer and handles the calculation accurately, there is no known case where the function fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
