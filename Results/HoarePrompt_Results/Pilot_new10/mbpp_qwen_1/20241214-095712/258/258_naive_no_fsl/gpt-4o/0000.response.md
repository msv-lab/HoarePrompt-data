Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. This logic is correct and will work for all potential cases of Armstrong numbers.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `func_1(407)` returns `True` because \(4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3 = 407\).

Since the function passes these test cases and the logic is sound, it is correct for all potential cases.
