Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program checks if a number is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits and comparing it to the original number. However, this approach is incorrect because the function should compare the calculated sum to the original number `n`, but it returns `True` or `False` directly from the comparison. This means the function will always return `False` for any number that is not an Armstrong number, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this, the function should return `True` if the calculated sum equals the original number and `False` otherwise. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

The corrected function now correctly identifies Armstrong numbers.
