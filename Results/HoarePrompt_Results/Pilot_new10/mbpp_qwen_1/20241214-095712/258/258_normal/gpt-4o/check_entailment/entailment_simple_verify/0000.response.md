Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is incorrect. Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is an Armstrong number by comparing the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits to the original number. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if `armstrong_sum` equals `n` and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the intended functionality. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate, and the program is actually correct based on the problem description.
