Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly stated that the function is incorrect due to returning the result of the comparison directly. However, upon reviewing the code and the output hints, the function correctly checks if a number is an Armstrong number by comparing the calculated sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits to the original number. The function returns `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.
