Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong (or Narcissistic) number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The code converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. All the test cases provided (`153`, `259`, and `4458`) correctly return `True` and `False` respectively, which aligns with the definition of an Armstrong number. Therefore, the code works correctly for the described problem and all potential cases based on the provided examples.
