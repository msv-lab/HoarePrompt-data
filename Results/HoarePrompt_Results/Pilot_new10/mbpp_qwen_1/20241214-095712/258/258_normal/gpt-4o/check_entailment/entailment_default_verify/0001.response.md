Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. The logic in the function is sound: it converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. The test cases given (`func_1(153)`, `func_1(259)`, and `func_1(407)`) correctly demonstrate the functionality and correctness of the function. The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the function, confirming that the original assessment is correct.
