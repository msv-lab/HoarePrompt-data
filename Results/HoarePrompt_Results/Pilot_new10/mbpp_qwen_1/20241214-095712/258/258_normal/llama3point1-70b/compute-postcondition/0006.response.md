`sum` is incremented by the value of `digit` raised to the power of `num_len`. Since `digit` is a part of `num_str`, its value is not specified in the initial state. However, we know that `digit` is a single character from `num_str` and `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1. After converting `digit` to an integer using `int(digit)`, it is raised to the power of `num_len`.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is an integer
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1
- `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits of `num_str`

Let's assume `num_str` is "123" for illustration purposes. Then `num_len` would be 2 (since the length of "123" is 3, and 3 - 1 = 2). If `digit` is "1", then `int(digit)` would be 1, and the code would add \(1^2\) to `sum`.

However, since the exact `digit` is not specified, the general output state is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits of `num_str` with the additional value of the current digit raised to the power of `num_len`.**
