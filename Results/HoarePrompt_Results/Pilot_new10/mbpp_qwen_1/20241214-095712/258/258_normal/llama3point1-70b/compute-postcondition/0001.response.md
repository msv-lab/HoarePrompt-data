`num_len` is assigned the value of the length of `num_str`. The length of `num_str` is determined by the number of characters in the string representation of `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`**
