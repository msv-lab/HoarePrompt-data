Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment was not accurate. The provided code correctly implements the logic for checking if a number is an Armstrong number. The key issue identified in the original assessment was that the variable `num_len` should represent the number of digits in the number, which is correctly achieved by calculating the length of the string representation of the number (`len(num_str)`). The annotated version confirms that `num_len` is indeed the length of the string representation of `num`, which is the correct approach to determine the power to which each digit should be raised. Therefore, the program correctly identifies Armstrong numbers as intended.
