The code `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` will add the value of `int(digit) ** num_len` to the current value of `sum`. Here, `digit` is a substring of `num_str`, which represents a single digit of `num`. Let's assume `digit` is a single digit from `num_str` and proceed with the calculation.

Given:
- `num` is an integer.
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character.
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.
- `sum` is 0.

The code snippet `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` will change the value of `sum` to `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`.

Since `digit` is a single digit from `num_str` and `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, let's denote a generic example where `num_str` is "123" (for simplicity), so `num_len` is 3, and `digit` could be "1", "2", or "3".

For instance, if `digit` is "1":
- `int(digit)` would be `1`.
- `1 ** 3` would be `1`.
- `sum` would become `0 + 1 = 1`.

For another instance, if `digit` is "2":
- `int(digit)` would be `2`.
- `2 ** 3` would be `8`.
- `sum` would become `0 + 8 = 8`.

In general, the updated value of `sum` will be `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`**
