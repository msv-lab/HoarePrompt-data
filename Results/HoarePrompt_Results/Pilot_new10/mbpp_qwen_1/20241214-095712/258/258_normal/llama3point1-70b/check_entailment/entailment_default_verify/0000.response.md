Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not accurately implement the logic for Armstrong numbers. The issue lies in the fact that the variable `num_len` should represent the number of digits in the number, which can be obtained by converting the number to a string and getting its length. However, the current implementation uses `num_len` incorrectly, leading to incorrect results. The output hints confirm that the function is calculating the sum of the digits raised to the power of the length of the string representation of the number, rather than the number of digits. This discrepancy means the original assessment is accurate.
