Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is correct. While the provided function `func_1` appears to correctly check if a number is an Armstrong number, it does not handle cases where the input is not a positive integer. The problem description specifically asks for a function to check whether the given number is an Armstrong number, and the function should ideally raise an error or return a specific message if the input is invalid. Since the function does not handle such cases, the original assessment is not accurate. Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the problem description.
