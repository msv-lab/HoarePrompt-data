Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong (or Narcissistic) number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` as input.
2. **Conversion and Length Calculation**: It converts the number to a string (`num_str`) to easily iterate over each digit and calculates the length of this string (`num_len`), which represents the number of digits in the original number.
3. **Sum Calculation**: A variable `sum` is initialized to 0. The program then iterates over each character in `num_str`, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds the result to `sum`.
4. **Comparison and Return**: After the loop, the program compares the calculated `sum` with the original `num`. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, ensuring it works for any non-negative integer input. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
