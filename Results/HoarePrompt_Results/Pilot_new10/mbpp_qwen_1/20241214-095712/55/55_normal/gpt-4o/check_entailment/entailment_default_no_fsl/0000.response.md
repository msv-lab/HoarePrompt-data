Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any separators. The assertions provided also match this behavior, confirming that the function works as expected for the given examples. Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases beyond the examples, and the code handles the provided examples correctly, the program meets the requirements for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
