Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings based on the problem description and the given output hints. The function `func_1` processes the input string by splitting it at underscores, capitalizing each resulting component, and then joining them back together without any separators. This behavior matches the expectations for converting snake case to camel case as described in the problem statement and output hints.
