Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings as demonstrated by the provided test cases. The annotation accurately describes the state and behavior of the program, confirming that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
