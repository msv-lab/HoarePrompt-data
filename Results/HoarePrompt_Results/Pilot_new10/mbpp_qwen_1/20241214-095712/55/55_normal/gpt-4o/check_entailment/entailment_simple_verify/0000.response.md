Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings by splitting the input string at underscores, capitalizing each resulting component, and then joining them together. The provided assertions and the annotated code both support the conclusion that the function operates as intended based on the problem description. There are no issues or edge cases highlighted in the annotations that would make the original assessment inaccurate.
