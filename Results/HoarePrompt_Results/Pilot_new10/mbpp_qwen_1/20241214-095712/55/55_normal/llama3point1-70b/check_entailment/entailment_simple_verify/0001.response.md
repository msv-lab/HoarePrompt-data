Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It handles edge cases such as empty strings, strings with only underscores, and strings with no underscores appropriately. The original assessment correctly states that the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
