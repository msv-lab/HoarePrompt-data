`words` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` at each underscore. The code joins these words together with each word capitalized (except the first one). Since `snake_case_str` is no longer available, we focus on the transformation of `words` into `camel_case_str`.

The code `camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)` does the following:
- It iterates over each word in `words`.
- Each word is capitalized using `word.capitalize()`.
- These capitalized words are joined together without any separator.

Since `words` is the only variable affected and its value is transformed, the output state is:

Output State: **`camel_case_str` is the string obtained by capitalizing each word in `words` and joining them together, `words` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` at each underscore**
