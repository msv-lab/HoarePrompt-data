You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
Program:
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str


```
Output hints: Let's analyze the provided annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function `func_1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The function accepts a parameter `snake_case_str`, which is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores (`_`).

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The function splits `snake_case_str` using the underscore character (`_`) as the delimiter, resulting in a list of words stored in the variable `words`.
   - Each word in the list `words` is capitalized using the `capitalize()` method.
   - These capitalized words are then joined together without any separators to form a new string `camel_case_str`.
   - The function returns the resulting `camel_case_str`.

3. **Return Postconditions:**
   - The function returns the string obtained by capitalizing each word in `words` and joining them together.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:

- **Edge Case:** The input string `snake_case_str` might be empty.
  - If `snake_case_str` is empty, the split operation will result in an empty list `words`. Joining an empty list of capitalized words will result in an empty string.
- **Edge Case:** The input string `snake_case_str` might contain only underscores.
  - If `snake_case_str` contains only underscores, the split operation will still result in an empty list `words`. Joining an empty list of capitalized words will result in an empty string.
- **Edge Case:** The input string `snake_case_str` might contain no underscores at all.
  - If `snake_case_str` contains no underscores, the split operation will result in a list with a single element, which is the entire string. Capitalizing this single element and joining it will return the original string with the first letter capitalized.

### Summary of Functionality:

The function `func_1` takes a string `snake_case_str` as input, which consists of lowercase letters and underscores. It splits the string into words based on underscores, capitalizes each word, and then joins the capitalized words back together without any separators. If the input string is empty or contains only underscores, the function returns an empty string. If the input string contains no underscores, the function returns the original string with the first letter capitalized.

### Final Summary:

**The function accepts a string `snake_case_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, splits it into words, capitalizes each word, and joins them together. If the input string is empty or contains only underscores, it returns an empty string. If the input string contains no underscores, it returns the original string with the first letter capitalized.**

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
