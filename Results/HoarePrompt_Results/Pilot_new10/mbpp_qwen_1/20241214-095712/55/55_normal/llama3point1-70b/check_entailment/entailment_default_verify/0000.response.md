Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string by splitting the string at underscores, capitalizing each word, and joining them together. The output hints confirm that the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
