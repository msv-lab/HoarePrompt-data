Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string for all potential cases described in the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Empty String**: If the input string is empty (`""`), the function will split an empty string, resulting in an empty list. Joining an empty list of capitalized words will produce an empty string, which is correct.
2. **String with Only Underscores**: If the input string contains only underscores (e.g., `"__"`), splitting the string will result in an empty list. Joining an empty list of capitalized words will again produce an empty string, which is correct.
3. **String with No Underscores**: If the input string contains no underscores (e.g., `"hello"`), the function will split the string into a list with a single element. Capitalizing this element and joining it will result in `"Hello"`, which is the expected output.
4. **General Case**: For any valid snake case string (e.g., `"hello_world"`), the function correctly splits the string, capitalizes each word, and joins them together to form `"HelloWorld"`, which is the expected output.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly, the program is correct according to the problem description.
