You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
Program:
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str


```
Output hints: Let's analyze the provided annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function `func_1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The function accepts a parameter `snake_case_str`, which is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores (`_`).

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The function splits `snake_case_str` using the underscore character (`_`) as the delimiter, resulting in a list of words stored in the variable `words`.
   - Each word in the list `words` is capitalized using the `capitalize()` method.
   - These capitalized words are then joined together without any separators to form a new string `camel_case_str`.
   - The function returns the resulting `camel_case_str`.

3. **Return Postconditions:**
   - The function returns the string obtained by capitalizing each word in `words` and joining them together.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:

- **Edge Case:** The input string `snake_case_str` might be empty.
  - If `snake_case_str` is empty, the split operation will result in an empty list `words`. Joining an empty list of capitalized words will result in an empty string.
- **Edge Case:** The input string `snake_case_str` might contain only underscores.
  - If `snake_case_str` contains only underscores, the split operation will still result in an empty list `words`. Joining an empty list of capitalized words will result in an empty string.
- **Edge Case:** The input string `snake_case_str` might contain no underscores at all.
  - If `snake_case_str` contains no underscores, the split operation will result in a list with a single element, which is the entire string. Capitalizing this single element and joining it will return the original string with the first letter capitalized.

### Summary of Functionality:

The function `func_1` takes a string `snake_case_str` as input, which consists of lowercase letters and underscores. It splits the string into words based on underscores, capitalizes each word, and then joins the capitalized words back together without any separators. If the input string is empty or contains only underscores, the function returns an empty string. If the input string contains no underscores, the function returns the original string with the first letter capitalized.

### Final Summary:

**The function accepts a string `snake_case_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, splits it into words, capitalizes each word, and joins them together. If the input string is empty or contains only underscores, it returns an empty string. If the input string contains no underscores, it returns the original string with the first letter capitalized.**

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
