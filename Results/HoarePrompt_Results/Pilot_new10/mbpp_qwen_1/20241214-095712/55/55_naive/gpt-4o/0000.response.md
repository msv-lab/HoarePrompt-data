Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together. Based on the examples given:

- `func_1('python_program')` returns `'PythonProgram'`
- `func_1('python_language')` returns `'PythonLanguage'`
- `func_1('programming_language')` returns `'ProgrammingLanguage'`

The program handles the transformation as expected in all provided cases and seems to cover the basic requirements without any edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
