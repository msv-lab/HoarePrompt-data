Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the snake case string by underscores, capitalizes each word, and joins them together without any spaces. This approach handles all potential cases where the input string can contain multiple words separated by underscores, and the function correctly processes them to form a valid camel case string. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
