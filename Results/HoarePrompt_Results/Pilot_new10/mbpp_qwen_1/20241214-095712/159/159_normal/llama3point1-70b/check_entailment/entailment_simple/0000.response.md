Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the formula for finding the volume of a cone. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are expected to be non-negative numbers (as stated in the state of the program right before the function call). The function then calculates the volume of the cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone, and the provided function correctly uses the mathematical formula for this calculation, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
