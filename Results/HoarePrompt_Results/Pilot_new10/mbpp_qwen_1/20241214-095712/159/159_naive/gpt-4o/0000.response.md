Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. The provided test cases use `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance to check the correctness of the function. Given the provided test cases and the formula, the function appears to be correct for the given inputs. Since no edge cases or incorrect behaviors have been identified, the program is considered correct.
