Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input.
2. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will hold the cumulative sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients.
3. It iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), checking if the current index `i` is even using the condition `if i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to `sum`.
4. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum`.

This process ensures that the function calculates the sum of binomial coefficients for all even indices from 0 to `n`. The mathematical basis for this solution can be derived from properties of binomial coefficients and symmetry in Pascal's triangle. Specifically, the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for a given row `n` in Pascal's triangle is equal to \(2^{n-1}\). However, the implementation here directly sums the values, which is valid and correct according to the problem description.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
