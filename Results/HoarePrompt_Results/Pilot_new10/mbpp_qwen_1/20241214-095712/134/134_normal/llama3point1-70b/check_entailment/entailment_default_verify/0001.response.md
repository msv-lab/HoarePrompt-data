Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The function `func_1` iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index \( i \) is even, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum. The output hints also confirm that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`. Since the program works correctly for all tested cases and the logic matches the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
