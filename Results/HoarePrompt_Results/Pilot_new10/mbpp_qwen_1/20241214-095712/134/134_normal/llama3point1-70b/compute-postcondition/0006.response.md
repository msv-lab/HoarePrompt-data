The code `sum += math.comb(n, i)` impacts the value of `sum`. Since `i` is an odd integer and `math.comb(n, i)` is calculated and added to `sum`, the updated value of `sum` will be the original `sum` plus `math.comb(n, i)`. The value of `i` is incremented to an odd number but its exact value is not specified. The precondition that `i` is now an odd number remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is an odd integer, `sum` is the original sum plus `math.comb(n, i)`**
