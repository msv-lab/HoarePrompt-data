Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`.** 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
   - The condition `if i % 2 == 0:` checks if `i` is even.
   - If `i` is even, `sum` is updated by adding `math.comb(n, i)` to it.

2. **Iteration Analysis**:
   - After the loop executes once (`i = 0`), `sum` is updated by adding `math.comb(n, 0)` (which is `1`).
   - After the loop executes twice (`i = 1`), since `1` is odd, the condition `i % 2 == 0` fails, so `sum` remains unchanged.
   - After the loop executes three times (`i = 2`), `i` is even, so `sum` is updated by adding `math.comb(n, 2)`.
   - This pattern continues until `i = n`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n`.
   - `sum` will be the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from `0` to `n`.

4. **Non-execution Case**:
   - If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute at all, so `i` remains `0` and `sum` remains `0`.

Thus, the final output state is that `i` will be `n + 1` and `sum` will be the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from `0` to `n`.
