Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`.** 

This summary covers the following:
- The function iterates through all integers from 0 to `n` inclusive.
- For each even integer `i`, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.
- The final sum is returned after the loop completes.

No potential edge cases or missing functionality were found based on the provided code and annotations.
