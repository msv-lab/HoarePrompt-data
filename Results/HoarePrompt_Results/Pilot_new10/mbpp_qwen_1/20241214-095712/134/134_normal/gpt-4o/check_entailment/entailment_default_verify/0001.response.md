Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` to calculate \(2^{(n-1)}\), which matches the problem description of finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The output hints correctly summarize the functionality of the function, indicating that it accepts a positive integer \(n\) and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\). The test cases provided also validate this implementation, confirming its correctness for the given inputs.
