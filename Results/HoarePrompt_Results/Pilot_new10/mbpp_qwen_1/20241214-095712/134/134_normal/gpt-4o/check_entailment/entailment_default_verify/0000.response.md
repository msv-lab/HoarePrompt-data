Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \), which aligns with the mathematical property of binomial coefficients. The program handles all provided test cases correctly, and the assumptions in the output hints are consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given requirements.
