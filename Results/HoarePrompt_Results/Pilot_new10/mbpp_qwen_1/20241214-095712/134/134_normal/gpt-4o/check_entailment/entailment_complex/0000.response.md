Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should take a positive integer \( n \) and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients. It turns out that the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given \( n \) is indeed \( 2^{(n-1)} \). 

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a positive integer \( n \) and returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \). The provided assertions also validate this behavior:

- For \( n = 4 \), the sum of even index binomial coefficients is \( 2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8 \).
- For \( n = 6 \), the sum of even index binomial coefficients is \( 2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), the sum of even index binomial coefficients is \( 2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2 \).

Since the function consistently returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \) for any positive integer \( n \), it correctly fulfills the requirement specified in the problem description.
