Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` is designed to calculate \(2^{(n-1)}\), which matches the problem description of finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The provided test cases confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
