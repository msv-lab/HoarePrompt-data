Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). According to the properties of binomial coefficients, the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of \( (1 + x)^n \) is equal to \( 2^{n-1} \). The program uses this property to return \( 2^{n-1} \), which matches the problem description. All the provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program works as expected for the given problem description and all potential cases.
