Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and divides the product by the length of the list. The assertions in the code cover several cases including positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of both. The function handles these cases correctly without any issues. Given the nature of the operations (multiplication and division) and the provided test cases, it seems the function works as expected for the described problem. Therefore, no counterexample was found, and the program is correct.
