Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This logic aligns with the problem description and works for all potential cases, including empty lists (where it returns 0) and lists with positive, negative, and floating-point numbers. The function handles all these cases as specified, so the correctness is True.
