`product` is initially set to the second element of `numbers`. The code multiplies `product` by `num`, which is the first element of `numbers`. Therefore, the new value of `product` is the product of the first and second elements of `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floating-point numbers that must have at least one element; `product` is the product of the first and second elements of `numbers`.**
