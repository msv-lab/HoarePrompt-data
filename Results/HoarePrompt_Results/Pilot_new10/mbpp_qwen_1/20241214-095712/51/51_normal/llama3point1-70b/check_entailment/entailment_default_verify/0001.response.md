Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a list of integers or floating-point numbers and returning the correct result. Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and there are no edge cases or potential inputs mentioned that would cause it to fail, the original assessment is accurate.
