`product` is multiplied by `num`. The value of `num` is taken from the list `numbers`. Since the initial value of `product` is 1, multiplying it by any number `num` in the list will result in `product` being updated to that number `num`. The state of the list `numbers` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floating-point numbers that must have at least one element, `product` is the first element of `numbers`**
