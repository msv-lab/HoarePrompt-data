Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function handles a list of integers or floating-point numbers as expected and returns the correct result. There are no issues identified that would make the original assessment incorrect.
