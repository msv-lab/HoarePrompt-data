Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and divides the product by the length of the list. However, the output hints indicate that the function returns `None`. This is incorrect because the function actually returns the calculated average product, not `None`. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
