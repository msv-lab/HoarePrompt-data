Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment concluded that the program is correct, but upon reviewing the annotated code, it appears there is an issue with the return statement in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the comment indicates that `result` is not defined and the function returns `None`. This contradicts the problem description, which requires the function to return the product of all numbers in the list divided by the length of the list. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the function does not correctly implement the required behavior.
