`product` is multiplied by `num`. The value of `product` was initially 1, and `num` is an integer from the list `numbers`. After multiplying `product` by `num`, the new value of `product` will be the original value of `product` (which is 1) multiplied by the value of `num`.

Output State: **`product` is `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer**
