Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to meet the problem description. It multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The assertions provided also seem to validate the function for different scenarios:

1. The first assertion checks a list with both positive and negative numbers.
2. The second assertion checks a list with negative numbers only.
3. The third assertion checks a list with positive numbers only.

Since the function behaves as expected in these cases and there are no obvious edge cases or logical flaws identified, we can conclude that the program is correct.
