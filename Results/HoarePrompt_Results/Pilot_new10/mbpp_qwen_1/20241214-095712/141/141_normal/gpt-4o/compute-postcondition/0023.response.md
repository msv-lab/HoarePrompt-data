Postcondition: ***`digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `count` must be less than the corresponding digit in `frequency`. If `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
