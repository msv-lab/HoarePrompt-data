Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The logic within the function is sound, and the provided test cases are correct. Therefore, the original assessment of the function being correct is accurate.
