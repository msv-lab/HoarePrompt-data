The code `frequency[digit] = 1` sets the value of `frequency[digit]` to 1. Given the initial state where `digit` is already in `frequency`, its count would be incremented by one; otherwise, `digit` is added to `frequency` with a count of 1, the condition that `digit` is already in `frequency` does not hold here since the code explicitly sets the count to 1.

Therefore, the value of `digit` is added to `frequency` with a count of 1.

Output State: **`digit_str` must contain at least one character, `digit` is added to `frequency` with a count of 1**
