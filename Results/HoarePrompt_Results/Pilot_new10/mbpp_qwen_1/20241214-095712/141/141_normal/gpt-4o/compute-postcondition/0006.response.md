The code `frequency[digit] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `digit` in the dictionary `frequency`. Since `digit_str` must contain at least one character and the digit specified is not in the frequency dictionary, this means that `digit` is a new key being added to the dictionary with a value of `1`.

Output State: **`digit_str` must contain at least one character, and the digit specified is not in the frequency dictionary; `frequency[digit]` is 1**
