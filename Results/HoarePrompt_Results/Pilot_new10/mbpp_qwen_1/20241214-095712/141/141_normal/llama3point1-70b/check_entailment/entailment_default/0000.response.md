Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the integer contains a zero digit. For instance, consider the input `n = 102`. The digit `0` appears once, but according to the problem description, the frequency of each digit should be less than or equal to the digit itself. Since there is no digit `0` in the range `[1, 9]`, the function should still return `True`. However, the current implementation counts the occurrences of `0` and checks if this count is less than or equal to `0`, which is always true, but it misses the overall constraint that each digit's frequency should not exceed its value. This oversight leads to incorrect results for certain inputs containing zeros.
