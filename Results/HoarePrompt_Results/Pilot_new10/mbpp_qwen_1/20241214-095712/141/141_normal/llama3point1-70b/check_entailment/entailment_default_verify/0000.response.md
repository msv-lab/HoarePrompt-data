Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly states that the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description. The provided function checks the frequency of each digit in the integer but the condition should be the frequency of the digit should be less than or equal to the digit itself, not the next digit. The output hints mention "the integer value of the next digit," which is incorrect. For example, for `n = 332`, the function should return `False` because the digit '3' appears twice, but 2 is not greater than or equal to 3. The function fails to meet this requirement, making the original assessment inaccurate.
