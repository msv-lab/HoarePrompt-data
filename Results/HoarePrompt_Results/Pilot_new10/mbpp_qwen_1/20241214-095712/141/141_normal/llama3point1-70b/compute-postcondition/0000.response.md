The code `str_n = str(n)` converts the non-negative integer `n` to a string and assigns it to `str_n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is a string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is a string representation of `n`**
