Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
2. **Program Logic**: The program iterates over each digit in the string representation of the number (`str_n`) and checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. However, the logic in the for loop is flawed because it uses the `count()` method, which counts occurrences of the digit throughout the entire string, not just up to the current position.

### Example to illustrate the issue:
Consider the input `n = 3213`.

- The string representation is `"3213"`.
- When the loop processes the first digit `'3'`, it checks `str_n.count('3') == 2` (which is true).
- Then, when processing the second digit `'2'`, it checks `str_n.count('2') == 1` (which is true).
- Finally, when processing the third digit `'1'`, it checks `str_n.count('1') == 1` (which is true).

However, this logic does not meet the problem description. It should check if the count of each digit up to the current position is less than or equal to the digit itself. For instance, for the digit `'3'`, we should only consider its occurrences up to the position where we encounter the next `'3'`, not the total count of `'3'` in the entire string.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the logic, you would need to keep track of the position as you iterate through the digits and ensure that the count of the digit from the start to the current position is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    length = len(str_n)
    
    for i in range(length):
        digit = str_n[i]
        if int(digit) < i + 1 or str_n[:i+1].count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This implementation ensures that the count is checked up to the current position, thus meeting the problem description accurately.
