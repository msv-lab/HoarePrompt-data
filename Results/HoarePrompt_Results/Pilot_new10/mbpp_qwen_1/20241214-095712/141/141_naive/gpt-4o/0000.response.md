Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function converts the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and then verifies the condition. All the provided test cases also indicate that the function works as expected:

- `func_1(1234)` returns `True`, which is correct because all digits' frequencies (1, 1, 1, 1) are less than or equal to the digits themselves.
- `func_1(51241)` returns `False`, which is correct because the digit '5' appears only once but its frequency (1) is not less than or equal to 5.
- `func_1(321)` returns `True`, which is correct because all digits' frequencies (1, 1, 1) are less than or equal to the digits themselves.

Since the function passes all the provided test cases and the logic appears sound, we can conclude that the function is correct for the given problem description.
