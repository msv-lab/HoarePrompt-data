Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of integer elements in the given list. This approach is correct because `isinstance(x, int)` will evaluate to `True` for integer elements and `False` otherwise, and `sum` will count the number of `True` values, which correspond to the integer elements in the list. This method works for all potential cases without any edge cases being missed.
