Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integer elements in the list. This is achieved by using the `sum` function along with a generator expression that evaluates whether each element `x` in the list `lst` is an instance of the `int` class using `isinstance(x, int)`. 

- When `isinstance(x, int)` evaluates to `True` for an element `x`, it contributes `1` to the sum.
- When `isinstance(x, int)` evaluates to `False`, it contributes `0` to the sum.

Thus, the sum of all these boolean values gives the total count of integer elements in the list. This approach works for any list input and correctly counts the number of integer elements, making the program correct according to the problem description.
