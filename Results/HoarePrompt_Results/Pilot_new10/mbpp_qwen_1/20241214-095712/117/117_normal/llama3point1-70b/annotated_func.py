#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of True values (which represent integers) from the expression `isinstance(x, int)` for each element `x` in the list `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements in the list.
