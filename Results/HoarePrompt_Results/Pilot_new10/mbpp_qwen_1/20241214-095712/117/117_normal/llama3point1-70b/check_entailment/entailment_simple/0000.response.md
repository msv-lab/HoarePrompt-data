Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the number of integer elements in that list. This is achieved using the `sum` function in combination with a generator expression that evaluates whether each element `x` in the list `lst` is an instance of the `int` class using `isinstance(x, int)`. 

- When `isinstance(x, int)` evaluates to `True`, it contributes `1` to the sum.
- When it evaluates to `False`, it contributes `0` to the sum.

Since the sum of these `True` and `False` values effectively counts the number of integer elements in the list, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description for any potential input list. Therefore, the program is correct.
