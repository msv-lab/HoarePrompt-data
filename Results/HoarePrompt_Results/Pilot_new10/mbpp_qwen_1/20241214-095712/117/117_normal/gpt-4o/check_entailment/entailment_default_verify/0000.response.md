Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The output hints also accurately summarize the functionality of the function. The original assessment is accurate because the function behaves as expected for all the provided test cases and the general logic used (checking if each element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance`) is sound. There is no indication from the given information that the function does not handle all potential cases correctly.
