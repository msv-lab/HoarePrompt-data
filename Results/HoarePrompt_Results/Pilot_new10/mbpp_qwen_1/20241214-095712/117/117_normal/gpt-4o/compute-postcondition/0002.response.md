Let's analyze the annotated code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `lst` is a list of elements.
2. **Code Execution**:
   - The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`.
   - For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is an instance of the `int` class using `isinstance(x, int)`.
   - If `x` is an integer, it yields `1`.
   - The `sum()` function then sums up all the `1`s yielded by the generator expression, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list `lst`.

3. **Return Postconditions**: The function returns the sum of 1 for each integer element in the list `lst`.

4. **Annotations vs. Actual Code**: The annotation mentions returning the sum of 1 for each integer element, which aligns with the actual code behavior. There are no apparent discrepancies between the code and the annotations.

5. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If the list `lst` contains no integer elements, the function will return `0`.
   - If the list `lst` is empty, the function will also return `0`.
   - If the list `lst` contains non-integer elements, they will be ignored, and the function will still count only the integer elements.

Given the analysis, we can summarize the functionality of the function as follows:

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements in the list.**
