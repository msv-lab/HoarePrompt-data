Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns the count of integer elements within that list. The implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list, checking if it is an instance of the `int` type using `isinstance(x, int)`. For each integer element, it yields 1, and `sum` aggregates these values to produce the total count of integers in the list.

The provided test cases also confirm the correctness:
- `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` should return 2 (since there are two integer elements: 1 and 2).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` should return 3 (all three elements are integers).
- `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` should return 2 (only 1 and 4 are integers).

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the test cases validate its functionality, the program is correct.
