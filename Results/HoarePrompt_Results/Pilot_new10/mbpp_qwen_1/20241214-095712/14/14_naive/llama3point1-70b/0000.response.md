Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicates from the array. Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, if the length of the set is less than the length of the original array, it means there were duplicates. This logic correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements. There doesn't appear to be any edge case that this program would fail for, given that it works correctly for both empty arrays and arrays with unique and duplicate elements.
