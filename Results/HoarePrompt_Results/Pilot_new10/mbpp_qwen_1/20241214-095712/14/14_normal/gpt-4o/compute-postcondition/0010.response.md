According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least two integers, and `seen` contains `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still contain at least one integer, and `seen` must still contain `num`.

Let's break it down:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` contains at least two integers.
2. The loop variable `num` was part of `arr` during the last iteration.
3. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must contain at least one integer (since if it's empty, the loop won't continue).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `arr` must contain at least one integer, and `seen` must still contain `num`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one integer, `seen` is a set containing `num`**
