Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements. The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function uses a set to track seen numbers and returns `True` if a duplicate is found or `False` otherwise. The original assessment correctly notes that the function works as intended for the given test cases and covers the necessary logic for identifying duplicates. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
