State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is an empty set.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using the variable `num`.

2. **Determine Initial Values**: For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one integer. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `arr` must have at least one integer to ensure the loop body runs at least once.
   - `num` should be the first element of `arr` for the first iteration of the loop.
   - Since `seen` is used within the loop, we don't need to explicitly adjust its state for the loop to start, but we should note that it remains an empty set.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one integer, `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `seen` is an empty set**
