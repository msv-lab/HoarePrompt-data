Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code uses the length comparison between the original array and its set conversion to determine if there are duplicates. This approach works correctly in most cases, but it fails to handle the case where the input array is empty. For an empty array, both `len(arr)` and `len(set(arr))` would return 0, which would incorrectly return `False`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
