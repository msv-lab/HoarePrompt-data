Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements. The logic of comparing the lengths of the array and its corresponding set to check for duplicates is sound. The original assessment correctly identifies the program as accurate based on the problem description and the provided code.
