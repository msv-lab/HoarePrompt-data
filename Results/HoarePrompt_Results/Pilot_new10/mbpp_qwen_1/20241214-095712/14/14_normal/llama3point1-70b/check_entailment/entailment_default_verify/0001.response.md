Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is not accurate because while the function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence of duplicate elements in an array by comparing the lengths of the array and its corresponding set, it does not explicitly state or ensure that the input is a list of integers. According to the problem description, the function should specifically identify duplicate elements in an array of integers. However, the provided function does not check if the input is indeed a list of integers, which could lead to incorrect behavior if non-integer types are passed as input. Since the problem description specifies that the input should be an array of integers, the function needs to validate this before performing the operation. Therefore, the original assessment does not account for this critical aspect, making it inaccurate.
