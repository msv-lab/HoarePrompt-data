The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. According to the code, the function returns `True` if the length of the list `arr` is not equal to the length of the set of `arr`, indicating that there are duplicate elements in the list. Conversely, it returns `False` if the lengths are equal, meaning all elements in the list are unique.

To summarize, the function checks for the presence of duplicate elements in the list by comparing the length of the list to the length of its set form. If the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of duplicates, and the function returns `True`. If they are the same, the function returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns `True` if there are duplicate elements in the list, and `False` if all elements are unique.**
