Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements.
2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`arr`) as input and returns a boolean value.
3. **Logic**: The function uses the property that converting a list to a set removes all duplicates. Therefore, if the lengths of the original list and the converted set are different, it means there were duplicates in the list.
4. **Return Value**: 
   - If `len(arr)` is not equal to `len(set(arr))`, the function returns `True`, indicating the presence of duplicates.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating no duplicates.

Since the logic correctly identifies the presence of duplicates by comparing the lengths of the list and its set conversion, the program always meets the requirement specified in the problem description for any given input.
