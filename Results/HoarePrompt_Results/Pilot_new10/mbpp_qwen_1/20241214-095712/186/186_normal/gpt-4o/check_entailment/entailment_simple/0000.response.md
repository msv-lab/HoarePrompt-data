Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should extract the element-wise differences between the given two tuples. However, the program uses the bitwise AND operator `&` instead of performing element-wise subtraction. 

Here is a detailed breakdown:

- Problem Description: The function should take two tuples as input and return a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.
- Provided Program: The program uses `a & b` which performs a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the tuples. This is not the same as subtracting the elements.

For example, consider the first assertion:
```python
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
```
- Expected output based on the problem description: `(10 - 5, 4 - 2, 6 - 3, 9 - 3) = (5, 2, 3, 6)`
- Actual output: `(10 & 5, 4 & 2, 6 & 3, 9 & 3) = (0, 0, 2, 1)`

The program's output is incorrect because it uses bitwise AND instead of subtraction. To meet the problem description, the function should be modified to perform element-wise subtraction:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

With this modification, the function will correctly return the element-wise differences between the tuples.
