Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided problem description asks to extract the element-wise values from the given two tuples. However, the function `func_1` is performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the tuples instead of simply returning the elements themselves.

The problem description should ideally state something like:
"Write a function to return the corresponding elements from the given two tuples."

The function provided, however, performs a bitwise AND operation on the elements, which is not what the problem description asks for. For example, if the input tuples are `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected output would be `(10, 4, 6, 9)` but the function will return `(0, 0, 2, 1)` due to the bitwise AND operation.

To meet the problem description, the function should be:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a for a in tuple1)
```

This version of the function will correctly return the elements of `tuple1` as required by the problem description.
