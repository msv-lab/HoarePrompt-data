Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` uses the bitwise AND operation between elements of the two tuples, which does not align with the problem description that asks to extract elements from the tuples. The output hints also support this, indicating that the function performs a bitwise AND operation rather than extracting elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the given problem description.
