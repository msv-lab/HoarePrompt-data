Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. However, the problem description asks to extract the elements from the given tuples, which implies returning the elements themselves rather than their bitwise AND results. The original assessment correctly identifies this discrepancy. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
