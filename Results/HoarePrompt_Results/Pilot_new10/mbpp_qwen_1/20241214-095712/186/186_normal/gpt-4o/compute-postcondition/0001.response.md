The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples with the same length. The function returns a tuple where each element is the intersection of the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2` with the same length, and return a tuple where each element is the intersection of the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
