Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two tuples, which does not align with the problem description asking for "elementwise" extraction and handling of tuples. The output hints confirm this behavior, indicating that the function returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. This behavior is different from simply returning the tuples or extracting specific elements, as implied by the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the function being incorrect is valid.
