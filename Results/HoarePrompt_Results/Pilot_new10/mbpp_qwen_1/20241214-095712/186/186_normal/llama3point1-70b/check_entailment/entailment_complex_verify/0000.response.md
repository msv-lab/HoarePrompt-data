Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version confirms that the program performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. This operation does not align with the problem description, which asks to extract the element-wise and tuples (implying a Cartesian product or combination of elements). The bitwise AND operation is a different operation and does not produce the desired output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
