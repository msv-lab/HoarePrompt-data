Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples using a generator expression within a tuple constructor. However, the problem description asks to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples," which implies extracting the elements themselves rather than performing a bitwise operation.

For example, if the input tuples are `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`, the expected output would simply be the concatenation of the two tuples, i.e., `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`. Instead, the provided code will perform bitwise AND operations on the elements, resulting in `(0, 0, 0)` since the binary representation of `1 & 4` is `0`, `2 & 5` is `0`, and `3 & 6` is `0`.

To fix this, the code should be revised to concatenate the two tuples, like so:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tup1 + tup2
```
