Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version clearly shows that the function performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. However, the problem description asks for "elementwise" extraction and handling of tuples, which typically implies returning the tuples themselves or specific elements from them, not performing bitwise operations. Since the function does not align with the problem description, the original assessment of incorrectness is accurate.
