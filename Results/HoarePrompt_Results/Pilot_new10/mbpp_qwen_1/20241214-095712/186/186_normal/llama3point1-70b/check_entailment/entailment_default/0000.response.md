Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples using a generator expression within a tuple. However, the problem description asks to extract elements and tuples, which suggests returning a tuple containing the original tuples rather than performing a bitwise AND operation.

The function `func_1` should return a tuple containing `tup1` and `tup2` directly, like so:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return (tup1, tup2)
```

The current implementation does not meet the problem description and performs an operation that was not specified, hence the correctness is **False**.
