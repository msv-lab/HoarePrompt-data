Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` attempts to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two tuples using a generator expression. However, the problem description asks for "elementwise" extraction and handling of tuples, which typically means extracting elements from the tuples rather than performing operations on them.

The function's current implementation uses a bitwise AND operation (`&`), which is not what the problem description suggests. A correct approach would be to simply return the tuples themselves or extract specific elements as required by the problem description.

For example, if the problem description was to return the two tuples as they are, the function should be:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tup1, tup2
```

Since the given function does not match the described behavior and performs an unintended operation, the correctness is **False**.
