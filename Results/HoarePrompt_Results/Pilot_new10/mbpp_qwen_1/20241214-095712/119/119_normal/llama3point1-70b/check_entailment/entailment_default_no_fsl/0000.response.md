Correctness: True

Explanation: The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order, which matches the problem description. The function works for every potential case where `a` and `b` can be any integers or floats. There are no edge cases or conditions missing from the implementation.
