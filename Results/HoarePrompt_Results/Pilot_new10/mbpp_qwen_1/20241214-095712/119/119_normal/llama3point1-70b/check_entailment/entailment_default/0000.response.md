Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order. The provided problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The function `func_1` exactly implements this behavior. There are no edge cases or conditions that this function would fail under the given problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
