Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the step-by-step analysis confirm that the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. This behavior matches the problem description for any pair of input numbers. Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail according to the given problem statement, the original assessment is accurate.
