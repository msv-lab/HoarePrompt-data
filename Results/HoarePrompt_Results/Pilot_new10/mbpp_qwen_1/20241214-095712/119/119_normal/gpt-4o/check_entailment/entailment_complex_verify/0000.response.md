Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input parameters and returns them as a tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be integers or floats, and returns them in the order of `b` followed by `a`. The assertions provided in the code also correctly test the function with various inputs, demonstrating that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
