#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns `b` and `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be integers or floats, and returns them in the order of `b` followed by `a`.
