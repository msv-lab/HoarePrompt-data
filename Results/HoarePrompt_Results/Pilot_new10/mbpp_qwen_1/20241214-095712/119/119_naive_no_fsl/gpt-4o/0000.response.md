Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The function implementation `return (b, a)` correctly achieves this. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since the function behaves correctly for the described behavior and no edge cases were found where it fails, the program is correct.
