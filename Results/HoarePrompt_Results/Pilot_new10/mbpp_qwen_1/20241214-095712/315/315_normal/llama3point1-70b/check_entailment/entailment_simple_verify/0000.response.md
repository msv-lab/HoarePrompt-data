Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and a list converted from the input tuple. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires adding the given tuple to the given list. The original assessment is accurate because the function performs the required operation correctly under the assumption of valid input.
