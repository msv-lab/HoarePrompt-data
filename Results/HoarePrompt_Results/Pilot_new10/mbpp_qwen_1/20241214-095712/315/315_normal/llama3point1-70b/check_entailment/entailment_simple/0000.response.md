Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `input_list`, which is expected to be a list, and `input_tuple`, which is expected to be a tuple. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and a list converted from `input_tuple`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function accepts `input_list` (a list) and `input_tuple` (a tuple), as required by the problem description.
2. **Conversion and Concatenation**: Inside the function, `input_tuple` is converted to a list using `list(input_tuple)`. Then, this list is concatenated with `input_list` using the `+` operator, resulting in a new list.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns this new concatenated list, which fulfills the requirement of adding the given tuple to the given list.

Since the program consistently performs the described operation for any valid input list and tuple, it is correct according to the problem description.
