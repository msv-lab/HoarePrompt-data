Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly adds the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the input list. The function `func_1` takes a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, converts `input_tuple` to a list using `list(input_tuple)`, and then concatenates it with `input_list` using the `+` operator. This operation results in a new list that contains all elements of `input_list` followed by all elements of `input_tuple`.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the function performs the required operation correctly for every potential case. There are no edge cases or specific examples provided in the hints that indicate the function does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the function is correct.
