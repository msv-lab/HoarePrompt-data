Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the converted tuple to a list. The original assessment is accurate because the provided function meets the requirements specified in the problem description without any issues. The annotations support the conclusion that the function operates as intended under the assumption of valid input.
