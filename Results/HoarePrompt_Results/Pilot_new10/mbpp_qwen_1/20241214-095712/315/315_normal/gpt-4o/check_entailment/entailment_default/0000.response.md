Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the converted list from `tpl`. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists, which is the correct approach to combine them.

All the provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. The function handles the conversion of the tuple to a list and the concatenation of the two lists correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail based on the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case mentioned.
