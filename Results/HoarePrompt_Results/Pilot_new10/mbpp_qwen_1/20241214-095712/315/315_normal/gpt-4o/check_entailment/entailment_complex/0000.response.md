Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input parameters. It then converts the tuple `tpl` into a list using `list(tpl)` and concatenates it with the original list `lst`. The result is returned as a new list. This process ensures that the elements of the tuple are added to the end of the list, exactly as required by the problem description.

The provided assertions also confirm the functionality:
- `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`
- `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`
- `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`

Since the function correctly adds the tuple to the list in all cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
