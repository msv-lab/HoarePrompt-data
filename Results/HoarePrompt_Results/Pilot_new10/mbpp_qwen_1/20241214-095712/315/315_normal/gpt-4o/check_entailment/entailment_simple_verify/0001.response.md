Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly concatenates the given list `lst` with a list converted from the given tuple `tpl`. The provided test cases also validate that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
