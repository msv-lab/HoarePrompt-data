Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the converted list from `tpl`. The assertions in the problem description and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given examples. Since the code handles the basic requirement correctly and there are no indications of edge cases being missed based on the problem description and output hints, the program is correct.
