Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tpl`, which is a tuple. It then concatenates `lst` with a list converted from `tpl` using the `list()` function and returns the result.

The problem description states that the function should add the given tuple to the given list. The implementation achieves this by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list. This approach ensures that the function will work correctly for any input list and tuple, as demonstrated by the provided test cases.

Thus, the program is correct because it consistently performs the operation as described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
