Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the condition `n % 2 != 0` to determine the parity of a number. However, this condition checks if the number is odd. According to the problem description, we need to check if the parity of a given number is odd. This means we should be checking if the number is even, not odd.

The provided test cases are:
- `func_1(12) == False` (which is correct because 12 is even)
- `func_1(7) == True` (which is incorrect because 7 is odd, but the function returns `False`)
- `func_1(10) == False` (which is correct because 10 is even)

Since the function does not correctly identify that the parity of 7 is odd, the program is incorrect.
