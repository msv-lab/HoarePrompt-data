Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate because the function `func_1` indeed returns the opposite of what the problem description requires. The problem description asks for a function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd, meaning it should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the function `func_1` uses `n % 2 != 0`, which correctly identifies if the number is odd but returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. 

The annotated version confirms this behavior: the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. The provided test cases assert this behavior, which means the function does not meet the requirement to return `True` for even numbers as specified in the problem description. Thus, the original assessment is accurate.
