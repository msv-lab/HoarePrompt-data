Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` uses the condition `n % 2 != 0` which checks if the number is odd. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which implies checking if the number is odd. The provided test cases indicate that the function should return `False` for even numbers and `True` for odd numbers, which aligns with the current implementation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as the function correctly identifies the parity of a number as odd.
