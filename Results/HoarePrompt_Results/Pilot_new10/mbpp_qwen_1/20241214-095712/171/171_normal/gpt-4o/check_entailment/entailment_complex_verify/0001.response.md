Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` checks if the number is odd using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. According to the problem description, we need to determine if the parity of a given number is odd. However, the function actually checks if the number is even. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, which is the opposite of what is required.
