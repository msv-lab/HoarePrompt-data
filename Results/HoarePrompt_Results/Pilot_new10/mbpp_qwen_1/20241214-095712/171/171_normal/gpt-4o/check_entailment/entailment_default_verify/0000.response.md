Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` returns the opposite of what the problem description asks for. The problem description states that the function should determine whether the parity of a given number is odd, meaning it should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the function `func_1` currently uses `n % 2 != 0`, which indeed checks if the number is odd, but it returns `False` for odd numbers and `True` for even numbers. This means the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
