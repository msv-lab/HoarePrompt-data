Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. This is achieved using the modulus operator `%`, where `n % 2 != 0` checks if the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is not zero, indicating that `n` is odd. Conversely, if the remainder is zero, `n` is even, and the function would return `False`. This logic accurately determines the parity of the given number according to the problem description.
