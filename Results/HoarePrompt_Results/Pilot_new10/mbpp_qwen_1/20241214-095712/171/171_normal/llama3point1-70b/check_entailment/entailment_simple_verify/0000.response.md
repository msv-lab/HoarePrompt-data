Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment accurately reflect the functionality of the program. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether the given integer `n` has an odd parity by evaluating `n % 2 != 0`. This condition returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, which aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding whether the parity of a given number is odd. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
