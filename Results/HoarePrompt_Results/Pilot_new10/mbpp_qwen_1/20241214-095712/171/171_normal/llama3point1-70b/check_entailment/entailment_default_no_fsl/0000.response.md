Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd, which is not correct according to the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that determines the parity of a given number (whether it is odd or even). The function should return `True` if the number is even (i.e., its parity is even), and `False` if the number is odd. However, the current implementation uses `n % 2 != 0`, which checks if the number is odd. To fix this, the function should use `n % 2 == 0` to correctly determine if the number is even.
