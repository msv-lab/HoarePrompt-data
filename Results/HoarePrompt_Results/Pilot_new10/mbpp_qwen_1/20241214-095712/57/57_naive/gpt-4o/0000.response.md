Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `sorted` function is applied to each sublist using a list comprehension, which ensures that all elements within each sublist are sorted alphabetically. The assertions provided in the problem description cover various scenarios including sublists with different lengths and sublists containing strings with leading spaces. Since the program handles these cases correctly and there are no apparent edge cases that the program fails to handle based on the provided information, the program is correct.
