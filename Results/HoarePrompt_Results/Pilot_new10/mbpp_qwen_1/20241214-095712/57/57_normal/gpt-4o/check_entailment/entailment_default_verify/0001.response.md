Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists as per the problem description. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the elements within each sublist. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The original assessment correctly states that the function works for various scenarios including different lengths of sublists, spaces in string elements, and different characters. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints.
