Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The use of a list comprehension with the `sorted()` function ensures that each inner list is sorted individually. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, sorting each sublist without altering the overall structure of the input list. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
