Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key for case-insensitive sorting. The annotation clearly describes the state of the program before and after the function call, indicating that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
