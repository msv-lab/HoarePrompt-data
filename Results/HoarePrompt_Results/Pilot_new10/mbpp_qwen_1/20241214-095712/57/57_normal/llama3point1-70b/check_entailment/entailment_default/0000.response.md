Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` to sort the strings in each sublist based on their lowercase versions. This approach ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code meets the requirements for every potential case. The function works correctly for sublists containing any number of strings, including empty sublists and sublists with a single string. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that would cause the code to fail.
