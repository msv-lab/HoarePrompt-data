Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. This logic works for all potential cases where the input is a list of integers. There is no edge case or input that would make this function fail based on the given problem description.
