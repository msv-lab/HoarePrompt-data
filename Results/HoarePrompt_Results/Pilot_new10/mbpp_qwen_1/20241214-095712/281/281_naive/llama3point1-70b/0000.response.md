Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This logic is correct and handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as empty lists, lists with no even numbers, and lists with all even numbers. Therefore, the program works correctly for all described cases.
