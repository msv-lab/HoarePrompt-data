Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` filters out the even numbers from the input list. The provided assertions also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various test cases. Since the code meets the requirements for all given examples and the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
