Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find and return a list of even numbers from a given list of integers. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input (`numbers`).
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
3. If the condition is true, the number is included in the returned list.
4. The assertions provided in the annotated program verify that the function works correctly with different inputs, including edge cases like an empty list or lists containing no even numbers.

Since the function meets the criteria specified in the problem description (finding even numbers from a list of numbers) and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
