Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both indicate that the function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list. The annotations confirm that the function processes a list of integers and returns a list of even numbers, which aligns with the problem description. The provided assertions also validate that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
