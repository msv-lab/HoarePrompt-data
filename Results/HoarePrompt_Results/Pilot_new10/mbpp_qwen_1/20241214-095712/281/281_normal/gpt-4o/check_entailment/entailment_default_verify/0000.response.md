Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find and return even numbers from a given list of integers. The list comprehension filters the even numbers using the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which is appropriate for identifying even numbers. The function passes the provided test cases and aligns with the problem description and output hints. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
