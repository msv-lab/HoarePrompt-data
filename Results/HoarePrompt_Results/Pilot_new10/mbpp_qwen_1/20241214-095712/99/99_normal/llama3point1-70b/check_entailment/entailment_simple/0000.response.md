Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting with the character at index 0 (the first character). This is achieved using a generator expression within the `join` method, where the indices are generated by the `range` function starting from 0 and incrementing by 2 up to but not including the length of the string. This ensures that only characters at even indices are selected and included in the returned string, effectively removing characters at odd indices. Therefore, the program correctly removes characters with odd index values as required.
