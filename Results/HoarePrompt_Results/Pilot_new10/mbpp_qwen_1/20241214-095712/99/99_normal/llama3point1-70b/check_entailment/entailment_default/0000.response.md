Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values. The function iterates over the string, selecting characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and concatenates them into a new string. The output hints confirm that the function returns a string containing every second character from the input string, starting from the first character. There are no potential cases where this code would fail to meet the problem description, as it accurately implements the required functionality for any given string.
