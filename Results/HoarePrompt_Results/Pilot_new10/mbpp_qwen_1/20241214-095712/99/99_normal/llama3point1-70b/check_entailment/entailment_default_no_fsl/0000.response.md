Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s`. It achieves this by using a generator expression within the `join` method, which iterates over even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the string. The output hints confirm that the function returns a string containing every second character from `s`, starting from the first character. Since the function works as intended for all potential cases (it correctly skips characters at odd indices and includes those at even indices), the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
