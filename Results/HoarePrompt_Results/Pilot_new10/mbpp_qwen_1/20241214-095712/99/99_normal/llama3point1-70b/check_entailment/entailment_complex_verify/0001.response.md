Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment accurately reflect the functionality of the provided Python function. The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s` by iterating over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This approach effectively keeps only the characters with even index values, which matches the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a string containing every second character from the original string `s`, starting from the first character. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
