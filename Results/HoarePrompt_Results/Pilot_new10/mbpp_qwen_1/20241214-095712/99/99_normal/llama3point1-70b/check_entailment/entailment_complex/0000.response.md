Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly implements the requirement to remove characters with odd index values from the given string `s`. Here's why:

- The function iterates over the indices of the string `s` using a step of 2 (`range(0, len(s), 2)`), which means it selects characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
- It constructs a new string by joining these selected characters using `''.join()`.
- This results in a string containing every second character from the original string `s`, starting from the first character (index 0).

Since the function meets the problem description exactly and works for all possible input strings, the program is correct.
