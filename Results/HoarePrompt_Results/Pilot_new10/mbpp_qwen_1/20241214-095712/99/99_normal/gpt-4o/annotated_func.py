#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
    #The program returns a string containing characters at even indices of the original string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing characters from `s` at even indices.
