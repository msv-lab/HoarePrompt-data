Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values, keeping only the characters at even indices. The provided test cases (`'abcdef' -> 'ace'`, `'python' -> 'pto'`, `'data' -> 'dt'`, `'lambs' -> 'lms'`) demonstrate that the function behaves as intended. The annotated version further clarifies the purpose and behavior of the function, confirming that it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
