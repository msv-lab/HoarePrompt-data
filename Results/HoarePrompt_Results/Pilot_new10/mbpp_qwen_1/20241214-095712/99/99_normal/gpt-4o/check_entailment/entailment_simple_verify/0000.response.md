Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values, and the provided assertions confirm its correctness. The annotated version correctly describes the state of the program before the function call and what the function returns, aligning with the problem description and the original assessment.
