Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing characters at even indices of the original string. This is evident from the list comprehension `[s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0]`, which iterates over the indices of the string `s` and includes only those characters where the index is even. The use of `''.join(...)` ensures that these characters are concatenated into a single string. 

All provided test cases (`assert func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'`, `assert func_1('python') == 'pto'`, `assert func_1('data') == 'dt'`, `assert func_1('lambs') == 'lms'`) correctly validate this behavior, further confirming that the function meets the problem description for all given cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
