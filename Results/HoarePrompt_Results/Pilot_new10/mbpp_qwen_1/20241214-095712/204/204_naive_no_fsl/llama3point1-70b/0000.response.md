Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a list `months_31_days` containing the numbers of months that have 31 days. If the input `n` is found in this list, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function works correctly for all potential cases of month numbers (1 through 12). Specifically:
- Months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 (which have 31 days) will return `True`.
- Months 4, 6, 9, and 11 (which do not have 31 days) will return `False`.
- Month 2 (February) is not included in the list and will also return `False`, which is correct since February typically has either 28 or 29 days.

Since the function handles all possible inputs correctly according to the problem description, the program is correct.
