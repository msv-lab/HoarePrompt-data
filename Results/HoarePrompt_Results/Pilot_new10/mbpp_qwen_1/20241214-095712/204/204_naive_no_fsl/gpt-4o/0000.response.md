Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 31 days by checking if the given month number is in the set `months_with_31_days`. The assertions provided cover the months January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are indeed the months with 31 days. The function returns `False` for February (2) and June (6), which are correct since these months do not have 31 days. Since the function behaves as expected for all the provided cases and the problem description aligns with the logic implemented, the program is correct.
