Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. It uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number is in this list, otherwise it returns `False`. This approach covers all the potential cases for month numbers containing 31 days, and the function works correctly for all valid month numbers (1 through 12). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
