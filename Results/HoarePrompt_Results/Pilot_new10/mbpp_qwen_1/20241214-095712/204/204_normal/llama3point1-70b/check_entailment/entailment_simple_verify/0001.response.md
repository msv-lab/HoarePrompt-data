Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if the input `n` is in the list of months with 31 days (`[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`), and `False` otherwise. Since the function handles all possible inputs (months 1 through 12) correctly, the program is correct.
