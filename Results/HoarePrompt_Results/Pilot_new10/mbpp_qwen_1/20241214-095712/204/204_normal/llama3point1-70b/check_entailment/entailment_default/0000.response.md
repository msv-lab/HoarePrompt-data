Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` if the month number is in the list of months with 31 days, and `False` otherwise. The output hints confirm this behavior. The function works correctly for all potential cases within the range of 1 to 12, as it accurately identifies the months with 31 days without any missing logic or edge cases.
