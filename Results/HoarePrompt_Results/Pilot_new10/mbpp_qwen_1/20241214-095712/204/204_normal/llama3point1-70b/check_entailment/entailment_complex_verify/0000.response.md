Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. It uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number is in this list, otherwise it returns `False`. Given the problem description and the annotations, the function works as expected for all valid month numbers (1 through 12), thus the original assessment is accurate.
