Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given month number (which is assumed to be between 1 and 12) contains 31 days. The function returns `True` if the month number is in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`, which are the month numbers that contain 31 days, and `False` otherwise. This matches the problem description accurately, and the annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended under the given constraints.
