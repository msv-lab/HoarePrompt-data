Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether a given month number (where 1 represents January and 12 represents December) contains 31 days. The function `func_1` uses a set `months_with_31_days` containing the integers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, which represent the months with 31 days. By checking if the input `month` is in this set, the function returns `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for those without, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs within the range 1 to 12.
