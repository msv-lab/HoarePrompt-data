Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 31 days by checking if the given month number is in the set `months_with_31_days`. The provided assertions cover the months that should have 31 days and those that should not, and the function behaves as expected for all the provided cases. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.
