Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` containing the month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) that have 31 days. The function returns `True` if the input month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. Given the assertions and the output hints, the code accurately implements the requirement for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
