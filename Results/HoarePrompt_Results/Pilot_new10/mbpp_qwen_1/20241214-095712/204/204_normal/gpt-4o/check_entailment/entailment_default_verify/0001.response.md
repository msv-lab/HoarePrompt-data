Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by comparing it against a predefined set of months that have 31 days. The assertions in the code cover all the relevant cases, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended for valid inputs within the range of 1 to 12. The function does not need to handle invalid inputs as per the assumption, and it correctly returns `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for those without, aligning with the problem description.
