Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days by returning `True` for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and `False` for others. The provided test cases cover all relevant months, and the logic within the function is sound. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
