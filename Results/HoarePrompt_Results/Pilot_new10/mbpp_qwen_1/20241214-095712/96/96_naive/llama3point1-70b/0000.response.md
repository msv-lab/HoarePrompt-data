Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It uses a set to store the unique types of elements in the tuple and checks if the size of this set is 1. This approach is correct because:

- It iterates through each element in the tuple once, determining its type using `type(x)`.
- It stores these types in a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
- If the set contains only one type, it means all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

This logic covers all potential cases where the tuple might contain elements of different or the same data types. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where this program would fail based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
