Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function starts by checking if the tuple is empty using `if (not tup)`. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially satisfies the condition of having elements of the same data type (there are no elements to differ).

2. **Type Checking Logic**: For non-empty tuples, the function determines the type of the first element using `first_type = type(tup[0])`. It then iterates over each element in the tuple. If any element's type differs from `first_type`, it immediately returns `False`.

3. **Consistency Check**: After the loop completes without finding any differing types, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

Given these points, the function accurately implements the logic required to verify if all elements in a tuple share the same data type. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
