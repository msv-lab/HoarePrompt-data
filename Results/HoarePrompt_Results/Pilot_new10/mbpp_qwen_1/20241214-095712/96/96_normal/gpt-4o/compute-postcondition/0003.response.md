The code `first_type = type(tup[0])` assigns the type of the first element in the tuple `tup` to the variable `first_type`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements of any type, and `tup` is not an empty tuple; `first_type` is the type of the first element in `tup`**
