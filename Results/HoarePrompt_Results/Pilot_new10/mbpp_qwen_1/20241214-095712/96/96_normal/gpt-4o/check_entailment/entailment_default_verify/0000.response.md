Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` for an empty tuple or if all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element, and returns `False` otherwise. The function behaves as expected based on the problem description and the test cases provided. There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that suggest the function is incorrect.
