Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function works as follows:
1. It first checks if the tuple is empty. If it is, it returns `True` since an empty tuple trivially has elements of the same type.
2. It determines the type of the first element in the tuple.
3. It iterates through each element in the tuple and checks if its type matches the type of the first element.
4. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`.
5. If all elements have the same type, it returns `True`.

The assertions provided in the output hints confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases:
- `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True`: All elements are integers.
- `func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False`: The first two elements are integers, and the third is a string.
- `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True`: All elements are integers.

Since the function handles both the empty tuple case and the case where all elements are of the same type correctly, and there are no apparent edge cases missed, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
