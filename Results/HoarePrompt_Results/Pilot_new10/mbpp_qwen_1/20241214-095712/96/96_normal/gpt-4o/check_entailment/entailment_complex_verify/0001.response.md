Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions confirm that the function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The function handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct. It also iterates through the tuple and compares the type of each element with the type of the first element, returning `False` as soon as it finds a differing type, and `True` if all types match. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes these tests. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
