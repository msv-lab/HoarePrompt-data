Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set comprehension to collect the types of elements in the tuple `tup`. Since a set only contains unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same type, the length of the resulting set will be 1. This approach correctly identifies whether all elements in the tuple share the same data type for any given input tuple. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
