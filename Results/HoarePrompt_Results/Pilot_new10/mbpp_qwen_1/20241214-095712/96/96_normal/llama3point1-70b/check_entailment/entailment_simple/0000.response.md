Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as an input.
- It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to iterate through each element `x` in the tuple and get its type.
- The `set` function is then used to collect these types into a set, which will only contain unique values.
- Finally, the length of this set is checked against `1`. If the length is `1`, it means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This logic ensures that the function correctly identifies whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description for all possible cases.
