Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the functionality of the provided `func_1`. The program correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by converting each element's type to a set and verifying if the set contains exactly one unique type. This approach is consistent with the problem description and the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
