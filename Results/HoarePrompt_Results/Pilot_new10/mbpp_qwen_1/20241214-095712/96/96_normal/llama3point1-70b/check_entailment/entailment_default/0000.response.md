Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type. It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to iterate over each element in the tuple and obtain its type. The `set()` function is then used to create a set of these types. If all elements are of the same type, the set will contain only one unique type, and the length of the set will be 1. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements have the same type and `False` otherwise. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should return `True` if all elements in the tuple have the same data type and `False` otherwise. The code works correctly for all potential cases, and the output hints confirm this behavior.
