Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The logic within the `while` loop correctly narrows down the search range based on whether the middle element is equal to, less than, or greater than the target value. When the target value is found, the program updates the `result` to the current index and continues to search in the lower half of the array to ensure it finds the first occurrence. This approach handles the requirement accurately for the provided test cases and, in general, for any sorted array where the target number exists. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description and the given examples.
