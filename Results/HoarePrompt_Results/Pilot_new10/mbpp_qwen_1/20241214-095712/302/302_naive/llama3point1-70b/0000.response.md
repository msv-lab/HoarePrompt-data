Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Since the array is sorted, once the number is found, the loop will stop immediately, which ensures that the first occurrence is returned. If the number is not present in the array, `-1` is returned as expected. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would make this program incorrect based on the given problem description.
