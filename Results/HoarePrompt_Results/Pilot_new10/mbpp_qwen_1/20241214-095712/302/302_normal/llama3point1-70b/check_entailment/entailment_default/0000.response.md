Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a simple linear search to find the first occurrence of the given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value of each element. When it finds the first occurrence of the target number (`num`), it immediately returns the index. If the loop completes without finding the target number, it returns `-1`.

Given the problem description, the function should return the index of the first occurrence of the given number in a sorted array, or `-1` if the number is not found. The code satisfies this requirement for every potential case:

- It correctly handles the case where the target number is found at the beginning of the array.
- It correctly handles the case where the target number is found somewhere in the middle of the array.
- It correctly handles the case where the target number is not found in the array, returning `-1`.

Since the code meets the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
