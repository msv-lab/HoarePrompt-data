Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of integers (sorted in non-decreasing order) and an integer, and returns the appropriate index or `-1`. The function iterates through the array and returns the index as soon as it finds the first occurrence of the given number, which aligns with the problem description. The function handles all potential cases by returning `-1` if the number is not found in the array.
