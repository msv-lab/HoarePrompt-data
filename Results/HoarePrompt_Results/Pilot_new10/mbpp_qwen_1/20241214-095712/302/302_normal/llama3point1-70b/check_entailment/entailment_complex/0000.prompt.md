You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, and `i` is either the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` or `len(arr)`, and `x` is the element in `arr` at index `i` (if `i < len(arr)`), and the function returns `i` if `x == num`, otherwise it returns `None`.
    return -1
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` (sorted in non-decreasing order) and an integer `num`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` or `-1` if `num` is not found.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
