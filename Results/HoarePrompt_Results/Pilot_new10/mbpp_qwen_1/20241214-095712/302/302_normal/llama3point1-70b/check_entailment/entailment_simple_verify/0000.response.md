Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The loop stops as soon as the number is found, ensuring that the first occurrence is returned. If the number is not present, `-1` is returned as expected. The original assessment is accurate because the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
