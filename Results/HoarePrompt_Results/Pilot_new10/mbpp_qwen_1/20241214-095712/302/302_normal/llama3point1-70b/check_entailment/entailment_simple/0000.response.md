Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It aims to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (`num`) in a sorted array (`arr`). 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function iterates through each element of the array using a `for` loop combined with `enumerate` to get both the index (`i`) and the value (`x`) of each element. If the current element (`x`) matches the target number (`num`), it immediately returns the index (`i`).

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the target number is found during the iteration, the function will return the index of its first occurrence.
   - If the target number is not found in the array, the function will iterate through the entire array and return `-1` once the loop completes.

3. **Sorted Array**: Since the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, the first occurrence of the target number will be the earliest possible position where the number can appear, which aligns with the requirement to find the first occurrence.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `-1` if the number is not found, which is a valid indication that the target number does not exist in the array.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the specified functionality for any input array and target number, making it correct according to the problem description.
