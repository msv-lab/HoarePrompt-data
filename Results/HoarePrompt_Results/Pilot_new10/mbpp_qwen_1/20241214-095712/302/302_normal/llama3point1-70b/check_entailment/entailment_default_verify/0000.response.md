Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the number or `-1` if the number is not found. Since the array is sorted, the program will indeed return the correct index or `-1` as expected. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or output hints that would indicate the program is incorrect.
