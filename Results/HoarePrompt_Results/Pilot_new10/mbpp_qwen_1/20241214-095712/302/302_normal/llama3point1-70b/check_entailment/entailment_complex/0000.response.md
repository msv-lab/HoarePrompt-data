Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through the sorted array `arr` using a for loop and the `enumerate` function, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element in `arr`. When it finds the first occurrence of the target number `num`, it immediately returns the index `i`. If the loop completes without finding `num`, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` if it exists, or `-1` if `num` is not present in `arr`.

The provided annotations accurately describe the state of the program at each stage, confirming that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
