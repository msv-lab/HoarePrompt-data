Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the array `arr` using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the current element matches the given number `num`, it immediately returns the index. If no match is found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function finds the index of the first occurrence of the number, which aligns with the problem description. The function handles all potential cases correctly, including when the number is not present in the array.
