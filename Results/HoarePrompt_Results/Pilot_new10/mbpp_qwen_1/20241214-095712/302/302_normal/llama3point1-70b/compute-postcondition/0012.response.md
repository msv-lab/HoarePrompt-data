The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num`, which is an integer. The function returns one of the following based on the conditions:
- Case_1: Returns 0
- Case_2: Returns 1
- Case_3: Returns 2
- Case_4: Returns None

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` (sorted in non-decreasing order) and an integer `num`, and return 0, 1, 2, or None based on specific conditions.
