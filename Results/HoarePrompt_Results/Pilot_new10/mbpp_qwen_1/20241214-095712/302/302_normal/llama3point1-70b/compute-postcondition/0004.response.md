Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element.
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `x` is not equal to `num`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using `enumerate`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `arr`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration:
     - `i` is 0.
     - `x` is the first element of `arr`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` will be the second element of `arr`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - `x` will be the second element of `arr`.

Given these points, we need to update the states accordingly.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `num` is an integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`**
