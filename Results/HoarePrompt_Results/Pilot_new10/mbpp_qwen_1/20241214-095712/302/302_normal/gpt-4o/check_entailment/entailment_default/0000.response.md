Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code performs a binary search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the code does not ensure that the target is found before returning. Specifically, the loop terminates when `low > high`, meaning it may terminate without finding the target if the target is not present in the array. This can lead to the function returning -1 even though the target is present but not found.

For example, consider the following input:
```python
func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6)
```
In this case, the loop will terminate after the first iteration because `low` becomes 1 and `high` becomes 0, even though the target 6 is present in the array. Therefore, the function will return -1, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the loop should continue until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that all possible indices are checked. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1  # Continue searching in the left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

This version ensures that the loop continues to search in the left half after finding the target, making sure that the first occurrence of the target is found.
