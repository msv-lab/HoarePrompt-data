Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function correctly implements a binary search to find the first occurrence of the target in a sorted array. The original assessment stated that the program is correct, and this is supported by the annotations, which show that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct index if the target is found and -1 otherwise. The annotations and the code itself confirm that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
