The code updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` was previously calculated as `(low + high) // 2` and `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, the value of `low` is now `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.
- `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `result` is `-1`.
- `mid` is updated to `low + (high - low) // 2` which is `mid + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is `low + (high - low) // 2`**.
