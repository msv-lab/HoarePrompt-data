Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program is correct. However, upon reviewing the code and the annotations, it is clear that the program does not always return the correct index of the first occurrence of the target value. Specifically, the program updates `result` to `mid` when it finds the target, but it then immediately narrows the search range to the left half (`high = mid - 1`). This means that if there are multiple occurrences of the target value, the program will return the index of the first occurrence only if it happens to be the last element checked before narrowing the search range. For example, consider the array `[5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` and the target `5`. The program will return `1` because it finds the first `5` and then searches in the right half, but the first occurrence is actually at index `0`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of finding the index of the first occurrence of the given number in a sorted array.
