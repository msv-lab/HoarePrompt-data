The variable `high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. This means the previous value of `high` (which was at least `mid`) is now decreased by 1. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `result`, `low`, and `mid`) are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is `mid`, `low` is unchanged, `high` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
