Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `target` is an integer.
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `result` is -1 (indicating that the target has not been found yet).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to determine the adjustments required so that the loop can execute at least once.

4. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `low <= high` must be true.
   - Initially, `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `len(arr) - 1`. Therefore, `low <= high` will always be true since `low` starts at 0 and `high` starts at `len(arr) - 1`.

Given this analysis, there is no need to adjust any state because the loop condition is already satisfied with the initial values of `low` and `high`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1**
