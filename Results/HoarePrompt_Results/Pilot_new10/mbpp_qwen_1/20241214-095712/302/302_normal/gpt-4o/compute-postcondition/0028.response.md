Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1. If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. After the if-else block executes, `result` is still the index of `target` if found, otherwise it remains -1.***
