Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1. If `arr[mid] == target`, then `result` is set to `mid`, `low` remains unchanged, and `high` is set to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid] < target`, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, and `high` remains unchanged. If `arr[mid] > target`, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, and `low` remains unchanged. After the if-else block executes, `result` is still the index of `target` if found, otherwise it remains -1.***
