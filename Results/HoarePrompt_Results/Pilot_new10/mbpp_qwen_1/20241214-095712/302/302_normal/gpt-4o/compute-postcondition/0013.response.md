Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, if `arr[mid] == target`, then `result` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` and `high` are updated to search either the upper or lower half of the array depending on whether `arr[mid] < target` or not, respectively. `result` remains -1, and `mid` is recalculated based on the new `low` and `high` values.**
