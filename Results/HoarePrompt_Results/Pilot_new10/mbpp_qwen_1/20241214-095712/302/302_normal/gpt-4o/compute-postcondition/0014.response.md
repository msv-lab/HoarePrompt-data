Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `target` is an integer.
   - If `arr[mid] == target`, then `result` is set to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low` and `high` are updated to search either the upper or lower half of the array depending on whether `arr[mid] < target` or not, respectively.
   - `result` remains -1, indicating the target has not been found yet.
   - `mid` is recalculated based on the new `low` and `high` values.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must still be true.
   - This means that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - We need to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high` for the loop to continue.
   - Since the problem specifies that the loop updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `target`, we don't need to adjust any other states directly related to the loop condition.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is -1, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.**
