The code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range defined by `low` and `high`. The value of `mid` is updated based on the current values of `low` and `high`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is -1, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2**
