The code assigns the value of `mid` to `result`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and none of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `result`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is `mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
