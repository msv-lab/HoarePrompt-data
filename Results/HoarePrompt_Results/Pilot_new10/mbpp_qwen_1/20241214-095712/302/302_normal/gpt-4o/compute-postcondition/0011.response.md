The code `high = mid - 1` changes the value of the variable `high`. The previous value of `mid` was \((\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2\), and since `low` is 0 and `high` was previously set to `len(arr) - 1`, the value of `mid` is \(\frac{0 + (\text{len(arr)} - 1)}{2}\). After executing `high = mid - 1`, the new value of `high` is \(\left(\frac{0 + (\text{len(arr)} - 1)}{2}\right) - 1\).

The states of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `low`, `result`, `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is \(\left(\frac{\text{len(arr)} - 1}{2}\right) - 1\), `result` is -1, `mid` is \(\frac{\text{len(arr)} - 1}{2}\)**
