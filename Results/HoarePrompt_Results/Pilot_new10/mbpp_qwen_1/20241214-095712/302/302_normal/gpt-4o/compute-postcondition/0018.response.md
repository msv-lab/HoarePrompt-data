The variable `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, so `low` is now `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is -1, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `low` is (low + high) // 2 + 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is -1, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `low` is (low + high) // 2 + 1**
