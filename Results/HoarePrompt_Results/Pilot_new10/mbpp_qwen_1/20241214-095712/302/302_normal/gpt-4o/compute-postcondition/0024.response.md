The code assigns the value of `mid` to `result`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is `mid`, `low` and `high` are such that `low <= high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
