Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The built-in `count` method of strings in Python accurately performs this task for all possible inputs, including edge cases such as empty strings or strings without the substring 'std'. Since the function works as expected for all potential cases, the program is correct.
