Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string using the built-in `count` method. All the provided test cases are handled correctly:

- `func_1('letstdlenstdporstd')` returns `3`, which is correct.
- `func_1('truststdsolensporsd')` returns `1`, which is correct.
- `func_1('makestdsostdworthit')` returns `2`, which is correct.
- `func_1('stds')` returns `1`, which is correct.
- `func_1('')` returns `0`, which is correct.

Since the function works as expected for all the provided test cases and the `count` method handles overlapping substrings correctly, there are no potential cases identified where the program does not meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
