Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The `count` method of a string in Python accurately handles overlapping occurrences as well. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
