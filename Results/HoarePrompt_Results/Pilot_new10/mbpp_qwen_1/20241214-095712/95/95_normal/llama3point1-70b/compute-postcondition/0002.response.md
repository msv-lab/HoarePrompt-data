The annotated code indicates that the function `func_1` takes a string `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`. The return statement directly provides this functionality without any additional conditions or logic that might alter the basic operation.

Given that the code and the annotations align, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and returns the number of times the substring 'std' appears in `s`.**
