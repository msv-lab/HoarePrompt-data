Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in `count` method. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a string and returning the count of 'std' occurrences. Since the problem description asks for counting the occurrences of the substring 'std', and the function performs this task accurately, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
