Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. The assertions provided cover various cases, including strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', strings with a single occurrence of 'std', and an empty string. The function works correctly for all these cases, and since the problem description only requires counting the occurrences of 'std' without any additional conditions or edge cases mentioned, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases described.
