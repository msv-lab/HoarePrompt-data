Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string using the built-in `count` method. The output hints clearly state that the function accepts a string and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std', which matches the problem description. All the provided test cases work as expected, and there are no apparent edge cases that the function fails to handle based on the problem description and the output hints.
