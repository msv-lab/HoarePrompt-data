Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. The assertions provided in the annotations test various cases, including strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', strings with a single occurrence, and an empty string, all of which the function handles correctly using the built-in `count` method of strings in Python. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
