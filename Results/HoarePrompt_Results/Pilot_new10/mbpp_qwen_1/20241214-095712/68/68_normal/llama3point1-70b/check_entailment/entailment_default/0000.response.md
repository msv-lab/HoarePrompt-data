Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as inputs, creates a complex number from these parts using the `complex()` function, and then calculates and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The code handles all potential cases since the `cmath.phase()` function can handle any valid complex number, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, and the implementation does not contain any logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
