Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The function takes two floating-point numbers as input, creates a complex number from them, and returns the phase angle (in radians). This matches the problem description perfectly, and there are no issues or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that would invalidate the original assessment.
