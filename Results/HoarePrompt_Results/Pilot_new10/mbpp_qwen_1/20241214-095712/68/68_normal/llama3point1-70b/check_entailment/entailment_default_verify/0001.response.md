Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function accepts two floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase angle in radians. Since the problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number, and the function fulfills this requirement without any apparent issues or edge cases, the original assessment is correct.
