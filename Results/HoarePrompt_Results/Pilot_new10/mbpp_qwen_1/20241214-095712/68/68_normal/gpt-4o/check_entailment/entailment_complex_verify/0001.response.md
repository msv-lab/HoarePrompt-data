Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using `cmath.phase`. The provided assertions test different scenarios, including purely imaginary numbers and a complex number with both real and imaginary parts, and the function returns the expected results within the specified tolerance. Since the function handles these cases accurately and there are no logical errors or edge cases identified in the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate.
