Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at different points, indicating that the function takes real and imaginary parts as inputs and returns the phase angle of the corresponding complex number. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
