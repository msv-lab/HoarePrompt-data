Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are integers or floating-point numbers, and returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.** 

This summary accurately reflects the functionality of the function based on the code provided. The function creates a complex number using the `complex(real, imag)` constructor and then returns the phase angle of this complex number using `cmath.phase()`. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the given code that would require additional information in the summary.
