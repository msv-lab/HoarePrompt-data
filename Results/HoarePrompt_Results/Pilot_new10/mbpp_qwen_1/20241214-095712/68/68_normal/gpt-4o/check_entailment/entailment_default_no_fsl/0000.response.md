Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, and returns the phase angle of the complex number formed by these real and imaginary parts. The function uses `cmath.phase` to compute the phase angle, which is the correct approach for getting the angle of a complex number.

The assertions in the code test the function with different inputs and check if the returned values are close to the expected angles using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001. The provided test cases cover both positive and zero real and imaginary parts, and the function passes these tests, indicating that it works correctly for the given examples.

Since the function uses the correct method (`cmath.phase`) and the provided test cases cover various scenarios without any issues, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for the given cases. Therefore, the correctness is True.
