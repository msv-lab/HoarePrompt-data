Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using `cmath.phase`. The test cases given in the assertions cover the following scenarios:
1. A purely imaginary number with positive imaginary part.
2. A complex number with both real and imaginary parts.
3. A purely imaginary number with negative imaginary part.

Since the function uses `cmath.phase`, which returns the phase angle of the complex number in radians, and the assertions match expected values within a relative tolerance, the function appears to handle these cases correctly. There do not appear to be any obvious edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail based on the problem description and the given test cases.
