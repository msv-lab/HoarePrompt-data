Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` module. The function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number from these parts and returns its phase.

Given the problem description to write a function to get the angle of a complex number, this function meets the requirement. There is no edge case or specific input scenario provided in the problem description that this function would fail to handle correctly. Therefore, the function is correct for all standard inputs.
