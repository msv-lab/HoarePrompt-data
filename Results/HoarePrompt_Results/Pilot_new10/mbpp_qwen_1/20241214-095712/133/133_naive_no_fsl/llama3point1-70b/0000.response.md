Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `tup2` from `tup1`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. Since the function uses `zip` to pair elements from both tuples and a generator expression to perform the subtraction, it will work correctly as long as both input tuples have the same length. There are no edge cases or special conditions that this function fails to handle, as it will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths, which is the expected behavior for tuple operations in Python. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
