Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The code uses a generator expression within a tuple comprehension to perform the subtraction for each pair of elements. The assertions provided in the code also validate the implementation for various test cases. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that suggest the code is incorrect. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case.
