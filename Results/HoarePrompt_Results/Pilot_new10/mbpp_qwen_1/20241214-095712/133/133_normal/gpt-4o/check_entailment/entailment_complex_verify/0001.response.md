Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment accurately reflect the functionality and correctness of the `func_1` function. The function correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The provided assertions pass, and the annotations correctly describe the operations performed within the function. There are no potential edge cases or errors mentioned in the annotations that would invalidate the correctness of the function under the given problem description.
