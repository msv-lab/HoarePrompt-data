Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are assumed to be of the same length, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This is exactly what the problem description states. The implementation uses a generator expression within a tuple comprehension to perform the subtraction, ensuring that each element of the resulting tuple is computed as required. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works correctly for the given examples, further validating its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
