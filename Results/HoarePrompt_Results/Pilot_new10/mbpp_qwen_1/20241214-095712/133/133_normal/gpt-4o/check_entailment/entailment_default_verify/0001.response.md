Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple()` constructor to perform the subtraction element-wise, ensuring that the operation is applied to each pair of elements from the two input tuples. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of the same length as expected, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail. The assertions provided also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
