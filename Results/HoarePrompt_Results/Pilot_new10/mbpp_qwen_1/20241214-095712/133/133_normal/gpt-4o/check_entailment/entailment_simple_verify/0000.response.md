Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions confirm that the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. The function subtracts the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple and returns a tuple with the results. All provided assertions pass, and the annotations accurately describe the state and operations within the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
