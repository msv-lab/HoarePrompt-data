Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description and the provided assertions. The annotated version of the code accurately describes the functionality of the function, confirming that it performs the required operation of subtracting corresponding elements of the two input tuples. Since the code handles tuples of the same length and no edge cases or incorrect behaviors were identified, the original assessment remains accurate.
