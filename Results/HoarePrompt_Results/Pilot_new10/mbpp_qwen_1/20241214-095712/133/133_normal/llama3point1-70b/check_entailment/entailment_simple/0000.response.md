Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) as input parameters.
2. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples simultaneously, where each pair consists of one element from `tup1` and one element from `tup2` at the same index.
3. For each pair `(a, b)` obtained from `zip(tup1, tup2)`, it performs the subtraction `a - b`.
4. The result of this subtraction is collected into a new tuple using a generator expression inside the `tuple()` function, which returns a tuple of the results.

This process ensures that each element of `tup1` is subtracted by the corresponding element of `tup2`, exactly as specified in the problem description. Since the operation is performed element-wise and the input tuples are of the same length (as required by `zip`), the function will work correctly for any valid input tuples.
