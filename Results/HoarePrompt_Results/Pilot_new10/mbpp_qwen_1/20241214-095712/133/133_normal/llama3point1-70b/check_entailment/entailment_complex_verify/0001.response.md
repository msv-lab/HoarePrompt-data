Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function operates as intended, performing element-wise subtraction given that both input tuples are of the same length. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles the core requirement correctly and raises a `ValueError` if the inputs do not meet the necessary conditions, which aligns with the problem description and expected behavior.
