Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input, which are expected to be of the same length. It then uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple. This new tuple contains the results of subtracting the corresponding elements of `tup2` from `tup1`. The resulting tuple is returned by the function.

Since the implementation directly performs the subtraction operation as described and handles tuples of the same length, the function correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for any valid input tuples. Therefore, the program is correct.
