Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement, which is to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses `zip` to ensure that elements are paired correctly and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. The output hints also confirm that the function works as expected for tuples of the same length. While the original assessment did not mention handling tuples of different lengths explicitly, it is reasonable to infer that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths, which is the expected behavior in Python. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all potential valid cases described in the problem statement and the output hints.
