Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly sort the list. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the approach used to sort the list is not a standard sorting algorithm and may not produce the correct sorted order for certain inputs. For example, consider the input list `[3, 1, 2]`:

1. Initially, `size = 3`.
2. The maximum element is `3` at index `0`. The list is partially reversed to place `3` at the end: `[3, 2, 1]`.
3. Then `size = 2`.
4. The maximum element is `2` at index `1`. The list is partially reversed again: `[3, 1, 2]`.

The final state of the list is not sorted. A correct sorting algorithm would rearrange the elements so that the list is in ascending order. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to sort the list correctly.
