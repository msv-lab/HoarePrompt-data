Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly sort the list as intended. Let's consider a specific case: `arr = [3, 2, 1]`.

1. In the first iteration (`size = 3`), the maximum element is 3, which is at index 0. The condition `max_index != size - 1` is false, so no reversing happens.
2. In the second iteration (`size = 2`), the maximum element is 2, which is at index 1. The condition `max_index != size - 1` is true, but `max_index != 0` is also true. This leads to two reversals:
   - `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses `[2]`, resulting in `[2]`.
   - `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses `[2, 1]`, resulting in `[1, 2]`.

After these operations, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted, but the intention was to use a sorting algorithm like selection sort, where the largest element is moved to its correct position in each pass. The provided code does not achieve this consistently for all cases. For instance, consider `arr = [2, 1, 3]`. Following the same logic:

1. In the first iteration (`size = 3`), the maximum element is 3, which is at index 2. The condition `max_index != size - 1` is true, and since `max_index != 0` is also true, two reversals happen:
   - `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses `[2, 1]`, resulting in `[1, 2]`.
   - `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in `[3, 2, 1]`.

This shows that the program does not always sort the list correctly, hence it is incorrect.
