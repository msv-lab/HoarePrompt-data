Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort the array using a custom method, but it does not appear to implement a standard sorting algorithm. Instead, it seems to be using a series of `find_max_index` calls followed by `flip` operations. However, this approach does not guarantee a fully sorted array.

To verify this, consider the following test case:

```python
assert func_1([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this case, the function should sort the array `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. However, the provided implementation does not correctly sort the array. Specifically, the `find_max_index` function only finds the maximum element's index within the current size of the array segment, and swapping the last element with the found maximum element and the first element with the last element does not ensure a correctly sorted array.

Therefore, the program does not correctly sort the list for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
