Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements. If `max_index` is not 0, then the subarray `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`, and `max_index` is not equal to the size of `arr` minus one. If `max_index` is 0, no changes are made to the array and the same conditions hold true.***
