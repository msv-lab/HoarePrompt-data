Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `arr` is a list of elements with the subarray `arr[:size]` reversed.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `max_index` is the index of the new maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `size` starting from `n` down to 1. This means that `size` decreases by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the loop affects the states given the loop condition.

4. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of elements with the subarray `arr[:size]` reversed.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `max_index` is the index of the new maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`.
   - If `new_max_index` is not equal to `n-1`, the new maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr` remains unchanged from its original position.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop decrements `size` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `size` will be `n-1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The list `arr` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop does not modify `arr` directly within its body.
   - The variable `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `max_index` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless the new maximum element's position changes due to the reversal of the subarray `arr[:size]`.

Given that the loop only changes `size` and does not modify `arr`, `n`, or `max_index` directly, the states remain the same for the next iteration except for the value of `size` which decreases by 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` is a list of elements with the subarray `arr[:n-1]` reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `max_index` is the index of the new maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
