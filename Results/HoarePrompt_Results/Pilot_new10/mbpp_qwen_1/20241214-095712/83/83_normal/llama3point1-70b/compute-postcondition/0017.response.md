Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a list with the subarray `arr[:n-1]` reversed.
   - `max_index` is 0 if it was 0 initially, otherwise `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[:size]`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the subarray `arr[:max_index + 1]`.
   - This means the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are now reversed.

3. **Impact**:
   - Since the subarray `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, the values of these elements change, but the rest of the array remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

4. **Output State**:
   - `arr` is updated such that the first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed.
   - `max_index` retains its value from the initial state because the reversal operation only affects the first `max_index + 1` elements and does not change the value of `max_index`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list with the subarray `arr[:n-1]` reversed and the first `max_index + 1` elements reversed, `max_index` is 0 if it was 0 initially, otherwise `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[:size]`.**
