Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code attempts to sort the list in descending order, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the approach of reversing parts of the array to move the maximum element to the end of the current subarray may not always result in a correctly sorted list. 

For example, consider the input list `[3, 2, 4, 1]`. The code will first set `size` to 4, find the maximum element (4) at index 2, and reverse the prefix up to index 2 (`[3, 2]` becomes `[2, 3]`). Then it reverses the entire subarray of size 4, resulting in `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. However, this does not ensure that the list is sorted in descending order. 

A more robust approach would be to implement a proper sorting algorithm like bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort that guarantees a correctly sorted list. The current implementation may fail to sort the list correctly for certain inputs due to the nature of the reversal operations.
