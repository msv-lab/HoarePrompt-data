The code `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[:size]` and assigns it to `max_index`. 

In the initial state, `arr[:n-1]` is reversed, meaning the first `n-1` elements of `arr` are in reverse order. The value of `max_index` depends on whether it was already 0 or not.

Let's consider two cases:

1. If `max_index` was 0, the state remains unchanged, so `max_index` is still 0.
2. If `max_index` was not 0, then `arr[max_index]` was the maximum element among the first `n` elements of `arr`. After executing the code, `max_index` will now be the actual index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `arr` and `size`, we'll represent the output state based on these considerations.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with the subarray `arr[:n-1]` reversed, `max_index` is 0 if it was 0 initially, otherwise `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[:size]`.**
