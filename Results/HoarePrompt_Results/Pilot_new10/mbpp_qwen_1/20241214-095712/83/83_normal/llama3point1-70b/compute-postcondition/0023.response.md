The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of elements (which can be of any type that supports comparison). After executing the function body, the function returns the sorted list `arr` in its original descending order.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the list sorted in descending order.
