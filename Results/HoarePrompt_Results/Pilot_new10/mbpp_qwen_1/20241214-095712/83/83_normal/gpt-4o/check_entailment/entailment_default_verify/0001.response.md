Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the provided implementation does not guarantee a fully sorted array. The `func_1` function uses a custom swapping mechanism where it finds the maximum element in the current segment of the array, swaps it with the last element, and then swaps the first element with the last element. This approach does not ensure a correctly sorted array for all cases. For example, the provided test case `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` would not be sorted correctly by this method. The output hints also confirm that the function reduces the array size and does not guarantee a fully sorted array, supporting the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
