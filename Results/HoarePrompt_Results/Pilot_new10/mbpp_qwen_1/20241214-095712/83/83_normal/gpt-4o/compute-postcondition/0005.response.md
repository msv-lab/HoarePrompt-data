Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len}(arr)\).
   - `max_index` is 1 if the element at index `i` (which is 1) in `arr` is greater than the element at `max_index` (which is 0). Otherwise, `max_index` remains 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `max_index` will depend on the comparison between `arr[1]` and `arr[max_index]` during the previous iteration.

5. **Determining `max_index`:**
   - If `arr[1]` was greater than `arr[max_index]` (which is 0), then `max_index` would be 1.
   - If `arr[1]` was not greater than `arr[max_index]`, then `max_index` would remain 0.
   - Since we don't know the exact values of `arr[1]` and `arr[0]`, we will keep `max_index` as it is unless additional information is provided.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `max_index` will remain the same as the previous state unless further information is provided.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n \(\leq\) len(arr), `max_index` is 1 if the element at index 1 in `arr` is greater than the element at `max_index` (which is 0). Otherwise, `max_index` remains 0, and `i` is 2.**
