You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements (can be of any comparable type).
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `curr_size` is 1, `max_index` is not defined (or can be any value since it's out of scope), `n` is the original length of `arr` and is now less than 2.
    return arr
    #`The program returns the sorted list 'arr' with its current size being 1`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `arr` is a list of elements, and `end` is an integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr).
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements where the elements at indices `start` and `end` are swapped, `start` is equal to `end + 1`, `end` is equal to `-1`, and `start` must have been less than `end` initially.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of comparable elements, and n is an integer such that 0 < n <= len(arr).
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n â‰¤ len(arr), and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[0:n]`.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[0:n]`


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
