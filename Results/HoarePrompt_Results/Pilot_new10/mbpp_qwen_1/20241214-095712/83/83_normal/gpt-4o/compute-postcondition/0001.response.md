State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= len(arr), `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The for loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `1` because the loop starts at `1`.
3. The initial value of `i` is set to `1` by the range function (`range(1, n)`).
4. The variable `max_index` is initially set to `0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is `1`, and `n` must be greater than `1` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables remain as provided.
