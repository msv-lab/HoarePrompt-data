Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an integer `n`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[0:n]`. This is achieved by iterating through the subarray from index 1 to `n-1` and updating the index of the maximum element whenever a larger element is found.**
