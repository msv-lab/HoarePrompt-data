Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly sort the list as intended. The `func_1` function attempts to sort the array by repeatedly finding the maximum element and swapping it to the end of the current subarray, which is a partial sorting process but not a full sort. This method does not ensure that the entire array is sorted, especially for cases where the maximum element is already in the correct position within the current subarray. The annotated version confirms that the `func_1` function only ensures that the maximum element is moved to the end of the current subarray, and this process is repeated until the subarray size is reduced to 1. This does not guarantee a fully sorted array, thus the original assessment of the program's correctness being false is accurate.
