Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement a standard sorting algorithm as required by the problem description. Instead, it appears to use a bubble-like approach to sort the array, but it is not correctly implemented to ensure the array is fully sorted. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Sorting Mechanism**: The function `func_1` iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, finding the maximum element in the remaining unsorted part of the array and swapping it to the end. However, this mechanism does not guarantee a full sort because it only ensures that the largest element of the unsorted portion moves to the end in each iteration. It does not ensure that the second-largest element will be placed in the correct position relative to the already sorted part.

2. **Lack of Multiple Passes**: A complete sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort would need multiple passes to ensure all elements are correctly placed. However, the provided code performs a single pass through the array and does not repeat the process enough times to fully sort the array.

3. **Testing Cases**: The provided test cases assume the array is partially sorted or already sorted, which does not validate the general correctness of the sorting algorithm. For example:
   ```python
   assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
   ```
   In this case, if the array were `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]`, it might already be partially sorted, but it is not guaranteed to be fully sorted by the provided algorithm. Similarly, other test cases also do not cover the full range of possible inputs that a proper sorting algorithm should handle.

4. **General Case**: Consider a general case like `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]`. The provided algorithm will not correctly sort this array because it only places the largest unsorted element at the end in each iteration, which is insufficient for a complete sort.

To meet the problem description, the function should ensure that the array is fully sorted after the function call, which requires more than one pass over the array and proper placement of all elements in their correct positions.
