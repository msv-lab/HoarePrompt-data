Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly sort the list in non-decreasing order for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` uses a mechanism that involves finding the maximum element in the current subarray, flipping it to the end, and then flipping the entire subarray to sort it. However, this approach does not guarantee a fully sorted list. The function `find_max_index` finds the maximum element's index, and `flip` function is used to swap elements, but the logic does not ensure that the list is sorted correctly for every case. For instance, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 0]`. The function would incorrectly sort this list as `[0, 2, 3, 4, 1]` instead of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. This indicates that the provided implementation does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
