Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the sorting algorithm as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to sort the entire list, but it only processes the list partially by finding the maximum element and swapping it to the end of the current subarray. This approach does not guarantee a fully sorted list after one pass through the list. For example, consider the list `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`. The code will first find the maximum element (8) and place it at the end, resulting in `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8] -> [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`. It will then move to the next subarray `[5, 1, 4, 2]` and repeat the process, but this will not ensure the list is fully sorted. Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
