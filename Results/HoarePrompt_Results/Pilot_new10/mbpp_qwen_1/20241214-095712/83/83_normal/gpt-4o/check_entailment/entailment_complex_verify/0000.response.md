Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly sort the entire list. Instead, it performs a series of swaps that only partially sort the list. Specifically, it finds the maximum element in each pass and places it at the end of the current subarray, but this approach fails to ensure the entire list is sorted. As an example, the input `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` would result in `[1, 3, 2, 2, 1]` after one iteration, which is not fully sorted. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of sorting the list of elements for every potential case, confirming the original assessment.
