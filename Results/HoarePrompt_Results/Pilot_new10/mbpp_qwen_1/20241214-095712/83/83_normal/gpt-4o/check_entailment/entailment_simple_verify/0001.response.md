Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code reveals that the provided function `func_1` does not actually perform a full sort of the array. The function iterates over the array from the largest size down to a size of 1, finding the maximum element in the current segment and swapping it with the last element, and then swapping the first and last elements. This process does not ensure that the entire array is sorted. For instance, consider the array `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. The function would swap the maximum element (5) with the last element (1), resulting in `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`, and then swap the first and last elements, ending up with `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, which is not sorted. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as the program does not correctly sort the list for all potential cases.
