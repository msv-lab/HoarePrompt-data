The code sets `max_index` to the current value of `i`. Given that the initial state is `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= len(arr), `max_index` is 0, and `i` is 1, and knowing that `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, the new value of `max_index` will be 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= len(arr), `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1.**
