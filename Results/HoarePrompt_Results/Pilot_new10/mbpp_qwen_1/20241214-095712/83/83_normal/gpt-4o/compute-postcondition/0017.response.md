Output State: **`arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `curr_size` is 1, `max_index` is not defined (or can be any value since it's out of scope), `n` is the original length of `arr` and is now less than 2.**

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop starts with `curr_size` as `n` and decrements by 1 until `curr_size` is 1.
   - For each iteration, it finds the index of the maximum element in the current subarray (`find_max_index(curr_size)`).
   - If the maximum element is not in the last position of the current subarray (`max_index != curr_size - 1`), it swaps the maximum element with the last element of the current subarray and flips the entire array up to the second-to-last element.

2. **Effect on Array**:
   - As the loop progresses, the largest element in the current subarray gets moved to its correct position in the sorted array.
   - After each iteration, the subarray size decreases by 1, and the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position.
   - When `curr_size` reaches 1, the loop terminates, and the array is fully sorted.

3. **Final State**:
   - Once the loop completes, the array `arr` will be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The variable `curr_size` will be 1, indicating that the smallest possible subarray (a single element) is being processed.
   - `max_index` will not be defined or relevant since the loop has completed.
   - The variable `n` will retain its original value but is no longer used as the loop condition since `curr_size` is now 1.

Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will be sorted, and the other variables will reflect the end state of the loop.
