Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program is correct because it uses the built-in `min` function and passes the provided test cases. However, the output hints indicate that the function should return the smallest integer in the list, even if the list is empty. According to Python's `min` function, an empty list will raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the function `func_1` should handle the case where the input list is empty by returning a specific value, such as `None` or raising an exception, rather than attempting to find the minimum value of an empty list. Since the current implementation does not handle this case, the original assessment is not accurate.
