Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. This approach works for all potential cases where `nums` is a non-empty list of integers. If `nums` is empty, `min()` will raise a `ValueError`, which is expected behavior according to the Python documentation. However, since the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle an empty list, we can assume that the function is intended to work with non-empty lists, and the built-in `min()` function handles this case appropriately by raising an exception. Given that the problem description asks for finding the smallest number in a list and the provided code accomplishes this for valid inputs, the function is correct.
