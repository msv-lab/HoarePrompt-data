Explanation: The provided program uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the list, which directly satisfies the problem description. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Since the function works as expected for the given examples and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
