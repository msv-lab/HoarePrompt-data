Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. This function will work for all potential cases as long as the input is a non-empty list of numbers. If the list is empty, `min()` will raise a `ValueError`, but the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, so we assume the function is expected to work with non-empty lists. Since the function meets the requirement for finding the smallest number in a non-empty list, it is considered correct.
