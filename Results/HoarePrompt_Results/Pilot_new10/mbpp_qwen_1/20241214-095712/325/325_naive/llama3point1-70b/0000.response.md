Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies months that have 30 days by checking if the given month number is in the list `[4, 6, 9, 11]`. This covers all the months that have exactly 30 days. There are no other months with 30 days, so this logic is complete and correct for the given problem description. Therefore, the program works correctly for every potential case.
