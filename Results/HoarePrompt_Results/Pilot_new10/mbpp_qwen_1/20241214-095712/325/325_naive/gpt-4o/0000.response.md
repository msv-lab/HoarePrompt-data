Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 30 days by comparing it against a set of month numbers known to have 30 days. The function works correctly for the provided test cases and, based on the problem description, this approach covers all potential cases. Months 4, 6, 9, and 11 are the only months with 30 days, and the function correctly identifies these months. For other months, it returns `False`, which is also correct according to the problem description. Since the function handles all potential cases as expected, the correctness is **True**.
