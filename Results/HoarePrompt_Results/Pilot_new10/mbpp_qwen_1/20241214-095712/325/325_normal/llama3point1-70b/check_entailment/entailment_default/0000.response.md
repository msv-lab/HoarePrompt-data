Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not check if the `month` is within the valid range of 1 to 12. According to the problem description, the function should handle month numbers from 1 to 12. However, the code will return `True` or `False` without verifying if the input `month` is within this range. For instance, if `month` is 13 or 0, the function will still execute and return a boolean value, which is incorrect. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
