The annotated code states that the function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` such that \(1 \leq \text{month} \leq 12\) and returns `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, the code only contains the return statement and does not check if `month` is within the range \(1 \leq \text{month} \leq 12\). This means that the function will not handle cases where `month` is outside this range, which would result in incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is:

**The function accepts an integer `month` and returns `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, otherwise it returns `False`. However, it does not check if `month` is within the valid range of 1 to 12, leading to incorrect results for values outside this range.**
