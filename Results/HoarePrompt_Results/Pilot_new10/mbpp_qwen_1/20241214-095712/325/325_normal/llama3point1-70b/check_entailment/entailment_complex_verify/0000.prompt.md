You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies months that have 30 days by checking if the given month number is in the list `[4, 6, 9, 11]`. This covers all the months that have exactly 30 days. There are no other months with 30 days, so this logic is complete and correct for the given problem description. Therefore, the program works correctly for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, otherwise False
#Overall this is what the function does:The annotated code states that the function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` such that \(1 \leq \text{month} \leq 12\) and returns `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, the code only contains the return statement and does not check if `month` is within the range \(1 \leq \text{month} \leq 12\). This means that the function will not handle cases where `month` is outside this range, which would result in incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is:

**The function accepts an integer `month` and returns `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, otherwise it returns `False`. However, it does not check if `month` is within the valid range of 1 to 12, leading to incorrect results for values outside this range.**

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
