Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given month (numbered from 1 to 12) has 30 days. According to the problem description, the function should check if the month is one of the months that contain 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

The program uses a list `thirty_days_months` containing the indices of the months with 30 days. It then checks if the given `month` parameter is present in this list using the `in` operator. If the month is found in the list, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Since the function correctly identifies the months with 30 days as specified in the problem description, the program is correct.
