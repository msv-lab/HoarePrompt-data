The code initializes a list `thirty_days_months` containing the integers `[4, 6, 9, 11]`. This list does not affect the value of the `month` variable, which remains an integer within the range 1 to 12. Therefore, the only information that changes is the definition of the list `thirty_days_months`.

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12; `thirty_days_months` is [4, 6, 9, 11]**
