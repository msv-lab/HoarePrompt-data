Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not check if the input `month` is within the valid range of 1 to 12. According to the problem description, the function should only return `True` for months that have 30 days (i.e., April, June, September, and November) and `False` for other months. However, the function will return `True` for any month number that is 4, 6, 9, or 11, even if those numbers are outside the valid range of 1 to 12. For example, if the input is 13, the function will still return `False`, but it should raise an error or return `False` without claiming that 13 has 30 days. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
