Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 30 days by comparing it against a set of month numbers known to have 30 days. The output hints provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for the specified cases (months 4, 6, 9, and 11 returning `True`, and other months returning `False`). Since the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem description and the output hints, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
