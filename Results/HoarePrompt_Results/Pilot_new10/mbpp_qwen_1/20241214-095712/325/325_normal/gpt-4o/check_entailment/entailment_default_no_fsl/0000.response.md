Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if the given month has 30 days by seeing if the month number is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`. This correctly identifies the months with 30 days as specified in the problem description. Since the code handles all potential cases (i.e., months 1 through 12), and the assertions provided in the output hints are satisfied, the code is correct for every potential case.
