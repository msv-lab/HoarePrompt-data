You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 30 days. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` which contains the numbers of the months that have 30 days: 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles all the test cases provided:
- For month 6, it returns `True` because June has 30 days.
- For month 2, it returns `False` because February typically does not have 30 days (it usually has 28 or 29 days).
- For month 12, it returns `False` because December does not have 30 days.

Additionally, the function will correctly handle other potential cases:
- Month 1 (January): False
- Month 3 (March): False
- Month 5 (May): False
- Month 7 (July): False
- Month 8 (August): False
- Month 10 (October): False
- Month 11 (November): False

Since the function correctly identifies months with 30 days and those without, and since no other potential cases violate the problem description, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `month` (1 ≤ month ≤ 12) and returns `True` if the month has 30 days, specifically if the month is 4, 6, 9, or 11. If the month does not match any of these, it returns `False`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
