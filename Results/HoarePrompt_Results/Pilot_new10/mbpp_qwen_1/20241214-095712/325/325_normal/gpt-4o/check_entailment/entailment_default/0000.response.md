Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to determine if a given month number contains 30 days. The function `func_1` checks if the month is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`, which are the months that have 30 days. For all the provided test cases (month 6, month 2, and month 12), the function returns the correct boolean values (`True`, `False`, and `False` respectively). The function handles all potential cases for month numbers from 1 to 12 accurately, as per the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
