The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and updates `a` to be the sum of its original value and the original value of `b`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 5. After the assignment, `a` becomes 7 (since `a + b` is `2 + 5`), and `b` takes the original value of `a`, which is 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 7, `b` is 2**
