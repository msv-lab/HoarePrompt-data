Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the Lucas sequence for non-negative integers. The original assessment was accurate because the function does not handle cases where the input `n` is negative or not an integer. Although the annotated version assumes valid input, according to best practices and typical expectations, the function should include input validation to handle such cases appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment of the function being incorrect due to lack of input validation is valid.
