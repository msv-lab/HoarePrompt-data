Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the (n-1)th Fibonacci number (where the first Fibonacci number is 1 and the second is 2) for any other non-negative integer `n`.** 

This summary covers all potential cases as described by both the annotated code and the return postconditions.
