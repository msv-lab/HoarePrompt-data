Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The problem description asks to write a function to find the n-th Lucas number. However, the provided implementation actually calculates the n-th Fibonacci number, not the Lucas number.

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n > 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- For n > 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

The given code correctly implements the Fibonacci sequence, but it does so by starting with different initial values (L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1), which happens to match the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(2) = 1 and F(3) = 2. Therefore, the function `func_1(n)` will return the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number for any given n, rather than the n-th Lucas number.

To meet the problem description, the function should implement the Lucas sequence directly. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This corrected version will now correctly compute the n-th Lucas number.
