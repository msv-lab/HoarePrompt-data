`a` and `b` are swapped, and `b` is also updated to `a + b`. Given the initial values, `a` is 3 and `b` is 2.

- Initially, `a` is 3.
- Initially, `b` is 2.
- After swapping, `a` becomes `b`, which is 2.
- After updating `b`, `b` becomes `a + b`, which is `2 + 3` or 5.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 5.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 5**
