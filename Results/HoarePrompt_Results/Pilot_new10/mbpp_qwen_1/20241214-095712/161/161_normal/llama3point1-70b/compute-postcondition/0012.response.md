`a` and `b` are reassigned such that `a` gets the value of `b` (which is 4) and `b` gets the value of `a + b`. Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4, so `b` becomes `3 + 4` which is 7. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 4; `b` is 7; `n` must be at least 4.

Output State: **`a` is 4; `b` is 7; `n` must be at least 4**
