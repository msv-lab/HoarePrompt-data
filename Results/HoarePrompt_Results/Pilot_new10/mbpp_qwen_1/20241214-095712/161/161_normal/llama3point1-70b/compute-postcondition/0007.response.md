Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 and 1. This means `n` must be a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `range(2, n + 1)`. For the loop to execute, the start of the range (2) must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `n` must be a positive integer greater than 1 and the loop runs from 2 to `n`, `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to ensure it meets this condition.

4. **Final State**:
   - `a` remains 2.
   - `b` remains 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

So, the required state adjustments are as follows:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `a` is 2.
- `b` is 1.

The final state to ensure the loop executes is:
State: **`a` is 2, `b` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
