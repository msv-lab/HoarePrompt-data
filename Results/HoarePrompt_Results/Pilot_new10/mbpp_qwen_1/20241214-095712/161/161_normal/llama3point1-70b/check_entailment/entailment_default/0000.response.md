Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the Lucas sequence as described. According to the problem description, the function should return the n-th Lucas number. However, the output hints indicate that the function returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number instead. Specifically, the function:

- Returns 2 when `n` is 0, which is correct for the 0th Lucas number.
- Returns 1 when `n` is 1, which is also correct for the 1st Lucas number.
- For `n >= 2`, it returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number, which is incorrect. The correct n-th Lucas number for `n >= 2` should be calculated as `L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}` where `L_0 = 2` and `L_1 = 1`.

For example, for `n = 2`, the correct Lucas number is 3, but the function returns the 4th Fibonacci number, which is 3. However, for `n = 3`, the correct Lucas number is 4, but the function returns the 5th Fibonacci number, which is 5. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
