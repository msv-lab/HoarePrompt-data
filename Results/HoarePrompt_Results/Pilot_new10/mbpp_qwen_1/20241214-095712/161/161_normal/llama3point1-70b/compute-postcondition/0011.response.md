According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, and `n` must be at least 3.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop runs from 2 to `n` inclusive.
2. After the last iteration, `n` must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue.
3. Since the loop has already run from 2 to some value up to `n`, the next possible value for the loop's iterator would be `n + 1`.

Given that the loop has just completed its iterations, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must now be at least 4 (since it previously was at least 3 and now needs to be incremented to allow the loop to run again).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is 3, `b` is 4, `n` must be at least 4**
