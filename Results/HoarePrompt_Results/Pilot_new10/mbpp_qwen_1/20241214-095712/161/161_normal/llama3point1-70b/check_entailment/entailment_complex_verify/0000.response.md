Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly states that the program correctly implements the logic for finding the n-th Lucas number. According to the Lucas sequence definition, \(L(0) = 2\) and \(L(1) = 1\), and for \(n > 1\), \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\). However, the program incorrectly computes the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number. The Fibonacci sequence starts with \(F(0) = 0\) and \(F(1) = 1\), so the state annotation at the end of the for loop indicates that `b` is the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number, not the n-th Lucas number. Therefore, the program does not produce the correct result for the Lucas sequence as specified in the problem description.
