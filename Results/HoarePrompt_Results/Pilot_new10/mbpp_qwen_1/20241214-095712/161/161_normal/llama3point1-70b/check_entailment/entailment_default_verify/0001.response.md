Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the n'th Lucas number. However, the output hints indicate that the function returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. According to the definition of Lucas numbers, \( L(n) \) should be computed as \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \) with initial conditions \( L(0) = 2 \) and \( L(1) = 1 \). The provided function correctly follows this definition and computes the n'th Lucas number directly without involving Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the function correctly implements the Lucas sequence, not a modified Fibonacci sequence.
