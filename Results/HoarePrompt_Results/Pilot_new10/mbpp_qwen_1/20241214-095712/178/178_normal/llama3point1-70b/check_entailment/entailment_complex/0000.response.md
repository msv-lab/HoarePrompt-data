Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number in the list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. This matches exactly what the problem description asks for: rounding every number in the given list and printing the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The program will work for any list of numbers (both floats and integers), as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
