Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Rounding Each Number**: The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers` and applies the `round()` function to each number. This ensures that every number in the list is rounded to the nearest integer.
2. **Calculating the Sum**: After rounding, the program calculates the sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum()` function.
3. **Multiplying by Length**: Finally, the program multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list `numbers`.

Since the program performs all these steps correctly as described in the problem statement, it will produce the correct result for any given list of numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
