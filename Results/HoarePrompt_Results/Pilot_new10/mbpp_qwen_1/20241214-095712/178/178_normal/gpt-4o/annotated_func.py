#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of floating-point or integer numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #`The program returns the result which is total_sum * len(numbers) where total_sum is the sum of all elements in rounded_numbers and len(numbers) is the length of the list numbers`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (floating-point or integer), rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the input list, and returns the result.
