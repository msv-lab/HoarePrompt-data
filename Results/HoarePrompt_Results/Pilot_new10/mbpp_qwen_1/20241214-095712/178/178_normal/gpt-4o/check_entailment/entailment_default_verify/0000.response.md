Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the input list, and returns the result. The output hints align with the function's behavior as described in the problem statement and the test cases provided. There is no evidence from the code or the problem description that suggests the function is incorrect for any valid input.
