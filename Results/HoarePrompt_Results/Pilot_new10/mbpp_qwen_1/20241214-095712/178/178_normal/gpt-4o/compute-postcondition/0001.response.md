The code `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)` calculates the sum of all elements in the `rounded_numbers` list and assigns this sum to the variable `total_sum`. The `rounded_numbers` list remains unchanged, and the `numbers` list is also not affected.

Therefore, the output state is: `numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
