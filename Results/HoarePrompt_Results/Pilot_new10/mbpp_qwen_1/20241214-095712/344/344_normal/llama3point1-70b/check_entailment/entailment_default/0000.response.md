Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the smallest index `i` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such index exists, it returns the length of the list. This matches the problem description perfectly.

The function handles all potential cases as follows:
- If the value is less than the first element, it returns 0.
- If the value is between elements, it returns the appropriate index.
- If the value is greater than or equal to the last element, it returns the length of the list.

Given the analysis, the function works correctly for every potential case.
