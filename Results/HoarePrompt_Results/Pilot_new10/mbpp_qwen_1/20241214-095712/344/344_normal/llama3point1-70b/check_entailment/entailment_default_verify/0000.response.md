Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the list and returns the index where the value would fit while maintaining the sorted order. The function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct position to insert the value to keep the list sorted. The provided code and the problem description align perfectly, and there are no edge cases or missing logic as stated in the original assessment.
