You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Output hints: Let's analyze the given code and annotations step by step to determine the functionality of the function `func_1`.

### Analysis

1. **Parameters**:
   - `sorted_list`: A list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `value`: An integer or float.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The function iterates through each element in `sorted_list` using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`.
   - If such an element is found, the function immediately returns the index `i`.
   - If the loop completes without finding such an element, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations suggest multiple possible return values (0, 1, 2, or the length of `sorted_list`).
   - However, the actual code only returns the index `i` where `sorted_list[i] >= value` or the length of `sorted_list` if no such index exists.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `value` is less than the first element of `sorted_list`, the function should return 0.
   - If `value` is greater than or equal to the first element but less than the second element, the function should return 1.
   - If `value` is greater than or equal to the last element, the function should return the length of `sorted_list`.

### Summary

Based on the code and the actual behavior, the function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the smallest index `i` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such index exists, it returns the length of the list.

### Functionality

**The function accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the smallest index `i` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such index exists, it returns the length of the list.**

This summary covers all potential cases and reflects the actual behavior of the function.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
