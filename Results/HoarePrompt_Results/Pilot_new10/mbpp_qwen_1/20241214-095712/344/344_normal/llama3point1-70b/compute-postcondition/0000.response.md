State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is 0, and `len(sorted_list)` must be greater than 0**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `len(sorted_list) - 1`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` should be `0` for the loop to start its first iteration.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition `range(len(sorted_list))` means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(sorted_list)`. Therefore, `len(sorted_list)` must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute even once.
4. **Other Variables**: The states of other variables (`sorted_list` and `value`) provided do not affect the loop's ability to execute directly but should remain consistent with their given states.

By ensuring these conditions, the loop can proceed correctly.
