Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `value` is an integer or float.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range of the length of `sorted_list`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Since `sorted_list` is sorted in non-decreasing order, if `sorted_list[1]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function would return 1 and the loop would terminate without further iterations.
   - However, since there is no return statement inside the loop body (only the condition to return 1), we assume the loop continues unless `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `sorted_list[i]` should still be less than `value`.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will increment to 2 in the next iteration.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `sorted_list` remains unchanged.
   - `value` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `value` is an integer or float, and `i` is 2**.
