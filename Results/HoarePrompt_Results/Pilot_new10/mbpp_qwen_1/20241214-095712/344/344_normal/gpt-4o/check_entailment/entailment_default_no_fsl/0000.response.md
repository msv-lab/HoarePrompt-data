Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which correctly finds the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list to maintain the sorted order. The examples given in the output hints and assertions cover various cases, including inserting a value that is greater than any element in the list (returning the length of the list) and inserting a value that is less than any element in the list (returning 0). Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and the `bisect_right` function is designed to handle all potential edge cases, the code is correct for every potential case described in the problem.
