The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is an integer or float. The function returns the index in `sorted_list` where `value` would fit such that `sorted_list` remains sorted (i.e., the rightmost place to insert `value` to keep the list sorted).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `sorted_list` of integers or floats that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a value. It returns the index in `sorted_list` where `value` would fit to maintain the sorted order.**
