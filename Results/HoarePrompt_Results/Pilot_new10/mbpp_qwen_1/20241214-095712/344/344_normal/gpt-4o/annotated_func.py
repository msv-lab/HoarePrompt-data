#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index in the sorted_list where the value would fit such that the sorted_list remains sorted (i.e., the rightmost place to insert value to keep the list sorted)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` of integers or floats and a value. It returns the index in `sorted_list` where the `value` would fit to maintain the sorted order. This index is the rightmost position where the value can be inserted without violating the sorted order of the list.
