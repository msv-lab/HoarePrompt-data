Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only those key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to achieve this, and the annotations confirm that it handles all necessary cases as per the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned that would render the function incorrect under the given assumptions.
