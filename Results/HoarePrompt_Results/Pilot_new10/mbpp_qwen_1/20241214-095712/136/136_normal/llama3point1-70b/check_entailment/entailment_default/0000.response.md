Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The dictionary comprehension used in the function ensures that only the desired key-value pairs are included in the returned dictionary. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this implementation to fail based on the problem description and the output hints.
