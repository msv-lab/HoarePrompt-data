Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by filtering the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the desired key-value pairs. This approach works for all potential cases where the dictionary values are integers and the input `n` is also an integer. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or output hints that this function does not handle correctly.
