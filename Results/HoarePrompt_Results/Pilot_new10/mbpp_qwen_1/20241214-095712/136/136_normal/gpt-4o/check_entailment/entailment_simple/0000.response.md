Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's a breakdown of why this program is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function signature matches the expected inputs: a dictionary and an integer.
2. **Dictionary Comprehension**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items in the input dictionary `d` and includes only those key-value pairs where the value (`v`) is greater than or equal to `n`.
3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test different scenarios:
   - The first assertion checks if the function correctly filters out keys with values less than 170.
   - The second assertion checks if the function correctly filters out keys with values less than 180.
   - The third assertion checks if the function correctly filters out keys with values less than 190.

Since the function implementation and the provided assertions all align with the problem description, the program is correct.
