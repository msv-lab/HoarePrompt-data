You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
Program:
```
assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 170) == {'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}
assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 180) == {'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}
assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 190) == {'Pierre Cox': 190}

def func_1(d: dict, n: int) -> dict:
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The assertions given in the problem description cover various scenarios, including cases where the minimum value in the filtered dictionary matches `n`, cases where multiple values match `n`, and cases where no values in the dictionary meet the criteria. Since the function works correctly for all the provided test cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` and a comparable value `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This holds true for all potential cases, including dictionaries with non-comparable values for `n`, and considering that `n` can be any type that supports comparison (e.g., integers, floats). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
