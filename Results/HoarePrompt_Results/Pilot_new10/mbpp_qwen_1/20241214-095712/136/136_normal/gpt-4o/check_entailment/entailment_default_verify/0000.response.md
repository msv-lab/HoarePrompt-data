Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function handles all potential cases, including non-comparable values for `n` and considering that `n` can be any type that supports comparison. The assertions given in the problem description cover various scenarios, and the logic of the function is sound. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
