Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary `d` and includes only those pairs where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given the assertions provided:
- When `n = 170`, the function returns `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which correctly excludes 'Kierra Gentry' since her value is 165.
- When `n = 180`, the function returns `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which correctly excludes both 'Cierra Vega' and 'Kierra Gentry'.
- When `n = 190`, the function returns `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which correctly excludes all other keys since their values are less than 190.

The function handles all the provided test cases correctly. The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, filtering the dictionary based on the value threshold. There are no obvious cases where the function would fail to meet the problem description, and thus the function appears to be correct for every potential case.
