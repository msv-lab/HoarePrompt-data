Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The assertions given in the problem description cover various scenarios, including cases where the minimum value in the filtered dictionary matches `n`, cases where multiple values match `n`, and cases where no values in the dictionary meet the criteria. Since the function works correctly for all the provided test cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct for the given problem description.
