Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers correctly. Let's verify this with the given test cases:

- For `n = 2`, the first two even natural numbers are `[2, 4]`. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `n = 3`, the first three even natural numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
- For `n = 4`, the first four even natural numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

The function correctly generates the even numbers using a list comprehension and calculates the cube sum using a generator expression. Since the function passes all the provided test cases and seems to handle the general case correctly, the program is correct.
