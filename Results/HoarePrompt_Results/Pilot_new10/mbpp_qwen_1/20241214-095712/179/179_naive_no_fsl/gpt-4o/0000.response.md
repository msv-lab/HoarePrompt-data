Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions provided in the test cases also validate this behavior:

- For `n = 2`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`, and their cubes sum to `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.
- For `n = 3`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`, and their cubes sum to `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.
- For `n = 4`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, and their cubes sum to `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`.

The function generates the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension and then calculates their cube sum using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. Since the provided test cases cover multiple values of `n` and the function passes all these tests, we can conclude that the function works correctly for the described problem. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues with the current implementation.
