Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

- The function `func_1(n)` takes a single positive integer `n` as input.
- It calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
- The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.
- The expression `i ** 3` computes the cube of each even number within this range.
- Finally, the `sum()` function adds these cubes together and returns the result.

For any positive integer `n`, the program will correctly compute the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, thus meeting the problem description accurately.
