Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly describe the functionality of the `func_1(n)` function. The function indeed calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers as specified in the problem description. The annotation correctly states that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`. Since the original assessment concluded that the function is correct and the annotated version supports this conclusion, the original assessment remains accurate.
