The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function calculates the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n*2 + 1`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n*2 + 1`.
