Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. This matches the problem description exactly.

2. **Correct Calculation**: The list comprehension `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` generates the first `n` even natural numbers, which are `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2n]`.

3. **Cube Sum Calculation**: The line `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers. This computation is correct and aligns with the requirement to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

4. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, `assert func_1(4) == 800`) verify the correctness of the function for different values of `n`. These test cases match the expected results derived from the formula \(2n^2(n+1)^2\).

5. **Edge Case Handling**: While the problem statement specifies that the input `n` should be a positive integer, the function does not explicitly handle non-positive integers. However, the test cases provided only include positive integers, and the function works correctly for them.

Since the function correctly implements the required functionality for all tested cases, it can be concluded that the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
