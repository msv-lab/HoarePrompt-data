Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works as expected for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

The code generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. Then, it computes the sum of the cubes of these numbers using a generator expression `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` inside the `sum()` function. This approach ensures that the function returns the correct sum for any positive integer `n`.

Since the code handles all provided test cases and the logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
