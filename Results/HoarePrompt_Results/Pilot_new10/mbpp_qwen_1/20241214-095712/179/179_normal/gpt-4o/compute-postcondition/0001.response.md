The code calculates the sum of cubes of all even numbers from 2 to `2 * n` and assigns it to `cube_sum`. The even numbers in the list `even_numbers` range from 2 to `2 * n`. Let's calculate `cube_sum`:

- The even numbers are: `2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n`.
- The cubes of these numbers are: \(2^3, 4^3, 6^3, \ldots, (2 * n)^3\).

The sum of these cubes is:
\[ cube\_sum = 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + \ldots + (2 * n)^3 \]

We can express this as:
\[ cube\_sum = 8(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \ldots + n^3) \]

Using the formula for the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, which is:
\[ 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \ldots + n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 \]

Therefore:
\[ cube\_sum = 8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 = 2n^2(n+1)^2 \]

So, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer; `even_numbers` is a list containing the even numbers from 2 to `2 * n`; `cube_sum` is `2n^2(n+1)^2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `even_numbers` is a list containing the even numbers from 2 to `2 * n`; `cube_sum` is `2n^2(n+1)^2`.**
