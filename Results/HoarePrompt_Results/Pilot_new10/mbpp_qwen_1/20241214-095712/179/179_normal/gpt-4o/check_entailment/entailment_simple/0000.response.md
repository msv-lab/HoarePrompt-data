Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.
   
2. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes an input `n`, which represents the number of the first even natural numbers whose cubes are to be summed.
   - It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
     - For example, if `n = 2`, `even_numbers` will be `[2, 4]`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using another list comprehension: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
     - For `n = 2`, `cube_sum` will be `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, `assert func_1(4) == 800`) confirm that the function works correctly for these specific cases.
     - For `n = 2`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`, and their cubes are `8 + 64 = 72`.
     - For `n = 3`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`, and their cubes are `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.
     - For `n = 4`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, and their cubes are `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`.

4. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula `2n^2(n+1)^2` is derived from the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
   - The provided assertions can be verified using this formula:
     - For `n = 2`: \(2 \times 2^2 \times (2+1)^2 = 2 \times 4 \times 9 = 72\).
     - For `n = 3`: \(2 \times 3^2 \times (3+1)^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 16 = 288\).
     - For `n = 4`: \(2 \times 4^2 \times (4+1)^2 = 2 \times 16 \times 25 = 800\).

Since the function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the logic to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers and the provided assertions hold true, the program is correct according to the problem description.
