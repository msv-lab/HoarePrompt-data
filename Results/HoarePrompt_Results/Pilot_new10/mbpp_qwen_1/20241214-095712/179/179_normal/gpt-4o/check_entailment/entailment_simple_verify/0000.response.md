Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program, showing that `even_numbers` is generated as a list of the first `n` even numbers, and `cube_sum` is computed as the sum of their cubes. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
