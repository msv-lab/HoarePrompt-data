Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of digits (e.g., 121, 353, 12121). The function converts the number to a string and then checks if the length of the string is at least 3. It then ensures that the first two digits are different and iterates through the rest of the string, checking that the digits at even indices match the first digit and the digits at odd indices match the second digit. Based on the provided test cases and the logic implemented, the function correctly identifies undulating numbers and returns `False` for non-undulating numbers. No edge cases or potential inputs were found where the function fails to meet the problem description.
