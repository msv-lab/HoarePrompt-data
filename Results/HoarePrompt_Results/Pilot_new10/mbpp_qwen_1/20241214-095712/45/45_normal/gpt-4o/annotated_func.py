#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, and the loop has executed for all valid `i` values such that `2 <= i < len(s)`. If any condition inside the loop evaluates to `False`, the function returns `False` at that point. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the length of the string is at least 3. It then verifies that the first and second digits of the string are different and that for all subsequent digits, even-indexed digits are not equal to the first digit and odd-indexed digits are not equal to the second digit. If any condition fails, the function returns `False`. If all conditions pass, the function returns `True`.
