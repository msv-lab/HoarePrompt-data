Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the number starts with two identical digits, which violates the definition of an undulating number. For example, the number `112` should return `False` because the first two digits are the same. However, the current implementation does not check this condition explicitly, leading to incorrect results for such cases. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
