The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_digit`. Since `s` is a string representation of the positive integer `n` and the length of `s` is at least 3, the first digit of `n` (as a string) is stored in `first_digit`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`**
