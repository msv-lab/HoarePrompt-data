Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 3, and `i % 2 != 0`. If `i % 2 == 1` and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.***
