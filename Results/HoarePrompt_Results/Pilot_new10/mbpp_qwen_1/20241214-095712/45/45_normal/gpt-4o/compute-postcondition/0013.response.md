Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, and `i` is 2 with `i % 2 != 0` or `s[i] == first_digit`. Additionally, the current value of `i` is even and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`***
