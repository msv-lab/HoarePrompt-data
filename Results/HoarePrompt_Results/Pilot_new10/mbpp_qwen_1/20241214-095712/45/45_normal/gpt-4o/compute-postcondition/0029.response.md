Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the length of the string is at least 3. It then verifies that the first and second digits of the string are different and that for all subsequent digits, even-indexed digits are not equal to the first digit and odd-indexed digits are not equal to the second digit. If any condition fails, the function returns `False`. If all conditions pass, the function returns `True`. **
