The code `pass` does nothing and does not affect any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `undulating` is `True` if the undulating condition is satisfied, otherwise `undulating` is `False`.**
