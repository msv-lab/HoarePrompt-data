Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 3 characters. If for some index `i` (1 <= i < len(n) - 1), the current value of `n[i-1]` is less than `n[i]` which is less than `n[i+1]`, or `n[i-1]` is greater than `n[i]` which is greater than `n[i+1]`, then `undulating` remains `True`. Otherwise, `undulating` becomes `False`.***
