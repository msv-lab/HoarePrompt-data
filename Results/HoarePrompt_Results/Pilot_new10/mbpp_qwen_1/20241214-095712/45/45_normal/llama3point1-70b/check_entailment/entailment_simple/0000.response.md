Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the input number `n` is undulating or not according to the provided problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires checking if the given number is undulating. A number is considered undulating if its digits alternate between increasing and decreasing consecutively.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function first converts the integer `n` to a string representation using `n = str(n)`.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `undulating` to `True`.
   - It then iterates through the string representation of `n` starting from the second character up to the second last character (`range(1, len(n) - 1)`).
   - For each character at index `i`, it checks if the current digit `n[i]` alternates properly:
     - Either `n[i-1] < n[i] < n[i+1]` (the digits are increasing),
     - Or `n[i-1] > n[i] > n[i+1]` (the digits are decreasing).
   - If the alternating condition fails at any point, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, the function returns the value of `undulating`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles strings with at least three characters since the loop starts from index 1 and ends at `len(n) - 1`.
   - If the string has fewer than three characters, the loop will not execute, and `undulating` remains `True`, which is correct because single or double-digit numbers cannot be undulating.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly identifies undulating numbers as per the definition provided in the problem description.
   - It correctly returns `True` for undulating numbers and `False` for non-undulating numbers.

Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible cases.
