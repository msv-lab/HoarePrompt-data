The code sets `undulating` to `False`. The initial value of `undulating` is `True`, so it changes to `False`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 3 characters; `undulating` is `False`**
