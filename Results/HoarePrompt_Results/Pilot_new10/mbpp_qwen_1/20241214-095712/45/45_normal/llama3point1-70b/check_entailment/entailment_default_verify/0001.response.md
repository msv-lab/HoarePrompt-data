Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` only checks one pair of consecutive digits in the middle of the string representation of the number to determine if the number is undulating. According to the problem description, an undulating number should have a pattern where the digits alternate in a specific pattern throughout the entire number. The function does not check this condition for the entire length of the number, which leads to incorrect results for numbers like `1234`. The output hints confirm that the function should check the alternating pattern for every index `i` (1 <= i < len(n) - 1), and the current implementation fails to do so, making the original assessment correct.
