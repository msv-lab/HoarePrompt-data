Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` and an integer `size` as inputs, which matches the problem description.

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The function merges the two lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the resulting list. This ensures that the final `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from both `list1` and `list2`.

3. **Middle Index Calculation**: The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which correctly identifies the position around which the median lies. Note that since the list is zero-indexed, `size - 1` gives the last index of the first half of the list (or the second last if the list length is even).

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - If `size` is even, the median is the average of the elements at `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1`. This correctly calculates the median for an even-sized merged list.
   - If `size` is odd, the median is the element at `middle_index`. This correctly calculates the median for an odd-sized merged list.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated median, which aligns with the problem description.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly finds the median of the merged and sorted list formed by combining two sorted lists of the same size. Therefore, the program is correct.
