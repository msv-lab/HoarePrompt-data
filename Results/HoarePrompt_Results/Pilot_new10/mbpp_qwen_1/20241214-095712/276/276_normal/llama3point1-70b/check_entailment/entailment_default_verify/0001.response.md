Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly calculate the median for lists of even size. The `middle_index` variable is set to `size - 1`, which leads to accessing an out-of-bounds index for even-sized lists. The output hints confirm that for even-sized lists, the function should return the average of the elements at indices `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2` in the merged list, not `size - 1` and `size`. Therefore, the original assessment correctly points out the issue with the program's implementation.
