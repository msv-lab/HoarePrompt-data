The code concatenates `list1` and `list2` into a single list and then sorts it. The resulting list is assigned to `merged_list`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are sorted and of the same size, the merged and sorted list will also be sorted. The sizes of `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged, denoted by `size`.

Output State: **`merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, formed by merging and sorting `list1` and `list2`; `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer.**
