Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment was not accurate. The program correctly handles the cases where both lists are non-empty and of the same size, and it computes the median as expected. The annotations clearly state that the program works under the assumption that the inputs are valid (i.e., both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same size and `size` is a positive integer). Therefore, the program does not have issues with empty lists or invalid inputs as initially assessed.
