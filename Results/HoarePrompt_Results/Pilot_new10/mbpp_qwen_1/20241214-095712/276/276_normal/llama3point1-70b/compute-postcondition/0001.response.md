The code assigns the value of `size - 1` to the variable `middle_index`. Since `size` is a positive integer representing the size of both `list1` and `list2`, and `merged_list` is a sorted list formed by merging and sorting `list1` and `list2`, the only change here is the assignment to `middle_index`. The states of `merged_list`, `list1`, `list2`, and `size` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, formed by merging and sorting `list1` and `list2`; `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer; `middle_index` is `size - 1`.**
