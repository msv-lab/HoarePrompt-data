Postcondition: ***`merged_list` is a sorted list of integers formed by merging and sorting `list1` and `list2`; `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (`size`), and `size` is a positive integer; `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the element at index `size - 1` in `merged_list`.***
