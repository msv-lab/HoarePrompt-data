You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`merged_list` is a sorted list of integers formed by merging and sorting `list1` and `list2`; `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (`size`), and `size` is a positive integer; `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the element at index `size - 1` in `merged_list`.
    return median
    #`The program returns the median of the merged_list, which is the average of merged_list[size - 1] and merged_list[size] if size is even, or the element at index size - 1 if size is odd`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, and returns the median of the merged and sorted list. Specifically, if `size` is even, it returns the average of the elements at indices `size - 1` and `size` in the merged list. If `size` is odd, it returns the element at index `size - 1` in the merged list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
