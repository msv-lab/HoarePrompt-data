Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the requirement to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: Although the problem description mentions that `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of the same size, the program does not explicitly validate these conditions. However, the core logic still works correctly assuming these conditions hold true.

2. **Merging Lists**: The program merges `list1` and `list2` into `merged_list` using the `sorted()` function, ensuring that the resulting list is sorted. This step is necessary because the definition of the median requires the data to be in a sorted order.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - The program calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`, which correctly identifies the position to check for the median.
   - If the size of the combined list is even (`size % 2 == 0`), it calculates the median as the average of the elements at `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1`.
   - If the size is odd, it sets the median to the element at `middle_index`.

4. **Return Value**: The program returns the calculated median value, which is either the average of the two middle elements or the single middle element, depending on whether the total number of elements is even or odd.

Since the program correctly handles all cases described in the problem statement and adheres to the logic required for finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size, the program is correct.
