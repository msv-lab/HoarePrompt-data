The code assigns the value at `merged_list[middle_index]` to the variable `median`. Given that `middle_index` is `size - 1` and `size` is a positive odd integer, `middle_index` is also an even number (since size - 1 of an odd number is even). The value of `median` is therefore the element at the position `size - 1` in the `merged_list`.

Output State: **`merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (`size`), `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `size` is a positive odd integer, and `median` is the element at index `size - 1` in `merged_list`.**
