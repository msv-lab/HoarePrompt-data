Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where the lists are not of the same size, but the annotated version of the code clarifies that the inputs `list1` and `list2` are guaranteed to be of the same size and valid. The function `func_1` correctly computes the median of the combined sorted list, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Since the annotated version provides this important context, the original assessment is not accurate.
