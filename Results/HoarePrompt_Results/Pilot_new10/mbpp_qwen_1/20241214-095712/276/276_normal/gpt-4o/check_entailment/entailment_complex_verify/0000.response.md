Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the problem description clearly state that the two input lists are already sorted and of the same size. The program correctly handles these conditions and calculates the median based on the merged list. The original assessment incorrectly mentions that the program does not handle the case where the lists are not of the same size because the problem description explicitly states they will be of the same size. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
