Postcondition: ***`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with size 2n, `mid` is n. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.***
