Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the problem description specifies that the two input lists are already sorted and of the same size. However, the provided code does not check if the lists are of the same size before merging them. This means the program can fail for inputs where the lists are not of the same size, as demonstrated in the output hints and the example provided. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
