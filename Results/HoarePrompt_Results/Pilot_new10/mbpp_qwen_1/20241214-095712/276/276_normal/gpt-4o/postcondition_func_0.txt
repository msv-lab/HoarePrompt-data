The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size `n`, merges them into a single sorted list `merged_list`, and returns the median of this merged list. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element.
