Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided merges the two sorted lists and then calculates the median based on the merged list. However, the problem description specifies that the two input lists are already sorted and of the same size. The solution works correctly for the provided test cases, but it does not handle the case where the lists are not of the same size.

For example, consider the following inputs:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 3)  # The second list has only 3 elements, not 3.
```

In this case, the function will fail because the lists are not of the same size. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
