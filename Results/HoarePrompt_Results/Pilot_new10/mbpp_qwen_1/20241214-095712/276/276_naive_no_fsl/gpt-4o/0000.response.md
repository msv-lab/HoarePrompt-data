Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. Since the lists are of the same size and the function handles both even and odd lengths correctly, it appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness.
