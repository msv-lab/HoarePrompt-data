`s` is split into a list of words using the `split()` method. The `split()` method splits the string `s` at each whitespace and returns a list of substrings. Therefore, `words` is assigned the list of words from the string `s`. The string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string; `words` is a list of words from the string `s`.**
