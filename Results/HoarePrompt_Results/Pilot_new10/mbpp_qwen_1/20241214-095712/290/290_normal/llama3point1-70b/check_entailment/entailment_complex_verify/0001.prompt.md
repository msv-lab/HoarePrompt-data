You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last characters) for each word in the input string. Here's why:

1. The function splits the input string into words using `split()`.
2. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character contains 'z'.
3. If such a condition is met for any word, the function returns `True`.
4. If no word meets the condition after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

Given these steps, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description for any input string. There are no potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements since it correctly handles the conditions specified.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from the string `s`, and the function returns `True` if any word in the list has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' excluding the first and last characters. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if any word in the list of words derived from `s` has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' within the middle of the word (excluding the first and last characters). Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
