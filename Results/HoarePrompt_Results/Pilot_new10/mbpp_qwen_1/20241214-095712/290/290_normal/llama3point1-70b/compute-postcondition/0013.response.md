The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string. The function returns True in three cases and False in one case. 

- Case_1: The program returns True
- Case_2: The program returns True
- Case_3: The program returns True if the third word in the list 'words' has a length greater than 1 and the character 'z' is present in the word excluding the first and last characters
- Case_4: The program returns False

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return True in three specified conditions and False in one condition.
