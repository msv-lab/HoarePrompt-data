Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from the string `s` that must contain at least two words, and `word` is the second word in the list `words`. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and the character 'z' is present in `word` excluding the first and last characters, the function returns True. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
