Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a single string `s` as input.
2. **Splitting the String**: The string `s` is split into a list of words using `s.split()`. This ensures that each word is treated separately.
3. **Iterating Over Words**: For each word in the list of words, the function checks if the word has more than one character (`len(word) > 1`) and if the substring excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`) contains the letter 'z'.
4. **Return Logic**:
   - If any word meets the criteria (i.e., it has more than one character and contains 'z' in the middle), the function returns `True`.
   - If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

The program handles all cases as required by the problem description. It correctly identifies whether any word within the input string contains 'z' excluding the first and last characters. Therefore, the program is correct.
