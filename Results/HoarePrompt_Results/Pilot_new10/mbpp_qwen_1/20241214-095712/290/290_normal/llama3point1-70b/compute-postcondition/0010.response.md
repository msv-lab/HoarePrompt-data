Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from the string `s` that must contain at least two words, and `word` is either the third word in the list `words` or remains the second word depending on the condition. If the third word in the list `words` has a length greater than 1 and the character 'z' is present in the word excluding the first and last characters, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function continues to process the next word in the list.***
