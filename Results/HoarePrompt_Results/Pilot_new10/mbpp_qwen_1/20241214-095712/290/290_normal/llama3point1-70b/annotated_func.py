#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from the string `s`, and the function returns `True` if any word in the list has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' excluding the first and last characters. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if any word in the list of words derived from `s` has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' within the middle of the word (excluding the first and last characters). Otherwise, it returns `False`.
