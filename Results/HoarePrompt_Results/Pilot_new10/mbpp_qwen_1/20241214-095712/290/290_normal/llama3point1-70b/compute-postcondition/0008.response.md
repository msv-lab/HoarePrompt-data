Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string.
   - `words` is a list of words from the string `s` that must contain at least two words.
   - `word` is the second word in the list `words`.
   
2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each word in the list `words`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `word` is the second word in the list `words`.
   - The loop body has been executed for the second word.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, we need to move to the third word in the list `words`.
   - The condition for returning `True` (if the length of `word` is greater than 1 and the character 'z' is present in `word` excluding the first and last characters) does not affect the next iteration directly since we are simply moving to the next word in the list.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since we are moving to the third word in the list `words`, `word` will be the third word.
   - The list `words` must still contain at least two words.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from the string `s` that must contain at least two words, and `word` is the third word in the list `words`.**
