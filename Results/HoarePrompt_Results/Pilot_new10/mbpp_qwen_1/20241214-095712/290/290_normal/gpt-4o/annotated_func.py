#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a string, and 'z' is not in the substring s[1:-1]
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if the substring excluding the first and last characters contains the letter 'z'. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
