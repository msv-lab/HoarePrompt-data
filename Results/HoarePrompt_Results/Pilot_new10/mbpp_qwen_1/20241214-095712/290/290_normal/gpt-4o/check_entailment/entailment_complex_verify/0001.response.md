Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` only checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]` without considering whether 'z' is part of a word. As per the problem description, 'z' should not be at the start or end of a word, which means 'z' should not be immediately preceded or followed by a non-whitespace character. The current implementation does not account for this, leading to incorrect results for inputs like `' pythonzabc '`. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
