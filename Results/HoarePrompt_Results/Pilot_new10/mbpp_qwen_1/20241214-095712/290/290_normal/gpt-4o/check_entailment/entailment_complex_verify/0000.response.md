Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` checks if the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters contains the letter 'z'. However, this does not align with the problem description, which requires 'z' to be present in the string except at the start and end of the word. The function currently returns `True` if 'z' is found anywhere in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which violates the requirement that 'z' should not be at the start or end of the word. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be corrected to properly implement the given requirements.
