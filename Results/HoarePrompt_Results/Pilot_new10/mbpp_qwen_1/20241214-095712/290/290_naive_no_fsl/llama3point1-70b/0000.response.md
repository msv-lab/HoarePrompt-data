Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last characters) for each word in the input string. Here's why:

1. The function splits the input string into words using `split()`.
2. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character contains 'z'.
3. If such a condition is met for any word, the function returns `True`.
4. If no word meets the condition after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

Given these steps, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description for any input string. There are no potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements since it correctly handles the conditions specified.
