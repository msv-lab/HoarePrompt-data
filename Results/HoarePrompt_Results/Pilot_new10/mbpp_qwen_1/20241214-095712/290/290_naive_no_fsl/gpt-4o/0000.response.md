Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where 'z' appears in the middle of the string but is immediately preceded or followed by whitespace characters. For example, consider the input `' pythonzabc '`:

- The string has 'z' in the middle, but it is not at the start or end of the word since there is a space before and after 'z'.
- According to the problem description, this should return `False`, but the current implementation would incorrectly return `True`.

To fix this, you would need to adjust the logic to ensure 'z' is not at the start or end of a word, which typically involves checking for non-whitespace characters around 'z'.
