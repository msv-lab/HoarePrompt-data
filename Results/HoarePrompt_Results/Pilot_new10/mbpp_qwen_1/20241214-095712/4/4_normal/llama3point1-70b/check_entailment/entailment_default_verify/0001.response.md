Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function uses the XOR operation to find differing bits and then counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If the count is exactly 1, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given problem description, and there is no indication that the function fails in any scenario. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
