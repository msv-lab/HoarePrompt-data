Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This is achieved by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers, which sets bits to 1 wherever the corresponding bits of the input numbers differ. Counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result using `bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1')` and checking if this count is exactly 1 ensures that the numbers differ at only one bit position. This logic holds true for all potential cases of non-negative integer inputs.
