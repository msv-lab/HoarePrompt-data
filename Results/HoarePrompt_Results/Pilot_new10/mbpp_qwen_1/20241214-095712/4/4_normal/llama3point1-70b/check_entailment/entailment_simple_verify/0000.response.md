Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using a bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The provided explanation in the original assessment is correct and aligns with the behavior of the function as seen in the annotated code. There are no issues with the logic or potential edge cases based on the given problem description and the provided inputs being non-negative integers.
