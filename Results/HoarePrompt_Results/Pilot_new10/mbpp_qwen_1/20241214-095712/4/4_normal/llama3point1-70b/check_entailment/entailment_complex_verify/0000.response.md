Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two non-negative integers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if the count of '1's is exactly 1, and `False` otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, and there are no edge cases or assumptions that would render the function incorrect given valid inputs.
