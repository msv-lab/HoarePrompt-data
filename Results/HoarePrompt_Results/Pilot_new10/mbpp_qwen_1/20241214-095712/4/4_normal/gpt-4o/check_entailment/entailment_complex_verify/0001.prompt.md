You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(13, 9) == True
assert func_1(15, 8) == False
assert func_1(2, 4) == False
assert func_1(2, 3) == True
assert func_1(5, 1) == True
assert func_1(1, 5) == True

def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic used in the function is correct. Here's a brief explanation:

- `xor_result = a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. This will result in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different.
- `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if `xor_result` has exactly one bit set to 1. This works because subtracting 1 from a number that has exactly one bit set flips all the bits after that bit (including the bit itself) to 1, and then the AND operation with the original number results in 0.

Given the test cases provided:
- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because `13` in binary is `1101` and `9` is `1001`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because `15` in binary is `1111` and `8` is `1000`, their XOR is `0111` (7), which has more than one bit set.
- `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` because `2` in binary is `0010` and `4` is `0100`, their XOR is `0110` (6), which has more than one bit set.
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because `2` in binary is `0010` and `3` is `0011`, their XOR is `0001` (1), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` because `5` in binary is `0101` and `1` is `0001`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True` because `1` in binary is `0001` and `5` is `0101`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.

Since the function passes all the provided test cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(13, 9) == True
assert func_1(15, 8) == False
assert func_1(2, 4) == False
assert func_1(2, 3) == True
assert func_1(5, 1) == True
assert func_1(1, 5) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0
    #`The program returns True if xor_result is a power of 2 (i.e., xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0) and False otherwise`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, computes the XOR of `a` and `b`, and returns `True` if the result is a power of 2. If the result is not a power of 2, it returns `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
