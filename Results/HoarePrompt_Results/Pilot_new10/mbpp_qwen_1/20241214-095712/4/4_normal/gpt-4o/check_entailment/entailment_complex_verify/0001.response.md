Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly describe the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function checks if the bitwise XOR of two numbers has exactly one bit set, which is equivalent to checking if the result is a power of 2. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected, and the logic in the function is sound. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
