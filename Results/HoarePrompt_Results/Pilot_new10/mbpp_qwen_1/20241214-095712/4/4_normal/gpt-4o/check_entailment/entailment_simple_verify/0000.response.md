Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The provided function uses the XOR operation to find the differing bits and then checks if the result has exactly one bit set. The annotation correctly describes the behavior of the function, stating that it returns `True` if `xor_result` is a power of 2 (i.e., `xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`) and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
