You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(13, 9) == True
assert func_1(15, 8) == False
assert func_1(2, 4) == False
assert func_1(2, 3) == True
assert func_1(5, 1) == True
assert func_1(1, 5) == True

def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic used in the function is correct. Here's a brief explanation:

- `xor_result = a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. This will result in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different.
- `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if `xor_result` has exactly one bit set to 1. This works because subtracting 1 from a number that has exactly one bit set flips all the bits after that bit (including the bit itself) to 1, and then the AND operation with the original number results in 0.

Given the test cases provided:
- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because `13` in binary is `1101` and `9` is `1001`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because `15` in binary is `1111` and `8` is `1000`, their XOR is `0111` (7), which has more than one bit set.
- `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` because `2` in binary is `0010` and `4` is `0100`, their XOR is `0110` (6), which has more than one bit set.
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because `2` in binary is `0010` and `3` is `0011`, their XOR is `0001` (1), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` because `5` in binary is `0101` and `1` is `0001`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True` because `1` in binary is `0001` and `5` is `0101`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.

Since the function passes all the provided test cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, computes the XOR of `a` and `b`, and returns `True` if the result is a power of 2. If the result is not a power of 2, it returns `False`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
