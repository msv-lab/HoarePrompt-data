Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, computes the XOR of `a` and `b`, and returns `True` if the result is a power of 2. If the result is not a power of 2, it returns `False`.**

This summary covers the following:
- The function accepts two non-negative integers.
- It computes the XOR of the two integers.
- It checks if the result of the XOR operation is a power of 2.
- It returns `True` if the result is a power of 2.
- It returns `False` if the result is not a power of 2.

The annotations mention the condition for returning `True` as `xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`, which correctly identifies if the result is a power of 2. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the given code and annotations.
