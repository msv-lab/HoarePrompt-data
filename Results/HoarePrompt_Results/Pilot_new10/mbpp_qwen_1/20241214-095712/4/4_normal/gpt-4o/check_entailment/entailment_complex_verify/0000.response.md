Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the goal is to check whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The provided function `func_1` uses the XOR operation to identify differing bits and then checks if the result has exactly one bit set using the condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`. This condition ensures that the XOR result is a power of 2, which means only one bit is set. The annotated version clearly explains that the function returns `True` if the XOR result is a power of 2 and `False` otherwise. Given the test cases provided, all of which are correctly evaluated as per the expected behavior, the original assessment is accurate.
