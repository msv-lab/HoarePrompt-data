Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration.

The assertions provided also validate this behavior:
- For `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the odd indices are `1, 3, 5, 7` containing `1, 3, 7, 3` which are all odd, so the function returns `True`.
- For `[4, 1, 2]`, the odd index is `1` containing `1` which is odd, so the function returns `True`.
- For `[1, 2, 3]`, the odd index is `1` containing `2` which is even, so the function returns `False`.

Since the function works as expected for the given test cases and the logic appears to cover all relevant cases, the program is correct.
