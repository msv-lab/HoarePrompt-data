Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The logic iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

Given the provided test cases:
1. `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` (Correct)
2. `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` (Correct, as the only odd index is 1, which is odd)
3. `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` (Correct, as index 1 is 2, which is even)

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic appears to handle all relevant cases, the program is correct.
