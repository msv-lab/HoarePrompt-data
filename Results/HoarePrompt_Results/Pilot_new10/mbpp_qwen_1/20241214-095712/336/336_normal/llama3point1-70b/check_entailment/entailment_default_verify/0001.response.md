Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number. However, upon reviewing the code, the function actually checks if every odd index contains an even number, not an odd number. The condition `if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:` ensures that if an even number is found at an odd index, the function returns `False`. This means the function is checking for even numbers at odd indices, which is the opposite of what the problem description asks for. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
