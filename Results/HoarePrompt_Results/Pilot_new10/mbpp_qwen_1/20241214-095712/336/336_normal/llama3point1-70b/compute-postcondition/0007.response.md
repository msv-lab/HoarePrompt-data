Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `lst` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `i` is either even or the element at index `i` is odd.
   - The next value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) is either even or the element at index `i + 1` is odd.
   - If `i` is odd and the element at index `i` is even, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns None.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the list `lst` using `range(len(lst))`.

3. **Step Analysis**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `i < len(lst)` must hold true.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`).

4. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be checked if it is within the bounds of the list (`len(lst)`).
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The new condition for the next iteration is that `i + 1` should either be even or the element at index `i + 1` should be odd.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be within the bounds of the list, i.e., `i + 1 < len(lst)`.
   - This means that `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`.

Given these points, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `lst` remains a non-empty list of integers.
- `i` must be such that `i + 1` is either even or the element at index `i + 1` is odd.
- `i` must also satisfy the condition `i < len(lst) - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`lst` is a non-empty list of integers, index `i` is either even or the element at index `i` is odd, and `i + 1` is either even or the element at index `i + 1` is odd, and `i < len(lst) - 1`**.
