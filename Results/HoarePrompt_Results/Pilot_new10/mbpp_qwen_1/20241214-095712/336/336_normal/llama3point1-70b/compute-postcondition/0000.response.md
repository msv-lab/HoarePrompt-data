State before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of integers.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(len(lst)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

1. **Initialization**: The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to but does not include `len(lst)`.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(lst)`.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- The list `lst` must have at least one element. If `lst` is empty (`len(lst) == 0`), the loop will not execute because the range function would generate an empty sequence.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `lst` has at least one element.

**State after adjustment:**
State: **`lst` is a non-empty list of integers**
