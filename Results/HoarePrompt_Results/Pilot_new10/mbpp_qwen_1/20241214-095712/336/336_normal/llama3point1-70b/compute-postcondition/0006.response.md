Postcondition: ***`lst` is a non-empty list of integers, index `i` is either even or the element at index `i` is odd, and the next value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) is either even or the element at index `i + 1` is odd. If `i` is odd and the element at index `i` is even, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns None.***
