According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop increments `i` by 2 each time, starting from 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` in `lst` is an odd number.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2. Therefore, `i` should become 3. Additionally, the condition that the element at index `i` in `lst` is an odd number still needs to hold true for the next iteration.

Here is the modified state:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, and the element at index 3 in `lst` is an odd number**
