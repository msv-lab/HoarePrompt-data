Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is 5, and the element at index 5 in `lst` is an odd number. If the element at index 5 is even, the function returns False. Since the else part does not provide a specific return value, the function returns False by default when the element at index 5 is not even (which is already implied by the precondition).***
