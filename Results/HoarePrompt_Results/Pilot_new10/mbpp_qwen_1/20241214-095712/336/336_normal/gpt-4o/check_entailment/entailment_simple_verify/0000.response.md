Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly reflect that the function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
