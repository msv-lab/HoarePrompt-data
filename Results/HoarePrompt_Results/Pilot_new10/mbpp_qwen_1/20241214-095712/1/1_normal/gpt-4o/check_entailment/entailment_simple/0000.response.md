Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the task described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) as input parameters and returns a tuple containing the common elements between the two lists, sorted in ascending order.

2. **Set Intersection**: The line `common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)` uses set intersection to find elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`. The use of sets ensures that the resulting elements are unique and can be processed efficiently.

3. **Sorting and Conversion to Tuple**: The result of the set intersection is converted to a tuple using `tuple(sorted(common_elements))`. Sorting ensures that the returned elements are in ascending order, as required by the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases check different scenarios to ensure the function works as expected:
   - `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)` should return `(4, 5)`
   - `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 4, 3, 7)` should return `(3, 4)`
   - `(11, 12, 14, 13)` and `(17, 15, 14, 13)` should return `(13, 14)`

Since the program consistently finds the common elements between the two lists, sorts them, and returns them as a tuple, it correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
