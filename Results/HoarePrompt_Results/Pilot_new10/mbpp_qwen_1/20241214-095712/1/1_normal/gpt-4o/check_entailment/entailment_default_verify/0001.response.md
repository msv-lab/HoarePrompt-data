Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the common elements between two lists, sorts them, and returns them as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where either or both lists are empty by returning an empty tuple. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that indicate the function is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
