The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. The function returns a tuple containing the sorted elements from the set `common_elements`, which contains elements present in both `list1` and `list2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, find the common elements between them, convert those elements into a set, sort them, and return them as a tuple.
