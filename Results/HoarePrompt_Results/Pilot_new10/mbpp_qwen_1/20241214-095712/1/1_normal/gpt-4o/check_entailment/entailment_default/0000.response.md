Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the shared elements from the given two lists. It uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists, sorts the resulting set, and returns it as a tuple. The function handles the case where either or both lists are empty by returning an empty tuple, as mentioned in the output hints. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works correctly for the given examples. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
