Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly finds and returns the shared elements from the given two tuples. The annotated version confirms that the function processes two tuples, converts them to sets to find the intersection, and then returns the result as a tuple. This approach is valid and meets the requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
