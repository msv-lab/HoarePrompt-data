Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as input and returns a tuple containing elements that are present in both input tuples. This is achieved by converting the tuples to sets, finding their intersection using the `&` operator, and then converting the resulting set back into a tuple. Since the problem description asks for the shared elements between the two lists (which are represented as tuples in this context), the program satisfies this requirement for all possible cases where the input tuples contain elements.
