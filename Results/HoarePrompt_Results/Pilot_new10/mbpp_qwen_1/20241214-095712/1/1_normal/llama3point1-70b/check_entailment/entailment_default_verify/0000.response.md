Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly finds and returns the unique shared elements between two input tuples. The output hints confirm that the function processes the input tuples and returns the expected result as a tuple of unique common elements. Since the function behaves as intended and handles all potential cases involving tuples, the original assessment is accurate.
