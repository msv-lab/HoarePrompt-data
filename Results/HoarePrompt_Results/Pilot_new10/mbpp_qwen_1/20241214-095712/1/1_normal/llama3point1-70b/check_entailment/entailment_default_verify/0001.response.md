Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements from the given two tuples and returns them as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function accepts two tuples and returns a tuple containing the unique elements that are present in both tuples. Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases (handling tuples of any length and any hashable elements), the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
