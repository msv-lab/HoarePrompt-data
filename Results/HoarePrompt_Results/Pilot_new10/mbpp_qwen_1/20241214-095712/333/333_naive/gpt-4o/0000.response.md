Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. The function handles all the potential cases for balanced expressions involving `{`, `}`, `[`, and `]`. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness. Since no counterexample was found, the program meets the requirements for checking balanced expressions.
