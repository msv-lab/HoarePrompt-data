Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, braces, and square brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each corresponding closing bracket matches the last opened one. 

- The function iterates through each character in the expression.
- If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), it is pushed onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), it checks whether the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.
- After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and the expression is balanced. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Since the function handles all possible cases where the expression might be unbalanced, and the logic is sound, the program is correct according to the problem description.
