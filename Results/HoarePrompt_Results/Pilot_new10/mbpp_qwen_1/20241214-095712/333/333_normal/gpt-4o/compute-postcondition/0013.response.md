The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `stack`. Since the initial state does not specify what `char` is, we will consider `char` as a generic character that is added to the stack.

Given the initial state:
- `expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
- `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters.
- `matching_pairs` is a dictionary {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.

After executing `stack.append(char)`, the `stack` will have one more element than before, which is `char`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` contains its previous elements plus `char`, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
