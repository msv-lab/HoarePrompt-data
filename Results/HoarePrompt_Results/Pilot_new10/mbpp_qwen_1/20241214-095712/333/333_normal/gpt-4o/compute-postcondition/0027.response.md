The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the function's behavior. Let's break it down step-by-step to ensure we cover all potential cases and accurately summarize the functionality.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `stack = []`: Initializes an empty stack.
   - `matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}`: Defines a dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.

2. **Loop Through Each Character in `expr`**:
   - For each character `char` in `expr`:
     - If `char` is an opening bracket (`'('`, `'['`, `'{'`), it is added to the stack.
     - If `char` is a closing bracket (`')'`, `']'`, `'}'`):
       - Checks if the stack is empty (which means there is no corresponding opening bracket).
       - If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element from the stack and checks if it matches the corresponding opening bracket. If not, it returns `False`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - After the loop, the function returns `stack == []`, which checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets and were correctly matched, so it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Empty String**: If `expr` is an empty string, the stack remains empty, and the function should return `True`.
- **Mismatched Brackets**: Any mismatched brackets (e.g., `'[)'`, `'{]'`) will result in the function returning `False`.

### Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. It checks if the string is a valid sequence of nested and properly matched brackets. If the stack is empty at the end of processing the string, it means all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Functionality:
**The function accepts a string `expr` and returns `True` if `expr` is a valid sequence of nested and properly matched parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
