Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, `char` is added to `stack`. Otherwise, the function returns False if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket according to `matching_pairs`. Otherwise, the function continues without returning a value, indicating the condition was met.***
