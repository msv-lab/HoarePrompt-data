Postcondition: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. The character `char` is in the set of values of `matching_pairs`. Either the stack is still empty or the popped element from the stack is not equal to the corresponding opening bracket of `char` according to `matching_pairs`.**
