The code snippet `stack.append(char)` appends the current character `char` to the list `stack`. Given that `char` is the first character in the string `expr` and the first character in `expr` is in the `matching_pairs.values()` set, this means `char` is one of the closing characters: `)`, `]`, or `}`.

The initial state includes:
- `expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
- `stack` is an empty list `[]`.
- `matching_pairs` is a dictionary `{')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}`.

Since `char` is the first character in `expr` and is also a key in `matching_pairs`, it must be one of `)`, `]`, or `}`. However, without knowing the exact character, we can still proceed with the general logic that `char` is appended to the stack.

After executing `stack.append(char)`, the stack will contain the first character of `expr`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is ['char'], `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
