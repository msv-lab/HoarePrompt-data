Postcondition: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters. If the top element of `stack` matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char`, `stack` remains unchanged. If `char` is found in `matching_pairs.values()` and the top element of `stack` does not match the corresponding opening bracket, the function returns False. Otherwise, `stack` contains the original elements plus one additional element (the character `char`).**
