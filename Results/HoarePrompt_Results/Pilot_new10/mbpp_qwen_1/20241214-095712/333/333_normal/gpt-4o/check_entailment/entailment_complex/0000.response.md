Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks if a given expression containing parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}` is balanced. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: A stack is initialized to keep track of opening brackets.
2. **Matching Pairs**: A dictionary `matching_pairs` is used to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.
3. **Iteration**: The function iterates through each character in the input string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`), the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition fails, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack indicates that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, thus making the expression balanced.

The program handles all potential cases as specified:
- It correctly identifies balanced expressions like `'{()}[{}]'` and `'{()}[{}][]({})'`.
- It correctly identifies unbalanced expressions like `'{()}[{]'`.

Therefore, the program accurately meets the requirements of the problem description.
