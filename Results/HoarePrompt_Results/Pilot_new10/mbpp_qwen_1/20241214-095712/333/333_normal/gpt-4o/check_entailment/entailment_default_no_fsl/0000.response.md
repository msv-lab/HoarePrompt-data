Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if the given expression is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket matches the last unmatched opening bracket. The test cases provided in the problem description cover various scenarios, including nested and sequential pairs of brackets, and the function handles them correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the hints that the code is not handling, so the function appears to be correct for every potential case described.
