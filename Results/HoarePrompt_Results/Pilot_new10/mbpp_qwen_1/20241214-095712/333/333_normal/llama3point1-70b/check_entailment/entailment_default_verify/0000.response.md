Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression with parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced. The explanation and the output hints align with the function's behavior. The function uses a stack to match opening and closing brackets and returns `True` if the expression is balanced (i.e., the stack is empty at the end) and `False` otherwise. This implementation covers all necessary cases as described in the problem statement and output hints.
