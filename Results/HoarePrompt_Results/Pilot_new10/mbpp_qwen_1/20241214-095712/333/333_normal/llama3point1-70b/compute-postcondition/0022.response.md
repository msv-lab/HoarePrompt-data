Postcondition: ***`expression` must contain at least one character, `stack` is either empty or contains the most recent opening bracket. If the top element of `stack` does not match the corresponding closing bracket for `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues execution with `stack` updated accordingly.***
