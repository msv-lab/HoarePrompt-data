Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks if a given expression containing parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization**: A stack is initialized to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.
2. **Bracket Matching**: As the function iterates through each character in the expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`), it checks whether the stack is empty or the top of the stack (an opening bracket) does not match the corresponding closing bracket. If either condition is true, the function immediately returns `False`.
3. **Final Check**: After the loop completes, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets and were properly matched; otherwise, there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

Given this logic, the function correctly identifies if the input expression is balanced. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
