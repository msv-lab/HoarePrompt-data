The code `stack.append(char)` appends the current character `char` to the list `stack`. Since `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary, its value is relevant, but the specific value does not affect the output state beyond knowing it's part of the brackets dictionary. The `expression` is unaffected.

Output State: **`stack` contains `[char]`, `expression` must contain at least one character, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']',}, the current character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary**
