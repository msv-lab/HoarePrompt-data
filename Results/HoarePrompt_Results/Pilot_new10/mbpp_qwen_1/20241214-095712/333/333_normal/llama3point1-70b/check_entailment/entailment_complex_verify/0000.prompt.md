You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, braces, and square brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each corresponding closing bracket matches the last opened one. 

- The function iterates through each character in the expression.
- If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), it is pushed onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), it checks whether the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.
- After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and the expression is balanced. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Since the function handles all possible cases where the expression might be unbalanced, and the logic is sound, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}').
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is empty or contains a sequence of opening brackets that correspond to the correct order of closing brackets, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}. If the loop completes without returning False, the `expression` is correctly matched with no unmatched opening or closing brackets, and `stack` will be empty. Otherwise, if the loop returns False, the `expression` is incorrectly matched, and `stack` will contain unmatched opening brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the `stack` is empty, indicating that the `expression` is correctly matched with no unmatched opening or closing brackets; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` containing only parentheses (`(`, `)`), square brackets (`[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) and returns `True` if the expression has correctly matched opening and closing brackets, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are correctly matched; otherwise, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, resulting in a return value of `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
