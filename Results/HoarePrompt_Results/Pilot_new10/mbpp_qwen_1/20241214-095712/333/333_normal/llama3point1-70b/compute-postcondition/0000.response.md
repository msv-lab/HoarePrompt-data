The code initializes an empty list called `stack`. The initial state of `expression` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, but no operations are performed on it in this snippet. Therefore, the value of `expression` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'); `stack` is an empty list.**
