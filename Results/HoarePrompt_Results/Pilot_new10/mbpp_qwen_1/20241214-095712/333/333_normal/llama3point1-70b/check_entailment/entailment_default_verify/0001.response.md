Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, braces, and square brackets using a stack. The function handles all potential cases where the expression is balanced or unbalanced as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the function processes strings containing only the specified types of brackets and returns `True` if they are correctly matched, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the function's correctness is accurate.
