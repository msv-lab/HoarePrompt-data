Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` accurately checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, braces, and square brackets. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function properly uses a stack to match opening and closing brackets. The function correctly returns `False` if there is a mismatch or if there are unmatched opening brackets left in the stack after processing the entire expression. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
