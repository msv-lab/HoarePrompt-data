Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using `set`, ensuring only unique numbers are considered. It then checks if there are at least two unique numbers before sorting and returning the second element of the sorted list. This approach handles all cases where there are fewer than two unique numbers by returning `None`. The function works for any list of numbers, including edge cases such as empty lists, lists with all elements the same, and lists with negative numbers.
