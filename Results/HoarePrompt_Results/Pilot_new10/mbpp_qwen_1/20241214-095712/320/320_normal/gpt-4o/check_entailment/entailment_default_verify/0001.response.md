Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the input list will always contain at least two distinct integers. However, the problem description does not specify this constraint. The function should handle cases where the list may contain fewer than two distinct integers without returning `None`. Specifically, the function should return `None` if the list has fewer than two elements, as the problem description does not guarantee the presence of at least two distinct integers. The provided test cases do not cover the edge case of an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, which would also result in `None` being returned. Therefore, the function does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
