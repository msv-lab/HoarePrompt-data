Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates and then sorting the unique elements. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program at different points and confirms that the function behaves as expected. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles all specified cases, including edge cases like empty lists or lists with identical elements.
