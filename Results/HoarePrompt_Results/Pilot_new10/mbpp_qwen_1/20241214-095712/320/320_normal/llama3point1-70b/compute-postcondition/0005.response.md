The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. The function can either return `None` or the second smallest element from the list `unique_nums`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nums` of integers with at least two distinct elements and return either `None` or the second smallest element from the list.
