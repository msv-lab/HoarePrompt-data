Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly states that the function `func_1` returns the maximum value among the `(n-1)`th element of each row in the matrix. This aligns with the problem description which asks for the maximum of the n'th column. Since the annotations and the code implementation match the problem requirements and there are no issues with the logic or edge cases handled, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
