Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where `n` might be out of bounds for some rows. Specifically, if the column index `n` is greater than or equal to the length of a row, the function will raise an `IndexError`. Since the problem description does not mention this behavior, the original assessment is not accurate. Therefore, the function is not fully correct based on the given problem description and output hints.
