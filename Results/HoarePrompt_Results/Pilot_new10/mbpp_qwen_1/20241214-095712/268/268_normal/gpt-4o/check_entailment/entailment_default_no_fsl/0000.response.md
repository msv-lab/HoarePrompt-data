Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1`. It extracts the nth column from the given matrix using list comprehension and then finds the maximum value in that column. The assertions provided cover several valid cases, including different values in the columns and different lengths for the rows (which the code inherently handles without issues). Since the code works correctly for the given examples and the problem description, and no edge cases or out-of-bound scenarios are mentioned as failing in the hints, the code appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
