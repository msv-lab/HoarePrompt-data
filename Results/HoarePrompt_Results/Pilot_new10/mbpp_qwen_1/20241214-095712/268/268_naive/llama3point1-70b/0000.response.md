Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the specified column (adjusting for zero-indexing by using `n - 1`) and applies the `max` function to find the maximum value. This approach works for any valid matrix and column index `n`, provided `n` is within the bounds of the matrix columns. There are no edge cases or special conditions in the problem description that this function fails to handle.
