Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. It uses the `zip(*tuples)` function to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position and sum the values. Then, it divides the sum by the number of tuples to get the average for each position. This approach works for any list of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
