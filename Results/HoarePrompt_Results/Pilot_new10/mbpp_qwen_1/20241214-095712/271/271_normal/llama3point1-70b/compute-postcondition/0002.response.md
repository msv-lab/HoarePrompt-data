Let's analyze the given annotated code and the return postconditions step by step:

1. **Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts one parameter, `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing numerical values (integers or floats).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function uses the `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, effectively zipping the elements at the same index across all tuples.
   - It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each zipped element.
   - For each zipped element, it calculates the sum and divides it by the length of `tuples` to find the average.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a list of values, where each value is the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the list `tuples`.

4. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - The code assumes that `tuples` is not empty. If `tuples` is empty, the function will still run without errors but will return an empty list. This is covered by the return postconditions.
   - There is no explicit handling for non-numerical values within the tuples, which could lead to errors during the summation process. However, the annotations and the return postconditions do not mention such cases explicitly.

5. **Functionality Summary**:
   - The function processes a list of tuples containing numerical values.
   - It computes the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples.
   - It returns a list of these averages.
   - If `tuples` is empty, it returns an empty list.

Given the above analysis, the function's functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples containing numerical values and returns a list of the averages of the corresponding elements across all tuples. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list.**
