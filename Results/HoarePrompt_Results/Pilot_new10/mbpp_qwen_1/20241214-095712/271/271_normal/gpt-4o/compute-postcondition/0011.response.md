The code creates a new list `elements_at_position` by extracting the element at index `(i + 1)` from each tuple in the list `tuples`. This means that `elements_at_position` will contain elements from the specified index of each tuple in `tuples`. The other variables (`avg`, `averages`, `tuples`, `i`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `elements_at_position` is assigned the value `[t[i] for t in tuples]`. This creates a new list where each element is the `(i + 1)`-th element of each tuple in `tuples`.

2. The values of `avg`, `averages`, `tuples`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`elements_at_position` is a list of elements at index (i + 1) from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`; `averages` is a list containing the value `avg`; `tuples` retain their original values; `i` is `i + 1`.**
