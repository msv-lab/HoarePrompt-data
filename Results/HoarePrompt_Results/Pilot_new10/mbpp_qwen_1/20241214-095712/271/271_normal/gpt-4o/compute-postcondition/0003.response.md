The code creates a list comprehension that extracts elements from a list of tuples at a specific index `i`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i` or the contents of `tuples`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the resulting list. We only know that `num_elements` must be greater than 0, which means there is at least one tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`num_elements` must be greater than 0; `elements_at_position` is a list of elements extracted from the tuples at index `i`**
