The code calculates the new value of `avg` by taking the sum of `elements_at_position` and dividing it by the length of `tuples`. This calculation updates the value of `avg`, but the previous value of `avg` and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`elements_at_position` is a list of elements at index (i + 1) from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`; `averages` is a list containing the value `avg`; `tuples` retain their original values; `i` is `i + 1`; `avg` is updated to the new calculated value**
