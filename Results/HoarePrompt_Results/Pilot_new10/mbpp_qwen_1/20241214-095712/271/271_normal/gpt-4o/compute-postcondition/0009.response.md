The code appends the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The value of `avg` is already defined as the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. Since `averages` is a new list that gets this average value appended, the value of `tuples` and `i` remains unchanged, and the list `elements_at_position` is also unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `elements_at_position` is a list created by extracting the element at index `i` from each tuple in the list `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the value `avg`, `tuples` and `i` retain their original values.

Output State: **`elements_at_position` is a list created by extracting the element at index `i` from each tuple in the list `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the value `avg`, `tuples` and `i` retain their original values.**
