Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter, `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numeric values (integers or floats). This matches the problem description.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The function determines the number of elements (`num_elements`) in the first tuple using `len(tuples[0])`. This is consistent with the problem description, which requires computing the average for each position across all tuples.
   - It then initializes an empty list `averages` to store the computed averages.
   - A `for` loop iterates over each position in the tuples. For each position, it collects all values at that position into the list `elements_at_position`.
   - It calculates the average of these collected values and appends the result to the `averages` list.
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the `averages` list, which contains the averages for each position across all tuples.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the input list is empty or contains tuples of varying lengths by simply returning an empty list. This is in line with the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
     - All tuples have the same length.
     - Tuples have mixed values (positive, negative, integers, floats).
     - Different numbers of tuples (three and four tuples).

Given that the function correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.
