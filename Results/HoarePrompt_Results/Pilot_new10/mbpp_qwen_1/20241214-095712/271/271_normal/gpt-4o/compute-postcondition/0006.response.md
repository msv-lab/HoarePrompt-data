Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num_elements` must be greater than 0.
   - `elements_at_position` is a list of elements extracted from the tuples at index `i`.
   - `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `elements_at_position`.
   - `averages` is a list containing `avg`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(num_elements):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(num_elements)`.
   - At the end of each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `num_elements`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the number of the current iteration.
   - To continue the loop, `i` needs to be less than `num_elements`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1` for the next iteration.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `num_elements` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `elements_at_position` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (i.e., `i + 1`).
   - `avg` will be recalculated for the new `elements_at_position`.
   - `averages` will be updated with the new `avg`.

6. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `num_elements` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.
   - `elements_at_position` is now for the position `i + 1`.
   - `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `elements_at_position`.
   - `averages` contains the updated average.

**State:**
State: **`num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements extracted from the tuples at index `i + 1`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `elements_at_position`, `averages` is a list containing `avg`**
