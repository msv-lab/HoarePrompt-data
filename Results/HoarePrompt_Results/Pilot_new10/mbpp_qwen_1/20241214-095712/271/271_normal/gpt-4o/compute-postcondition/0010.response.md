According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `num_elements`, meaning `i` must be less than `num_elements` for the loop to continue.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `elements_at_position` is a list created by extracting the element at index `i` from each tuple in the list `tuples`.
- `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.
- `averages` is a list containing the value `avg`.
- `tuples` and `i` retain their original values.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `num_elements`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`, and it must still satisfy the condition `i < num_elements`.

State: **`elements_at_position` is a list created by extracting the element at index (i + 1) from each tuple in the list `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the value `avg`, `tuples` retain their original values, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `num_elements`.**
