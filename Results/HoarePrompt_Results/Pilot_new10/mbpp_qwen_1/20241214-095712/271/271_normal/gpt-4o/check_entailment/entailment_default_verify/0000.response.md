Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. However, the function does not handle cases where the input tuples have varying lengths. According to the output hints, the function should return an empty list if the input list is empty or if the tuples have varying lengths. The provided test cases do not cover these edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate because the function does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement and output hints.
