Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. Given the problem description, the function iterates over the transposed version of the input using `zip(*tuples)` and computes the average for each position. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for any input that meets the following criteria:
- The input is a list of tuples.
- Each tuple has the same length.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and no edge cases (like different lengths of tuples or empty inputs) were identified as problematic within the constraints of the problem description, the function is considered correct.
