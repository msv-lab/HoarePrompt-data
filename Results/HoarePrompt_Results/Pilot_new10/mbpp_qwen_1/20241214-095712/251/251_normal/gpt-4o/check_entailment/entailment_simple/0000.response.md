Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\). The function `func_1` calculates the radius \(r\) using the formula \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) and the angle \(\theta\) using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point \((x, y)\).

The assertions in the code verify the correctness of the function for different sets of input values. Since the function implements the conversion logic as specified in the problem description and the provided test cases pass, the program is correct.
