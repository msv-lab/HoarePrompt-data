The code calculates the Euclidean distance from the origin (0,0) to the point (x, y) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). This updates the value of `r`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a real number representing the x-coordinate, `y` is a real number representing the y-coordinate, `r` is the Euclidean distance \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\)**
