Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two real numbers `x` and `y` as input, which represent the rectangular coordinates. It then calculates the Euclidean distance \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle in radians \( \theta \) between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y) using the `math.sqrt` and `math.atan2` functions, respectively. The function returns these values as a tuple.

The assertions in the comments verify that the function works correctly for different sets of input values. The calculations for both the radius \( r \) and the angle \( \theta \) are accurate, and the function consistently returns the expected results.

Since the function correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for any real numbers `x` and `y`, the program is correct.
