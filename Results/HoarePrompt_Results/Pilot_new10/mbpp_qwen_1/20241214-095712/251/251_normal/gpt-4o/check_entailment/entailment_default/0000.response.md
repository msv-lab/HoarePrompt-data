Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` takes two arguments `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates, and returns the polar coordinates as a tuple `(r, theta)`. The Euclidean distance \( r \) is calculated using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and the angle \( \theta \) is calculated using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). 

The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. The program handles both positive and negative values for `x` and `y`, ensuring that it works for every potential case. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
