Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly describe the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function correctly computes the polar coordinates (radius \( r \) and angle \( \theta \)) from the given rectangular coordinates (x, y). The provided test cases pass, and the annotations accurately reflect the steps taken by the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
