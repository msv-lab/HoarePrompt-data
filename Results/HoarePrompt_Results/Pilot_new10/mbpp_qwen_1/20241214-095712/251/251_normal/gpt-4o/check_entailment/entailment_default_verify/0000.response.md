Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It calculates the radius \( r \) using the Euclidean distance formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle \( \theta \) using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which accurately handles all quadrants and edge cases. The output hints align with the functionality described in the problem statement and the assertions provided. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
