Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The annotations confirm that the function calculates the radius `r` using the Euclidean distance formula and the angle `θ` using `math.atan2`, which accounts for the correct quadrant. The provided test cases also match the expected results, validating the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
