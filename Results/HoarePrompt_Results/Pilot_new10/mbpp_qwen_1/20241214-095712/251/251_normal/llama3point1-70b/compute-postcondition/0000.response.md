`r` is assigned the value of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length `x` and `y`, which is calculated using the `math.hypot(x, y)` function. The function `math.hypot(x, y)` computes the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a real number, `y` is a real number, `r` is sqrt(x^2 + y^2)**
