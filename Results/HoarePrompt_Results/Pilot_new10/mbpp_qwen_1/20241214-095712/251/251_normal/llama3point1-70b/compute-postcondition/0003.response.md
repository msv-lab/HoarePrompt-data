The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: `r`, which is the square root of `x^2 + y^2`, and `phi`, which is the result of `math.atan2(y, x)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers `x` and `y`, and return the values `r` and `phi` where `r` is the distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and `phi` is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`.
