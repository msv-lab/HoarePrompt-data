Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The function `func_1` takes two real numbers `x` and `y` as input, which represent the rectangular coordinates. It then computes the radius `r` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, which is achieved via `math.hypot(x, y)`. Additionally, it calculates the angle `phi` between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point (x, y) using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The function returns these two values, `r` and `phi`, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for in all cases.
