#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns r which is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) and phi which is math.atan2(y, x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates. It returns the values `r` and `phi`, where `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, and `phi` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`.
