Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius \( r \) as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, and `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle \( \phi \) in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles all valid inputs correctly and there are no output hints suggesting otherwise.
