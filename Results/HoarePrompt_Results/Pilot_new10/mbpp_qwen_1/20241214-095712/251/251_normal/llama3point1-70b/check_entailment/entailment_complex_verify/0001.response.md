Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius `r`, which is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y), and `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle `φ`. The annotations confirm that the function returns the expected values `r` and `φ` for given inputs `x` and `y`. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function works for all non-zero coordinates and handles the edge case (0, 0) appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
