Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The given test cases assert the function with different sets of values, and the function passes these assertions. Since the function appears to handle the cases provided in the problem description correctly, and no other edge cases were found that the function does not handle properly, the function is considered correct.
