The function accepts three non-negative parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. It calculates the area of the triangular base using the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\) and then multiplies this area by the `length` to find the volume of a triangular prism. The function returns the calculated volume.
