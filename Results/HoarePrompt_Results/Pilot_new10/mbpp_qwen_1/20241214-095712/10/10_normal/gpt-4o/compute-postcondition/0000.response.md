`base_area` is assigned the value `0.5 * base * height`. This calculates the area of a triangle using the given base and height. The values of `base`, `height`, and `length` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`base_area` is 0.5 * `base` * `height`, `base` is non-negative, `height` is non-negative, `length` is non-negative**
