Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, which is \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The provided assertions confirm that the function works as intended for the given test cases. Since the annotated version aligns with the original assessment and there are no logical errors or issues identified, the original assessment is accurate.
