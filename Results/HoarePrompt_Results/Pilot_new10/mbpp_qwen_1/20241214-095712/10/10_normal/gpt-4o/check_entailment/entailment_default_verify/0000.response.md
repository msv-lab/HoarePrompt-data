Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, as summarized in the output hints. The function `func_1` takes three non-negative parameters (`base`, `height`, and `length`), computes the area of the triangular base, and then multiplies this area by the length to get the volume. The provided test cases match the expected results, and there are no edge cases or logical errors indicated by the output hints that suggest the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
