The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. These parameters are non-negative numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism, respectively. The function calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula `volume = base_area * length`, where `base_area` is calculated as `0.5 * base * height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the base, height, and length of a triangular prism and return the volume.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters base, height, and length, and returns the volume of a triangular prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length.**
