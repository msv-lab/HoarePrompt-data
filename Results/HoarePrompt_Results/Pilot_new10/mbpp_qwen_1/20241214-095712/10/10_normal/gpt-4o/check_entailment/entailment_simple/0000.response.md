Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism as per the problem description. The function takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. These parameters represent the base and height of the triangular base of the prism and the length of the prism, respectively. 

The function computes the area of the triangular base using the formula \( \text{base\_area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). It then multiplies this area by the length of the prism to get the volume: \( \text{volume} = \text{base\_area} \times \text{length} \).

The provided assertions test the function with different sets of values and verify that the returned volume matches the expected results. Since the function correctly implements the volume calculation formula for a triangular prism and the provided test cases pass, the function is correct according to the problem description.
