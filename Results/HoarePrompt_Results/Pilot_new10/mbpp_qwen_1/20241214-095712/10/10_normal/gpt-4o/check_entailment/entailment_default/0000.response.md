Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, and calculates the volume using the formula for the area of a triangle (0.5 * base * height) multiplied by the length. The given test cases (`assert` statements) cover different scenarios and validate the correctness of the function for those specific inputs. Since the code matches the problem description and the provided examples work as expected, the program is correct for every potential case.
