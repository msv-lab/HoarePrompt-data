Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The test cases provided in the annotations confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since the function handles the provided test cases accurately and the annotations validate the functionality, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
