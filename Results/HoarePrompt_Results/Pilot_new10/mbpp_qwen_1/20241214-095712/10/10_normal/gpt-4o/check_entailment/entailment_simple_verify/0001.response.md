Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a Python function to find the volume of a triangular prism. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The annotated version of the code clearly states that the inputs are non-negative numbers, and the assertions provided in the code confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
