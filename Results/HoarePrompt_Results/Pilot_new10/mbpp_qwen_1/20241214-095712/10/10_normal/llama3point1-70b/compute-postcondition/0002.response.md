The annotated code states that the function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base length of the triangular face, the height of the triangular face, and the length of the prism, respectively. The function then returns the value of `(b * h / 2 * l)`.

Upon reviewing the code, we can confirm that it directly computes the volume of a triangular prism using the given formula. There are no conditional statements or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that are not reflected in the code.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept three positive floats `b`, `h`, and `l`, and return the calculated volume of a triangular prism using the formula `(b * h / 2 * l)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive floats `b`, `h`, and `l`, and returns the calculated volume of a triangular prism using the formula `(b * h / 2 * l)`.**
