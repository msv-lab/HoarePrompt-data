Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The output hints confirm that the function accepts three positive floats `b`, `h`, and `l`, and returns the calculated volume. Given that the problem description matches the implemented function and the output hints align with the expected behavior, the original assessment is accurate. There are no issues with edge cases or missing logic based on the provided information.
