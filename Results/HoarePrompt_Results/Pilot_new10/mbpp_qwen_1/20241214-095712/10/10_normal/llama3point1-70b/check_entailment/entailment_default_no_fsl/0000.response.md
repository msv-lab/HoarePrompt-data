Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\), which is correct according to the problem description. Here, \(b\) is the base of the triangle, \(h\) is the height of the triangle, and \(l\) is the length of the prism. The function takes three positive float inputs and returns the calculated volume, which matches the problem description and output hints. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified from the given information that would make the program incorrect.
