You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which is correct according to the problem description. The function takes three parameters: `b` (the base of the triangle), `h` (the height of the triangle), and `l` (the length of the prism). Since the formula used in the function matches the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive float representing the base length of the triangular face, h is a positive float representing the height of the triangular face, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns (b * h / 2 * l)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive floats `b`, `h`, and `l`, and returns the calculated volume of a triangular prism using the formula `(b * h / 2 * l)`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
