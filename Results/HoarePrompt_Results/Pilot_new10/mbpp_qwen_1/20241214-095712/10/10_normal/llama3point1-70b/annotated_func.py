#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive float representing the base length of the triangular face, h is a positive float representing the height of the triangular face, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns (b * h / 2 * l)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive floats `b`, `h`, and `l`, and returns the calculated volume of a triangular prism using the formula `(b * h / 2 * l)`.
