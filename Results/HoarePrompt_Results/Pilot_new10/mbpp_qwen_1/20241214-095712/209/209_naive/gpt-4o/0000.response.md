Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist. The comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates through each sublist in the given list `lst` and returns the first element of each sublist. The function passes all the provided test cases and seems to handle the task correctly for any input list of sublists. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that the current implementation does not handle.
