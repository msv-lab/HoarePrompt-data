Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly retrieves the first element of each sublist for the given test cases. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and extract the first element. Given the problem description and the test cases provided, the function works as expected for all tested scenarios. Since there is no indication of any edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail, we can conclude that the function is correct.
