Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists and returns a new list containing the first element from each sublist. This is exactly what the problem description asks for, and the code does not miss any edge cases or fail to handle any potential inputs. The list comprehension used in the function ensures that each sublist is processed correctly, regardless of its size or contents. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case.
