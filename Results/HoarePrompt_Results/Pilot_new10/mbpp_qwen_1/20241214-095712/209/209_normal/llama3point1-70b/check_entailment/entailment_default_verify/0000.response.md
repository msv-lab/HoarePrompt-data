Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly returns the first element of each sublist in the input list `sublists`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, creating a new list with the first elements of each sublist. Since the function handles the general case correctly and there are no edge cases or invalid input scenarios mentioned that would cause it to fail, the original assessment is accurate.
