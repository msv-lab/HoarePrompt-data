Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists as input and returns a new list containing the first element from each sublist. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list `lst`. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the program is correct and always follows the problem description.
