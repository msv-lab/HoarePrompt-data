Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist as per the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the function handles the case where a sublist might be empty, returning `None` for such cases. Since the problem description does not specify handling non-list inputs or empty lists differently (it only mentions valid inputs), the function is correct based on the given requirements.
