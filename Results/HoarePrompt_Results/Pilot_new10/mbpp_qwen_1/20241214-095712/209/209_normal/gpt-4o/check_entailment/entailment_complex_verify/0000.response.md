Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list. The function handles the task as described in the problem statement and passes all provided test cases. Although the annotation mentions that if any sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`, the function itself does not include this behavior. Since the problem description does not mention handling empty sublists, the current implementation is sufficient and correct. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
