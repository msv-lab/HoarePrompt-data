Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly retrieves the first element of each sublist as demonstrated by the test cases. The annotation confirms that the function returns a list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the input list `lst`. While the annotation mentions handling empty sublists by returning `None`, it is implied that such cases are not relevant given the assumption of valid input. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is appropriate.
