Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists (`lst`) as input and returns a new list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the original list. 

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `lst` and extract the first element `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]`.
- This approach ensures that the function works for any list of sublists, including cases where sublists may be empty, as an empty sublist would result in `None` being included in the output list.

The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. `assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]`
2. `assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]`
3. `assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]`

Since the function consistently extracts the first element from each sublist without any conditions that would deviate from the problem description, the program is correct.
