Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases. However, the output hints indicate that if any sublist in `lst` is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list should contain `None`. The current implementation of the function does not account for this scenario; it will simply return the first element of the sublist or raise an `IndexError` if the sublist is empty. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the function does not handle the case where sublists are empty as specified in the output hints.
