Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. According to the problem description, the function should return the list (or one of the lists) with the maximum length in the given `list_of_lists`. However, the current implementation of the function returns two things: 

1. The maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists`.
2. The first sublist from `max_sublists` that has this maximum length.

While the first part is correct (finding the maximum length), the second part is not consistent with the problem description. The problem description asks for the list of maximum length, but the function returns only the first such list it finds. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function will only return one of them, which may not be the correct behavior if the intention is to return all such lists.

To make the program correct, the function should return either:

- All sublists with the maximum length, or
- Just one of the sublists with the maximum length (if the intention is to return just one).

Here is an example of how the function could be corrected to return all sublists with the maximum length:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_len, max_sublists
```

In this corrected version, the function returns both the maximum length and all sublists that have this maximum length, thus fully meeting the requirements of the problem description.
