The code creates a new list `max_sublists` containing all sublists from `list_of_lists` that have a length equal to `max_len`. The original `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new list `max_sublists` and retains the original values of `list_of_lists` and `max_len`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists; `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists`; `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where each sublist's length equals `max_len`**
