Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the problem description because it returns both the maximum length of the sublists and the first sublist that has this maximum length, whereas the problem description only asks for the list of maximum length (plural), not just the first one. 

To be correct, the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. Here's an example where the current implementation would fail:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10]]
```

In this case, the maximum length is 3, and there are two sublists with this length: `[3, 4, 5]` and `[6, 7, 8]`. The current implementation will only return one of them, but the problem description requires returning a list of all such sublists. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
