Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, whereas the problem description requires returning a list of all sublists that have the maximum length. For example, consider the following input:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 9]]
```

The maximum length of the sublists is 4, and there are two sublists with this length: `[6, 7, 8, 9]` and `[10, 11, 12, 9]`. However, the function will only return `[10, 11, 12, 9]` because it uses `max_sublists[0]` to return only the first sublist. Therefore, the function does not satisfy the requirement to return all sublists with the maximum length.
