Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input and returns a tuple containing two elements: the length of the longest list found in `list_of_lists` and the longest list itself.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `max_len` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest list found so far.
   - `max_list` is initialized as an empty list, which will store the longest list found.

2. **Iteration**:
   - A for loop iterates over each list (`lst`) in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each list, the program checks if its length is greater than `max_len`. If it is, then `max_len` is updated to the current list's length, and `max_list` is updated to the current list.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - After iterating through all the lists, the function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

The provided assertions test different scenarios, including cases with varying numbers of sublists and different lengths of sublists, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the program always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
