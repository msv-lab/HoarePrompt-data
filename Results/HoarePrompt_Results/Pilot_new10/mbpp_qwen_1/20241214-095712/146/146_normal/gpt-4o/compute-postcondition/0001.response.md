The code assigns an empty list to the variable `max_list`. This does not affect the value of `max_len` or the contents of `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list; `max_len` is 0; `max_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list; `max_len` is 0; `max_list` is an empty list**
