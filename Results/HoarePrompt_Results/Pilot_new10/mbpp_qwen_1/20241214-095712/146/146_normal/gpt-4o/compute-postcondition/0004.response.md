The code sets `max_len` to the length of a list `lst` within `list_of_lists`. Since `lst` is one of the lists within `list_of_lists` and its length is greater than `max_len`, `max_len` will now be updated to this length. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, each list within `list_of_lists` has a length greater than `max_len`; `max_len` is the length of the list `lst` within `list_of_lists`.**
