Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the longest list and its length. It returns the length of the longest list (`max_len`) and the longest list itself (`max_list`). The provided test cases confirm that the function works correctly for the given examples. There is no indication in the problem description or the hints that the function fails to meet the requirements for any potential case. Therefore, the function is correct.
