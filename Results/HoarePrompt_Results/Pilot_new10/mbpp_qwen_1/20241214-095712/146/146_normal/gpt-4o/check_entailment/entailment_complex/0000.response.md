Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input and returns a tuple containing two elements:
   - The length of the longest list within `list_of_lists`.
   - The longest list itself.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
   - It then iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`. For each list, it checks if the current list's length is greater than `max_len`. If so, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to the current list.
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple `(max_len, max_list)`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided test different cases:
     - A list with one-element lists.
     - A list with multi-element lists.
     - A list with a single multi-element list.
   - The function passes all these tests, confirming that it correctly identifies the longest list and its length.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like empty lists within `list_of_lists` because the comparison `len(lst) > max_len` will only update `max_len` and `max_list` when a longer list is found. If no lists are longer than the initial value of `max_len` (which is 0), `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

Given that the function adheres to the problem description and passes all provided test cases, the program is correct.
