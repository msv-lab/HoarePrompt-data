Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length in a list of lists. It iterates through each list, compares their lengths, and keeps track of the longest list found. After checking all lists, it returns the length of the longest list along with the list itself. This logic is sound and covers all potential cases without any issues. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described.
