Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length from a list of lists. It first determines the maximum length among all sublists and then returns a tuple containing this maximum length and the first sublist that matches this length. This implementation handles all edge cases, such as an empty list of lists, a list with sublists of varying lengths, and a list where multiple sublists have the same maximum length. Since the function meets the requirements for all potential cases, it is correct.
