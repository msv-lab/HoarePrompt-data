Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length from a list of lists. The function iterates through each list, updates the maximum length and corresponding list whenever a longer list is found. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as lists with varying lengths and a single-element list. The function handles these cases correctly and returns the expected results. Since no specific edge cases or additional potential issues were identified, the function appears to be correct for all described cases.
