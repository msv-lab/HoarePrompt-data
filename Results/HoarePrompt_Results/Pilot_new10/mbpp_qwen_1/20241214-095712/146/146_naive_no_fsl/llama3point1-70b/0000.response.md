Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program returns only the first sublist with the maximum length instead of returning all sublists with the maximum length. For example, consider the following input:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11]]
```

The maximum length of any sublist is 4, and there is one sublist with this length: `[6, 7, 8, 9]`. However, the program will return `(4, [1, 2])` because it only returns the first sublist with the maximum length. According to the problem description, the function should return all sublists with the maximum length, which in this case would be `[6, 7, 8, 9]`.

To fix this, the program should modify the return statement to include all sublists with the maximum length:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```

With this modification, the function will return the correct result for all potential cases.
