Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which matches the problem description. All the provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected:

- For the substring `'python'` in the main string `'python programming, python language'`, it correctly returns `('python', 0, 6)`.
- For the substring `'programming'` in the main string `'python programming,programming language'`, it correctly returns `('programming', 7, 18)`.
- For the substring `'language'` in the main string `'python programming,programming language'`, it correctly returns `('language', 31, 39)`.
- For the substring `'python'` in the main string `'c++ programming, c++ language'`, it correctly returns `None`.

Since the function handles all given cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
