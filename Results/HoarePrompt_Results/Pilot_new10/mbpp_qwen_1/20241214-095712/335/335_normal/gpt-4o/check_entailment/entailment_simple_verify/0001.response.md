Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substring correctly. However, the annotated version shows that the function only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its start and end positions. The function does not handle subsequent occurrences, which is correct according to the problem description. The problem description asks for the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string, and it does not specify handling overlapping occurrences. Therefore, the original assessment was not accurate for this particular implementation.
