Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. It returns `None` when the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
