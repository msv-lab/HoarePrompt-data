Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substring correctly. However, the annotated version of the code shows that the function `func_1` only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its start and end positions. The provided test cases do not demonstrate the function handling overlapping occurrences, and the annotated code does not indicate any mechanism for finding subsequent occurrences. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as the current implementation does not handle overlapping occurrences.
