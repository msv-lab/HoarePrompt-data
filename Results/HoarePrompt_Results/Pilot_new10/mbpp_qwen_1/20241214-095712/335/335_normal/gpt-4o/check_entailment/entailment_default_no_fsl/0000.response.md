Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where multiple occurrences of the substring exist in the main string. According to the problem description, the function should return the first occurrence of the substring along with its starting and ending positions. However, the assertions only test for single occurrences and the absence of a substring. 

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
assert func_1('python python', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
```

The function should return `('python', 0, 6)` because the first occurrence of 'python' starts at index 0. However, the current implementation will return `('python', 0, 6)` which is correct for this specific case, but it does not guarantee that it will always return the first occurrence if there are multiple matches. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the function works correctly for every potential case based solely on the provided assertions.
