Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases:

1. **Finding Substring Occurrence**: The function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence or absence of the substring within the main string.
2. **Return Values**:
   - If the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring itself, its starting position, and its ending position.
   - If the substring is not found, the function correctly returns `None`.

The assertions provided in the comments verify the behavior of the function in different scenarios:
- The first assertion checks a case where the substring `'python'` is present in the main string.
- The second and third assertions check other instances where the substring is present and the expected positions are calculated correctly.
- The fourth assertion checks a case where the substring `'python'` is not present in the main string `'c++ programming, c++ language'`, and the function returns `None` as expected.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases as required.
