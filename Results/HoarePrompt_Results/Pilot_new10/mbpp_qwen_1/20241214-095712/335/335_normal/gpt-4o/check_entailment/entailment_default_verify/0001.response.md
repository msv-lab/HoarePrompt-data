Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the provided function `func_1` does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substring. The function only finds the first occurrence and stops. The output hints confirm that the function returns a single tuple for each substring occurrence, which is not aligned with the requirement to return all occurrences, including overlapping ones. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the function needs to be modified to handle overlapping occurrences as described.
