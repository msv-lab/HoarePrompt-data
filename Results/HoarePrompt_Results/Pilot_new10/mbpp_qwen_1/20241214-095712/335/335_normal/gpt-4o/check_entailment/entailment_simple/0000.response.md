Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`. It finds the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string` and returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

2. **Assertions**:
   - The first assertion checks for a simple case where the substring "python" is present in the main string, and the function returns the correct substring along with its starting and ending positions.
   - The second assertion tests a case where the substring "programming" is present, and again, the function returns the correct values.
   - The third assertion checks another occurrence of the substring "language" in the main string, and the function correctly returns the expected values.
   - The fourth assertion verifies that when the substring "python" is not present in the main string, the function correctly returns `None`.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring within the main string.
   - If the substring is not found (`start_pos == -1`), the function immediately returns `None`.
   - If the substring is found, the function calculates the end position as `start_pos + len(sub_string)` and returns a tuple containing the substring, the start position, and the end position.

Since the program passes all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
