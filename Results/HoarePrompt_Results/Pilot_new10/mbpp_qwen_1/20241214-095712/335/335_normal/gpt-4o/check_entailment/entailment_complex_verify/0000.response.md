Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. The annotations clearly show that the function handles both the case where the substring is found and where it is not found, returning `None` appropriately. The provided test cases in the assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
