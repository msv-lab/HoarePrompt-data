Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. However, the provided output hints indicate that the function should return the ending position of the substring (`end_pos`) in the tuple, but the function currently returns `start_pos + len(sub_string)` instead of `end_pos`. This means the function is returning the position just after the substring, not the end position of the substring itself. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program needs to be corrected to return the correct end position.
