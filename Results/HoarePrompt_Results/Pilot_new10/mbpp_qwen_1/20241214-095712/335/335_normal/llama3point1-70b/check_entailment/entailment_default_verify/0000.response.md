Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of a substring within a string and returns `None` if there is no match. However, the function only returns the substring itself, along with its start and end positions, rather than just the start and end indices as described in the problem description. The function should return only the start and end indices if the substring is found, and `None` if it is not found. The current implementation returns the substring, which does not align with the expected output as per the problem description and output hints. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
