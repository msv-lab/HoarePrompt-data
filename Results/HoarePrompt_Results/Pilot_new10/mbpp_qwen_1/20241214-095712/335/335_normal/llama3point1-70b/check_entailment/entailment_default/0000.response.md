Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function returns a tuple containing the substring itself, its starting index, and its ending index. However, the problem description asks for the occurrence and position of the substrings, which typically means returning only the indices or positions without including the substring itself in the result. The function incorrectly includes the substring in the returned tuple, which does not align with the problem description. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
