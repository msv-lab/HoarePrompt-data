Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. The function returns `None` if the substring is not found in the string, and it returns the substring along with its start and end positions if found. The annotations clearly indicate that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios, making the original assessment accurate.
