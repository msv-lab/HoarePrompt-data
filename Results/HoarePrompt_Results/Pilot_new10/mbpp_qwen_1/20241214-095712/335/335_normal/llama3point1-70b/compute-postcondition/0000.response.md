The `find` method is called on the `string` variable to find the index of the first occurrence of the `substring`. This method returns the index if the substring is found, otherwise it returns -1. Since the initial state does not specify whether the `substring` is actually present in `string`, we need to consider both possibilities.

Output State: **`string` is a string and `substring` is a non-empty string; `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` if it exists, otherwise -1.**
