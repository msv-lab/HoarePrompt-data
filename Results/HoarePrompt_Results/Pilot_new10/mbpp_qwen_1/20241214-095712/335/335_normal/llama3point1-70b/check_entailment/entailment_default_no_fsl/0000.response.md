Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code only returns the starting index and the ending index of the first occurrence of the substring. However, the problem description asks for the occurrence and position of all substrings within the string, not just the first one. Additionally, the problem description does not specify that only the first occurrence should be returned. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case. For instance, if the substring appears multiple times in the string, the function will only return the indices of the first occurrence, which is incorrect according to the problem description.
