You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions if found, and `None` otherwise. This matches the problem description perfectly. There are no edge cases or specific inputs where this function would fail based on the given implementation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string and substring is a non-empty string.
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if (start == -1) :
        return None
        #`The program returns None`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` if it exists, otherwise -1, and `start` is not equal to -1
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
    #`substring` as originally defined, `start` as the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and `end - 1` which is `start + len(substring) - 1`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
