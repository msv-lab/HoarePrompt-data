Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(string, substring)` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a given `substring` within a `string`. If the substring is found, the function should return the `substring`, its starting index (`start`), and the ending index (`end - 1`).

2. **Return None if No Match**: The program correctly checks if the substring is found using `string.find(substring)`. If `start` is `-1`, indicating that the substring is not found in the string, the function returns `None`. This satisfies the requirement to return `None` if there is no match.

3. **Return Values if Match**: If the substring is found (i.e., `start != -1`), the function correctly calculates the end index as `start + len(substring) - 1` and returns the substring along with its start and end indices.

4. **Type and Value Consistency**: The state of the program after the if block execution ensures that `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` if it exists, and otherwise `-1`. The program then calculates `end` as `start + len(substring) - 1` and returns these values, which aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all cases.
