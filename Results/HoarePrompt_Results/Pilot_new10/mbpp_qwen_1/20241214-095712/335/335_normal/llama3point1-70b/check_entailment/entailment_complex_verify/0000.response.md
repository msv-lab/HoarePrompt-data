Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly handles both cases where the substring is found and where it is not. When the substring is found, it returns the expected tuple with the start and end indices. When the substring is not found, it correctly returns `None`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for the function to return `None` if there is no match. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
