The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. `string` is a string, and `substring` is a non-empty string.

- If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`.
- If `substring` is found in `string`, the function returns a tuple containing the starting index (`start`) of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` and the ending index (`end - 1`) which is `start + len(substring) - 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `string` and a non-empty string `substring`, and return either `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`, or a tuple with the starting and ending indices of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
