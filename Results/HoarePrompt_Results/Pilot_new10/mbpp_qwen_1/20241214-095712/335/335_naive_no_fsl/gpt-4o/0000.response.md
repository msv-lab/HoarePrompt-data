Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substring correctly. For example, consider the following case:

```
assert func_1('python programming, programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
```

In this case, the function returns the first occurrence of 'programming' starting at index 7 and ending at index 18. However, the substring 'programming' also appears again starting at index 12. The function should return all occurrences of the substring along with their start and end positions. 

To fix this, the function needs to continue searching for the substring from the next character after the last found occurrence. Here is an example of how you could modify the function to handle overlapping occurrences:

```python
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    results = []
    start_pos = 0
    while True:
        start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string, start_pos)
        if start_pos == -1:
            break
        end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
        results.append((sub_string, start_pos, end_pos))
        start_pos += 1  # Move to the next character to find overlapping occurrences
    return results if results else None
```

With this modification, the function will correctly return all occurrences of the substring, including overlapping ones.
