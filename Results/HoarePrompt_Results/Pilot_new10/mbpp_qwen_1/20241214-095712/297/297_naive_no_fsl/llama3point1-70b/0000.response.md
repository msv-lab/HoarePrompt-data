Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This matches the problem description exactly. 

Given a tuple `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor, and then multiplies them using a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor. This will correctly produce a tuple of length `N` with the required products for any input tuple of length `N+1`.

Since the function behaves as expected for any valid input, there are no potential cases where the program does not meet the requirements described.
