Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of taking a tuple of numbers `(t_1,...,t_{N+1})` and returning a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the desired output. This approach handles the given test cases correctly and should work for any input tuple, as long as the tuple has at least two elements. There are no edge cases or special inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description and the provided examples.
