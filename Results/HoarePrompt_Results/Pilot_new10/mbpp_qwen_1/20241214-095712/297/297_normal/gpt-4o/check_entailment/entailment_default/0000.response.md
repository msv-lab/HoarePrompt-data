Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. For tuples with fewer than 2 elements, it returns an empty tuple, which matches the problem description. All the provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
