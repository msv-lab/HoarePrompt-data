#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of integers or floats with a length of N+1, where N is a positive integer.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `t`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` of integers or floats with a minimum length of 2 and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from `t`. For tuples with fewer than 2 elements, the function returns an empty tuple.
