Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of multiplying consecutive elements in the input tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of at least two elements by returning a tuple of products of consecutive elements and returns an empty tuple for inputs with fewer than two elements. The code and the problem description align, and there are no edge cases or special inputs mentioned that would cause the function to fail based on the given examples and assumptions about valid inputs.
