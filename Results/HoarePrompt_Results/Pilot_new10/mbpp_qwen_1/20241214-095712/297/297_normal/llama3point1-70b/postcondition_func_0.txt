The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of integers `numbers` of length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer, and returns a tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element in `numbers` and the element that follows it in a right-shifted version of the tuple. This means that the first element of the returned tuple will be the product of the last element of `numbers` and the second-to-last element, and so on.
