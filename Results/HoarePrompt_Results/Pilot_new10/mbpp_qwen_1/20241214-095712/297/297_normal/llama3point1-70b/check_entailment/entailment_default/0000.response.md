Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the required functionality correctly. Given a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function `func_1` returns a tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element in `numbers` and the element that follows it in a right-shifted version of the tuple. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to achieve this:

```python
return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))
```

This line of code pairs each element `a` from the original tuple with its successor `b` (using `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`) and computes the product `a * b`. The result is then converted into a tuple. 

For any input tuple of length `N+1`, the function correctly handles the multiplication as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case.
