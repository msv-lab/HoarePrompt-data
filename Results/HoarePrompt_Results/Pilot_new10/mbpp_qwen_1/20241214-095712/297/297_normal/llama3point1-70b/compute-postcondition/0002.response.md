Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of integers `numbers` of length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer, and returns a tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element in `numbers` and the element that follows it in a right-shifted version of the tuple. This means that the first element of the returned tuple will be the product of the last element of `numbers` and the second-to-last element, and so on.**

This summary covers the functionality of the function and includes the potential edge case where the input tuple has only one element, in which case the output tuple would be empty. However, given the nature of the `zip` function used in the code, the function would still process the tuple correctly as described.
