Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple where each element is the product of the current element and the next element in the tuple (right-shifted). The function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor, and then applies a generator expression to compute the products. This approach correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description, including edge cases like tuples of length 2 or greater. The function does not produce incorrect outputs based on the given problem description and output hints.
