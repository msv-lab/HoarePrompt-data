Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the explanation provided in the original assessment accurately reflect the behavior of the program. The function `func_1` correctly pairs each element of the input tuple with its successor using `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, and then computes the product of these pairs using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor. This ensures that the output tuple has the correct length and contains the correct products as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
