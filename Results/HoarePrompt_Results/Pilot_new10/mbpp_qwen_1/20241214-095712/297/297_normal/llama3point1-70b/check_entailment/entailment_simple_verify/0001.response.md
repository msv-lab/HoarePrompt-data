Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a tuple of integers of length \(N+1\) and returns a tuple of length \(N\) where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly implements the required behavior for any valid input tuple of length \(N+1\).
