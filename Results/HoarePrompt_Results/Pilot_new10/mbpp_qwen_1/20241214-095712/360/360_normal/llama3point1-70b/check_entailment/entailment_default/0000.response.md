Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of integers and returns the sublist with the highest sum of its elements. If multiple sublists have the same highest sum, it returns one of them. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument ensures that the sublist with the maximum sum is selected. This matches the problem description and handles all potential cases, including those where multiple sublists have the same maximum sum. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
