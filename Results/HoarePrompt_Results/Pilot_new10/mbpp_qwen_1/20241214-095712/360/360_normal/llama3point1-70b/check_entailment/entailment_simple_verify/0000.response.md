Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment are both accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds and returns the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The annotation clearly states that the program returns a list from `lists` which has the maximum sum when the elements of each sublist are added together, aligning with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
