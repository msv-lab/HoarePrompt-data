Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of its elements by using the `max` function with `key=sum`. Given the problem description and the assumptions about valid input, the function will work as intended for all valid cases. The annotation accurately reflects the behavior of the function, confirming that the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
