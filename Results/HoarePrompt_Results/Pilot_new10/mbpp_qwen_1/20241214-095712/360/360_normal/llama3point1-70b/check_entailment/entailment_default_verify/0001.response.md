Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the list within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, returning the sublist with the highest sum. The function uses the `max` function with `key=sum`, which ensures that the comparison is based on the sum of the elements in each sublist. Since the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases that the function should handle beyond what is already covered, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
