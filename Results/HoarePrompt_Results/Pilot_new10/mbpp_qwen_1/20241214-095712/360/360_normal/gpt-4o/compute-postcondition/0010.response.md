The code `max_sum = current_sum` assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. This means that `max_sum` is now equal to whatever the previous value of `current_sum` was. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists, `current_sum` is the sum of one of its sublists, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`**
