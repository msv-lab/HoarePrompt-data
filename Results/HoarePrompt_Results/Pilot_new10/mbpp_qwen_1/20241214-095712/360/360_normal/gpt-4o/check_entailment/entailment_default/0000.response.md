Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. If the input list of lists is empty, the function returns an empty list, which aligns with the problem description. The examples provided also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case mentioned.
