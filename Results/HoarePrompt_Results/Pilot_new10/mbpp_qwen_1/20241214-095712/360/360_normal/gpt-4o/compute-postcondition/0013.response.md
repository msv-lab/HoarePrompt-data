According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `list_of_lists`. The loop will continue as long as `list_of_lists` has at least two sublists.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists.
- `current_sum` is the sum of one of its sublists.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to the sublist corresponding to `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `list_of_lists` must still have at least two sublists. Since the condition for continuing the loop is only that `list_of_lists` has at least two sublists, and there is no indication that this condition changes within the loop (the loop updates `max_sum` and `max_list` but does not alter the number of sublists in `list_of_lists`), we can conclude that `list_of_lists` still has at least two sublists at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists.
- `current_sum` is the sum of one of its sublists.
- `max_sum` and `max_list` are either unchanged or updated based on the current sublist.

State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists, `current_sum` is the sum of one of its sublists, `max_sum` and `max_list` are either unchanged or updated based on the current sublist**
