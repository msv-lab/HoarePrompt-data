Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `sublist`, which iterates over each element in `list_of_lists`.
   - Other relevant variables are `max_sum` and `max_list`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop Execution:**
   - The `for` loop will execute as long as there are elements in `list_of_lists`.
   - The loop will iterate through each sublist in `list_of_lists`.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers.
   - `max_sum` is initialized to `-inf` (negative infinity).
   - `max_list` is an empty list.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - When the loop starts, `sublist` should be set to the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

- `list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist.
- `sublist` should be the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Thus, the final state adjustment required is:

**State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist, `max_sum` is -inf, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**.
