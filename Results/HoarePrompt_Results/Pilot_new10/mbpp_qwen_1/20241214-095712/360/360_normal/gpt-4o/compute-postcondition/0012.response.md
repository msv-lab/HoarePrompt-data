Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists, `current_sum` is the sum of one of its sublists. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to the sublist corresponding to `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
