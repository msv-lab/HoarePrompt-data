Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists of integers. The output hints align with the function's behavior, indicating that it handles an empty `list_of_lists` by returning an empty list. The original assessment correctly notes that the function works as expected across various scenarios, and the output hints confirm this functionality.
