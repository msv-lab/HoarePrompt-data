Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists. After executing the if-else block, `max_sum` and `max_list` are updated if `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `max_sum`. Specifically, if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is set to `current_sum` and `max_list` is set to the current sublist. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
