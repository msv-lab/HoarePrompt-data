Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The output hints also confirm that the function handles the case where `list_of_lists` is empty by returning an empty list. Since the function works as expected for the provided examples and there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that are not handled (as per the problem description and output hints), the program is correct.
