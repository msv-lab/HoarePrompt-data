Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state of the program at different points and aligns with the functionality of the function `func_1`. The function correctly iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with a single sublist and multiple sublists with different sums. There are no apparent logical flaws or issues with the handling of input types or edge cases (as per the assumption that valid input will always be provided). Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
