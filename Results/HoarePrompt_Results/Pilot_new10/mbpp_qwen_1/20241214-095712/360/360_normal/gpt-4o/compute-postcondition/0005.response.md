The code updates `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. The previous value of `max_sum` was greater than `previous_max_sum`, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first sublist (`sublist`). After the assignment, `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is now the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`**
