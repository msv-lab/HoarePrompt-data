The code assigns the value of `sublist` to the variable `max_list`. However, the initial state does not specify what `sublist` is. We know that `current_sum` is the sum of one of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`. Since `sublist` could be any sublist in `list_of_lists`, we will denote it as such.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists, `current_sum` is the sum of one of its sublists, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`**
