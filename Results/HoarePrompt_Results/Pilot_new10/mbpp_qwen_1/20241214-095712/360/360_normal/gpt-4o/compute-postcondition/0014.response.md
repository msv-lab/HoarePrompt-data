The code `current_sum = sum(sublist)` calculates the sum of the elements in the `sublist` and assigns it to `current_sum`. This updates the value of `current_sum` but does not affect `max_sum` or `max_list` unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `max_sum` and `max_list`, we consider the general case where they might or might not be updated.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the current sublist, `max_sum` and `max_list` are either unchanged (if `current_sum` is less than `max_sum`) or updated to `current_sum` and the current sublist (if `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `max_sum`).**
