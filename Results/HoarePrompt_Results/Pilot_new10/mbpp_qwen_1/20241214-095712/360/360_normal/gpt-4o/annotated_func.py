#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists of integers.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum among all sublists, `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum.
    return max_list
    #`The program returns the sublist with the maximum sum from list_of_lists`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers, and returns the sublist with the maximum sum from `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
