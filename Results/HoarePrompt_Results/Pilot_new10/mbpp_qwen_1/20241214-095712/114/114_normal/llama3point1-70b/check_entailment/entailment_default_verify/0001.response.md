Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by using the built-in `count` method of tuples. The function returns the number of times the specified element appears in the given tuple, which aligns with the problem description and the output hints. The function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, including empty tuples and tuples with repeated elements.
