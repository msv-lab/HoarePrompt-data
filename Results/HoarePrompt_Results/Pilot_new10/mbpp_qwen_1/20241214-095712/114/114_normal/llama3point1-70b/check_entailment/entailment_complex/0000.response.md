Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and a hashable object `elem`. The function then uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count how many times `elem` appears in `tup` and returns this count. Since the `count` method works for any hashable object and correctly counts occurrences within a tuple, the function satisfies the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
