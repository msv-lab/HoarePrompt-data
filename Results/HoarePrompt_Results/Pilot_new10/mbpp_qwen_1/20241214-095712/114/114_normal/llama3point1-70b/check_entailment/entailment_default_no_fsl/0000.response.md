Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This method works for all potential cases where `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is a hashable object. Since the function behavior matches the problem description and the output hints, and there are no edge cases or examples provided that show the function failing, the program is correct.
