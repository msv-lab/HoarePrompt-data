Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as inputs and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of tuples, which precisely meets the requirement specified in the problem description. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, further validating its correctness.
