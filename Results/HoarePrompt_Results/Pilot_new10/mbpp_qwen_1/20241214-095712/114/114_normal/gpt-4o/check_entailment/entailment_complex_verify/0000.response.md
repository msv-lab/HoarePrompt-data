Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The annotated version clarifies that the function accepts a tuple and an element, and returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as intended for tuples. Since the problem description does not specify any limitations to the input type other than it being a tuple, and the function is implemented to work correctly with tuples, the original assessment was not accurate.
