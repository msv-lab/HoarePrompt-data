Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original implementation of the function `func_1` align with the problem description. The function correctly uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. The provided assertions cover different scenarios and confirm the correctness of the function. Although the original assessment mentioned that the function should handle edge cases more explicitly, such as an empty tuple or a non-existent element, these issues are not mentioned in the problem description. Given the problem description focuses solely on counting occurrences, the current implementation meets the requirements accurately. Thus, the original assessment is not accurate in this context.
