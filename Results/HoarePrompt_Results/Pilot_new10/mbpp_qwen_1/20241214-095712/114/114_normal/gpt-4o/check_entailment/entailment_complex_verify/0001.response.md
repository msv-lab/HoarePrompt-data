Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a Python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `count` method of the tuple to achieve this. The annotated version of the code accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the provided test cases validate its correctness. Although the original assessment noted that the function should handle edge cases like an empty tuple, the assessment did not align with the actual requirements of the problem, which do not explicitly mention handling these edge cases. Therefore, the function is correct according to the given problem description and test cases.
