Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as intended for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. There are no logical errors or issues with the program based on the problem description and the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
