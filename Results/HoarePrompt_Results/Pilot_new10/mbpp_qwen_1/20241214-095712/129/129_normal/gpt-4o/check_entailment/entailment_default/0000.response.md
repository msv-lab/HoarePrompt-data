Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII numeric value using the built-in `ord()` function. The assertions provided (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) verify that the function works correctly for the given test cases. The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character, and the code satisfies this requirement. Since the code works correctly for the given examples and the logic appears sound for any single character input, the correctness of the program is **True**.
