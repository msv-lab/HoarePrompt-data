Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. The problem description asks for a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, which is exactly what this function does. Since the function works for all valid single-character strings (as per the provided output hints), and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause issues, the function meets the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
