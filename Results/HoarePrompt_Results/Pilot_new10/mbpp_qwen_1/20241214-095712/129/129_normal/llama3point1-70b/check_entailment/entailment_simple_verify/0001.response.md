Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors or undefined behaviors under the assumption of valid input.
