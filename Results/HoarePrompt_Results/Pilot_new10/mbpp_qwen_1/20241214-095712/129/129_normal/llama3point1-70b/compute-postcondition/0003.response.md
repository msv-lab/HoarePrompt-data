The annotated code states that the function `func_1` accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value. The actual code simply returns the ASCII value of the character using the `ord()` function. There are no additional conditions or operations beyond returning the ASCII value.

Given the simplicity of the function and the accuracy of the annotations, we can conclude that the function does exactly what the annotations describe without any missing functionality or edge cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value.**
