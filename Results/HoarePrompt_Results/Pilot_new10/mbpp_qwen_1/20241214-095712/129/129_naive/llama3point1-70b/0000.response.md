Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this program to fail, as `ord()` handles the conversion of characters to their ASCII values accurately for all valid single-character strings. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
