Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. The function handles a single character as input, which aligns with the problem description. Since the `ord()` function works for all printable and non-printable ASCII characters, this function will work correctly for any single character input within the ASCII range. Therefore, there are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
