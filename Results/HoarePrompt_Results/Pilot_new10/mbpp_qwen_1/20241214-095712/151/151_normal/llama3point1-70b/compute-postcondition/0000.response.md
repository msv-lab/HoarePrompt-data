The code initializes an empty list called `flat_list`. The initial state is that `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level). After executing this line of code, `flat_list` is assigned the value of an empty list, while `nested_list` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list**
