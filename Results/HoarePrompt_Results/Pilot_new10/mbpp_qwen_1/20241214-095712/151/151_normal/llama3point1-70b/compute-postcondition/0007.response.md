According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `nested_list` is a non-empty list, and `flat_list` is an empty list extended by either the flattened version of the first element of `nested_list` if the first element is a list, or the first element itself if it is not a list.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **First Element Check**: The loop extracts the first element of `nested_list` and processes it.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `nested_list` must still contain elements.

Since `nested_list` is a non-empty list, removing the first element would leave us with a potentially non-empty sublist. Thus, `nested_list` will still contain elements for the next iteration.

State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list (excluding the first element from the previous iteration), `flat_list` is an empty list extended by either the flattened version of the first element of the original `nested_list` if the first element was a list, or the first element itself if it was not a list.**

In simpler terms:
- `nested_list` now contains all elements except the first one.
- `flat_list` contains the result of processing the first element of the original `nested_list`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list (excluding the first element), `flat_list` is an empty list extended by either the flattened version of the first element of the original `nested_list` if the first element was a list, or the first element itself if it was not a list.**
