Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality to flatten a given nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle nested lists and ensures that all elements are added to the `flat_list`. The code works for various potential cases, including lists with multiple levels of nesting and different types of elements within the nested lists. The recursive approach ensures that all elements are eventually appended to the `flat_list`, making the function correct according to the problem description.
