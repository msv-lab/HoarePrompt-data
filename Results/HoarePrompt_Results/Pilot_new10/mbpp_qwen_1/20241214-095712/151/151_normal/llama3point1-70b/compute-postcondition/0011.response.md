Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `nested_list` is a non-empty list.
- If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended by the flattened version of that list using `func_1`.
- If the first element is not a list, `flat_list` contains that element appended to it.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. 

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **First Element**: The loop checks the first element of `nested_list` to determine how to process it.
2. **Extension of `flat_list`**: Depending on whether the first element is a list or not, the `flat_list` is updated accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Element Check**:
   - If the first element is a list, `func_1` is called to flatten that list, and the result is added to `flat_list`.
   - If the first element is not a list, that element is directly added to `flat_list`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - After processing the first element, the loop removes the first element from `nested_list` (since it has been processed).
   - The loop continues with the next element in `nested_list`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, the first element of `nested_list` becomes the new first element in the updated list.
   - The loop checks this new first element and processes it according to the rules mentioned above.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:

- **`nested_list`**: After processing the first element, the list `nested_list` will be reduced by one element (the first element is removed).
- **`flat_list`**: The state of `flat_list` will depend on whether the first element was a list or not. If it was a list, it will be extended; if it was an element, it will contain that element.

### Example Adjustment:

Suppose the first element of `nested_list` was a list and `func_1` was called to flatten it. Letâ€™s say the original `nested_list` was `[ [1, 2], 3 ]` and after processing the first element `[1, 2]`, the `nested_list` becomes `[3]` and `flat_list` contains `[1, 2]`.

For the next iteration:
- `nested_list` is now `[3]`.
- Since `nested_list` is still non-empty, the loop will continue.

State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list, possibly containing the first element as 3, and `flat_list` contains the flattened version of the previous first element.**

Since we don't know the exact content of `nested_list` after processing, we'll generalize:

State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list (possibly containing the first element as the processed element), and `flat_list` contains the flattened version of the previous first element if it was a list.**

### Final Answer:
State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list, and `flat_list` contains the flattened version of the previous first element if it was a list.**
