Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), `flat_list` is the fully flattened version of `nested_list` obtained by recursively extending `flat_list` with each element in `nested_list` until no more elements are lists.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`.
- If the element is a list, `func_1(i)` is called to flatten it and extend `flat_list` with the flattened elements.
- If the element is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

Since the loop continues to flatten nested lists recursively, it will continue to do so until there are no more elements in `nested_list` that are lists. At this point, `flat_list` will contain all the elements of the original `nested_list`, including all levels of nesting, flattened into a single list.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `nested_list` is empty), `flat_list` remains an empty list.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `flat_list` will be the fully flattened version of `nested_list`.
