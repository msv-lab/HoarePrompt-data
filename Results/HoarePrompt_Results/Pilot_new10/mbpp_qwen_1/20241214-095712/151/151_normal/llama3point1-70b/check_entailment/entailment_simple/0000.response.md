Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly flattens a given nested list structure. Here's why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function checks if an element in `nested_list` is a list (`type(i) == list`). If it is, the function calls itself recursively on that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result of the recursive call. This ensures that all nested lists are processed recursively.

2. **Non-List Element Handling**: If an element is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. This ensures that all non-list elements are added to the final flattened list.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements from the nested list structure, flattened into a single list.

Given these points, the function will correctly flatten any nested list structure, regardless of the depth of nesting. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
