`flat_list` extends by the result of `func_1(i)`. The function `func_1` is applied to the variable `i`, which is the first element of `nested_list` since `nested_list` is a non-empty list. After applying `func_1` to `i`, the resulting list is appended to `flat_list`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a non-empty list, `flat_list` contains the original flattened version of its first element plus the result of `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list, `flat_list` contains the original flattened version of its first element plus the result of `func_1(i)`**
