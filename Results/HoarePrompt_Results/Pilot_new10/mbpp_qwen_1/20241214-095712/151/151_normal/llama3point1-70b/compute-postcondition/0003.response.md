The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` impacts the program by extending the `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(i)`. Since `i` is a list, `func_1(i)` will be called with `i` as its argument. The function `func_1` is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact output, but we know it will extend `flat_list` with whatever `func_1(i)` returns.

Given that `i` is a list, let's denote the elements of `i` as `i[0], i[1], ..., i[n]`. After calling `func_1(i)`, `flat_list` will be extended with the result of `func_1(i)`, which means `flat_list` will contain the elements returned by `func_1(i)` appended to it.

Since the initial state does not specify what `func_1` does, we can only say that `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), `flat_list` is an empty list extended by the result of `func_1(i)`, `i` is the first element in `nested_list` and is a list.**
