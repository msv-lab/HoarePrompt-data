According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. The loop iterates over each item in `nested_list`. If the item is a list, `func_1(item)` is called and its result is extended into `flat_list`. If the item is not a list, it is simply added to `flat_list`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `nested_list` must contain at least one item.
- If `item` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`.
- Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all its previous elements plus the `item` from `nested_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more item in `nested_list` to iterate over.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. We know that `nested_list` must contain at least one item.
2. For the loop to continue, there must be another item left in `nested_list`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `nested_list` must contain at least two items (since we want to ensure there is an item left for the next iteration).
- The current item being processed has already been dealt with, so it is no longer relevant for the next iteration.

The state after the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`nested_list` must contain at least two items**.
