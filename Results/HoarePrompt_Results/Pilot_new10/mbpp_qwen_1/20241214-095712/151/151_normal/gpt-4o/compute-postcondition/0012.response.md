The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` extends the `flat_list` with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. However, since `item` is not specified in the initial state and `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact elements that will be added to `flat_list`. But we know that `flat_list` will include all elements returned by `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`.

Given the precondition that `nested_list` must contain at least two items, the output state will be:

- `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`.
- The number of elements added to `flat_list` depends on the number of items in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least two items; `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`.**
