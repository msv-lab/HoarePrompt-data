Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively handling sublists. The state descriptions accurately reflect the behavior of the function at different stages, and the provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
