Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions clearly show that the function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. The function uses recursion to handle nested lists and iteratively adds elements to the `flat_list`. Given the recursive nature of the function and the provided test cases, the original assessment is accurate. The function handles various potential cases correctly and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
