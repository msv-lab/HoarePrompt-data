Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state of the program at different points. The function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively handling sublists. The provided test cases cover various scenarios including lists with multiple levels of nesting and duplicate elements, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate based on the provided code and annotations.
