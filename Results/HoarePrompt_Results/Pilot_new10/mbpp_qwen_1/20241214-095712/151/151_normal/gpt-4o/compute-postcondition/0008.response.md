`flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. However, the exact values of `flat_list` and `item` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one item; `flat_list` is extended with `func_1(item)`**
