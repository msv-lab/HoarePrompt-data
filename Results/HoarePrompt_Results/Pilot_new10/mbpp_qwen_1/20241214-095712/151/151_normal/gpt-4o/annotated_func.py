#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level).
def func_1(nested_list):

    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):

        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is the initial list containing integers or other lists (nested to any level), `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list` where all nested lists are expanded into individual elements.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of `nested_list` where all nested lists are expanded into individual elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level). It recursively flattens `nested_list` by expanding all nested lists into individual elements and returns the resulting flattened list `flat_list`.
