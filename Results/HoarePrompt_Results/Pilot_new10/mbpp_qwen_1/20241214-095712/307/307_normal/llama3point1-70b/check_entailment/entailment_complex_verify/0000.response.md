Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment. The program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The loop continues incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number reaches `n` digits. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program after the loop, confirming that `idx` is indeed the smallest integer satisfying the condition. Since the provided annotations and the original assessment accurately reflect the behavior of the program, the original assessment is correct.
