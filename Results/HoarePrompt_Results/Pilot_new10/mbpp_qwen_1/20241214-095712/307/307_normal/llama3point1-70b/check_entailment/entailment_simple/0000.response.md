Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits.
2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function starts with an initial index `idx` set to 1.
   - It enters a `while True` loop, which will continue until the condition inside the loop is met.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the triangular number using the formula \( \text{triangular\_num} = \frac{\text{idx} \times (\text{idx} + 1)}{2} \).
   - It then checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If the condition is met, it returns the current value of `idx`.
   - Otherwise, it increments `idx` and continues the loop.
3. **Loop Termination**: The loop will terminate as soon as the triangular number with the index `idx` has at least `n` digits, ensuring that `idx` is the smallest such index.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the first triangular number (1) has 1 digit, so the function correctly returns 1.
   - For any larger `n`, the loop will eventually find the correct index.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and handles all cases correctly, the correctness of the program is **True**.
