`triangular_num` is updated to be `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given the initial value of `idx` is 3, we can calculate the new value of `triangular_num` as follows:
\[ \text{triangular\_num} = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 3 * 4 // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6 \]

The values of `n` and `idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
