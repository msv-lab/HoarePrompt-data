State: **`n` is a positive integer; `idx` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `while True` loop runs indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.
2. There are no conditions given in the loop header to determine when the loop should stop.
3. The current state shows `idx` is 1, but this alone does not affect the loop's execution as it is an infinite loop.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will execute at least once regardless of the initial values of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.
