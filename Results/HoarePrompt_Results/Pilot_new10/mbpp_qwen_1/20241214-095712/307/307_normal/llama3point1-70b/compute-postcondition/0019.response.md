Let's analyze the provided annotated code and return postconditions step by step.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

```python
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
    
    # State of the program after the loop has been executed: 
    # `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number with index `idx` is at least `n`, and `triangular_num` is the triangular number corresponding to this `idx`.
```

### Return Postconditions:
- Case_1: The program returns `idx` that is 1
- Case_2: The program returns `idx` that is 2
- Case_3: The program returns `idx` which is 3

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts with `idx` initialized to 1.
2. **Loop Execution**: The function enters an infinite loop where it calculates the triangular number for each `idx` using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. **Return Statement**: If the condition is met, the function returns `idx` and exits the loop.
5. **Increment**: If the condition is not met, `idx` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:

- **Edge Case**: If `n` is 1, the function will return `idx` which is 1 because the length of the string "1" is exactly 1.
- **Edge Case**: If `n` is 2, the function will return `idx` which is 2 because the length of the string "3" (for `idx = 2`) is 2.
- **Edge Case**: If `n` is 3, the function will return `idx` which is 3 because the length of the string "6" (for `idx = 3`) is 2, but we need to find the next `idx` where the length is 3, which would be `idx = 8` with `triangular_num = 36`.

### Summary of Functionality:

The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number with index `idx` is at least `n`.

### Final Summary:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number with index `idx` is at least `n`.**
