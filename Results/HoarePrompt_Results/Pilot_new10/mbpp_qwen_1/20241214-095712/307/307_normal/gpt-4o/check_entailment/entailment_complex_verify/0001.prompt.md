You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates over values of `k` starting from 1 and calculates the corresponding triangular number using the formula \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`. If it does, the function returns the current value of `k`.

To verify this, let's consider the mathematical properties of triangular numbers and the assertions provided:

1. For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which is the 4th triangular number (since \( T_4 = 10 \)). The function correctly returns 4.
2. For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 120, which is the 14th triangular number (since \( T_{14} = 120 \)). The function correctly returns 14.
3. For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which is the 45th triangular number (since \( T_{45} = 1035 \)). The function correctly returns 45.

The function handles the problem as described, and no counterexample has been found where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `k` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`, and `triangular_number` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
