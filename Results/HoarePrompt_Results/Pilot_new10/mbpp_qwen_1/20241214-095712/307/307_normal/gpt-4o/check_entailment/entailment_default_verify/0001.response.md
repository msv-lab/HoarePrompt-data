Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits by iterating over values of `k` and checking the length of the string representation of the triangular number. The provided assertions and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. There is no indication that the function fails for any other valid input within the constraints implied by the problem description.
