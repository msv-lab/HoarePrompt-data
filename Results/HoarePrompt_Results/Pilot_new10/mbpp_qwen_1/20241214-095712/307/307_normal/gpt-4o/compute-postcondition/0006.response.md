`k` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `k` is `2`. The values of `n`, `triangular_number`, and the condition about the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
