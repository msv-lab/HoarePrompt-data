Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest triangular number with `n` digits by iterating through values of `k` until the condition `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` is satisfied. The provided assertions validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
