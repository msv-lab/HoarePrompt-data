The code updates the value of `triangular_number` to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state where `k` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `triangular_number` as follows:

- `k` is 2
- `triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2 = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`

The calculation shows that `triangular_number` is updated to 3. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3**
