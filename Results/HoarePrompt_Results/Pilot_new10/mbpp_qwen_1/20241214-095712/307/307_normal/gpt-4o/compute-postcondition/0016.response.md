`k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` (which is "6") is not checked since the code does not depend on the result of this check. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 4, `triangular_number` is 6**
