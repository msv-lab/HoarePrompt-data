Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to find the index of the smallest triangular number with \( n \) digits. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should find the index of the smallest triangular number with \( n \) digits.
2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer \( n \) as input.
   - It initializes `k` to 1.
   - It enters a `while True` loop which will continue until the condition inside the loop is met.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the \( k \)-th triangular number using the formula \( \text{triangular\_number} = k \times (k + 1) // 2 \).
   - It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is equal to \( n \). If so, it returns \( k \).
   - If the condition is not met, it increments \( k \) and repeats the process.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) verify that the function works correctly for the given test cases.
     - For \( n = 2 \), the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, and its index \( k \) is 4.
     - For \( n = 3 \), the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, and its index \( k \) is 14.
     - For \( n = 4 \), the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, and its index \( k \) is 45.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic and passes the provided test cases, it meets the problem description for all possible values of \( n \).

Thus, the program is correct and satisfies the problem description.
