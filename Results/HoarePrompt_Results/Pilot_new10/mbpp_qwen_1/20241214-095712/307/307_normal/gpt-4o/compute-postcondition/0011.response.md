`k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` (which is "3") is 2, which is not equal to `n` (a positive integer). Since there is no return statement specified in the condition, the value of `n` and `triangular_number` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3**
