Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through natural numbers, calculating the corresponding triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, and returns the index `idx` as soon as this condition is met. Since the function handles all cases where `n` is a positive integer and returns the correct index for the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, it satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
