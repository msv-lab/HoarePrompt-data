Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each adjacent pair of elements has a difference of 1. 

Based on the provided test cases:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True`, which is correct because the numbers are consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False`, which is correct because the numbers are not consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False`, which is correct because the sequence is not strictly increasing (1, 2, 1).

Additionally, considering other potential cases:
- An empty list will return `False`, which is correct.
- A list with duplicate numbers but in consecutive order (e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 3]`) will correctly return `False`.
- A list with non-consecutive numbers in any order (e.g., `[5, 3, 2, 4]`) will correctly return `False`.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and no specific edge cases were found where the function does not work as expected, the program is correct.
