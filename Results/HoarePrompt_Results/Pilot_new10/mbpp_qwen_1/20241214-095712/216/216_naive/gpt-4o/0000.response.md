Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The program first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then, it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each pair of adjacent elements has a difference of 1. If any pair does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The program handles the given assertions correctly:
- For `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it returns `True`.
- For `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, it returns `False`.
- For `[1, 2, 1]`, it returns `False`.

Additionally, the program will handle other potential cases correctly as well. For example:
- For `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, it will return `True` after sorting.
- For `[1, 3, 5]`, it will return `False` because the differences between adjacent elements are not all 1.
- For `[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`, it will return `True`.

Since the program works correctly for the given examples and other potential cases, the correctness is `True`.
