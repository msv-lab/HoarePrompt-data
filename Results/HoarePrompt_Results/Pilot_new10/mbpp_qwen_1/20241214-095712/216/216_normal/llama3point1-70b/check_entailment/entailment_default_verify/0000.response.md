Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including those with duplicates, as long as they appear consecutively after sorting. However, the provided output hints and the function itself do not accurately reflect this behavior. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle lists with duplicate numbers correctly. For instance, if a list has duplicate consecutive numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]`), the function will return `True`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The function should only return `True` if all numbers in the list are unique and form a sequence of consecutive integers. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
