Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original explanation accurately describe the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function first sorts the list, ensuring that consecutive numbers are adjacent. Then, it uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to check if each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. Finally, it verifies that all elements are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set created from the list. This approach correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers without any duplicates. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
