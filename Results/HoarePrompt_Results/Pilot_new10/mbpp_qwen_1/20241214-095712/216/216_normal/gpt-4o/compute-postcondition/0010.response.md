Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements, and the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None).***
