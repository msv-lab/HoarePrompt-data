Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function handles various cases correctly, such as empty lists, lists with non-consecutive numbers, and lists with consecutive numbers. The annotated version also clearly describes the state of the program at different points, supporting the conclusion that the function operates as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
