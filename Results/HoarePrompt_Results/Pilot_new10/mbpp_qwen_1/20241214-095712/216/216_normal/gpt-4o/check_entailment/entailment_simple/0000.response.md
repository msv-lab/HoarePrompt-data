Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as input.
   - It first checks if the list is empty using `if (not lst)`. If the list is empty, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.
   - Next, it sorts the list `lst` and stores the sorted version in `lst_sorted`.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list and checks the difference between each pair of consecutive elements. If any pair of consecutive elements has a difference greater than 1, the function returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive pairs, the function returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The test cases provided (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, and `[1, 2, 1]`) cover various scenarios:
     - `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`: All elements are consecutive, so it should return `True`.
     - `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`: There is a gap between 3 and 5, so it should return `False`.
     - `[1, 2, 1]`: There is a duplicate but still not consecutive, so it should return `False`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies whether the input list contains consecutive numbers by sorting the list and checking the differences between consecutive elements.
   - It handles edge cases like empty lists and lists with duplicates appropriately.
   - The logic ensures that the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs.

Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all necessary edge cases correctly, the correctness is `True`.
