Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers.
   - `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements.
   - The difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1.
   - The loop checks if the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1. If it is not 1, the function returns False.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = len(lst_sorted) - 2`.

3. **End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 â‰¤ k < len(lst_sorted) - 2`).

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Maintaining the State:**
   - The list `lst` remains unchanged.
   - The sorted list `lst_sorted` remains sorted and contains at least 2 elements.
   - The difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is still 1 (as long as we are within the bounds of the list and have not encountered a non-consecutive pair yet).

6. **Updated State:**
   - The updated state should reflect the new value of `i`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements, and the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None). At the start of the next iteration, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

If we assume `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then the state can be generalized as:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements, and the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None). At the start of the next iteration, `i` is `k + 1`.**

To be specific and concrete, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements, and the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None). At the start of the next iteration, `i` is 3.**

In general form, the answer is:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements, and the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None). At the start of the next iteration, `i` is `k + 1`.**
