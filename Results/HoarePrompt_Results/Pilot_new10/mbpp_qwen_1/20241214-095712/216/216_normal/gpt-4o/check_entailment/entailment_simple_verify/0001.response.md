Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The annotations support this understanding:

1. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is.
2. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each adjacent pair of elements has a difference of 1.
3. If any pair does not meet the condition, it immediately returns `False`. If all pairs do meet the condition, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases and the annotated code confirm that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios, including empty lists, lists with duplicates, and lists with non-consecutive numbers. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
