The `sorted()` function sorts the list `lst` in ascending order, and assigns the sorted list to `lst_sorted`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, and lst is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, and lst is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`**
