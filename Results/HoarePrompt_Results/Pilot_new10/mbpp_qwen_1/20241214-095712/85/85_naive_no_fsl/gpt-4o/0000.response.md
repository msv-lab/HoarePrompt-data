Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and computes their difference. This approach ensures that the function works for any valid input array, as long as the array contains at least two elements. The test cases provided cover different scenarios (ascending order, descending order, and mixed order) and all pass, indicating that the function is correct for these cases. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues with the current implementation that would cause it to fail for any other valid input.
