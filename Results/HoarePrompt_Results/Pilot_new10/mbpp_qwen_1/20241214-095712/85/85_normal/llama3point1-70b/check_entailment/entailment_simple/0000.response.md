Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Specifically, the function computes the difference between the maximum value (`max(arr)`) and the minimum value (`min(arr)`) in the array `arr`. This approach ensures that the returned value is the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, as required by the problem description. Since this method works for all possible cases of input arrays (including empty arrays, arrays with one element, and arrays with multiple elements), the function consistently meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
