Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array (list) of integers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a list of integers (`arr`), which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Calculation**: The function calculates the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) in the list using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.
3. **Result**: It computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values (`max_val - min_val`) and returns this value as the result.

The provided test cases also validate the function:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is between 5 and 1, which is 4.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is between 9 and 1, which is 8.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum difference is between 3 and 1, which is 2.

Since the function correctly computes the maximum difference for all tested cases, and there is no indication that it would fail for other cases (assuming the input is a list of integers), the program is correct according to the problem description.
