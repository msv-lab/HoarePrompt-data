Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The original assessment was accurate because the function uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the array, respectively, and then computes their difference. This approach is correct and the provided test cases cover various scenarios (ascending order, descending order, and mixed order), confirming its correctness. The annotated version further supports the original assessment by explaining each step of the function's operation.
