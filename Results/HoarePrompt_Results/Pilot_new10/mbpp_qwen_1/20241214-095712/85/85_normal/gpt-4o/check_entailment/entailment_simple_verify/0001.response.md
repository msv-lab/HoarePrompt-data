Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function initializes `min_val` to the minimum value in the array and `max_val` to the maximum value in the array, then computes the difference `max_diff`. The test cases provided cover different scenarios and all pass, indicating that the function works correctly for these cases. The annotated version confirms that the function logic and the assertions align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
