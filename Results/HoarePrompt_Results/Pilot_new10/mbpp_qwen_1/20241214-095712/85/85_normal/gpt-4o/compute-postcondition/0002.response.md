The code calculates the difference between the maximum value (`max_val`) and the minimum value (`min_val`) in the list `arr` and assigns this difference to the variable `max_diff`. The values of `arr`, `min_val`, and `max_val` are used in this calculation, but the actual values of these variables are not specified. After executing the code, the variable `max_diff` is updated with the result of `max_val - min_val`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`; `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`; `max_diff` is `max_val - min_val`**
