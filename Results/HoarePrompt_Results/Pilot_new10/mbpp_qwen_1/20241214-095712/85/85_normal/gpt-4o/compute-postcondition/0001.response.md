The code sets `max_val` to the maximum value in the list `arr`. The previous value of `min_val` is still the minimum value in `arr`, but `max_val` is now set to the maximum value in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`; `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`**
