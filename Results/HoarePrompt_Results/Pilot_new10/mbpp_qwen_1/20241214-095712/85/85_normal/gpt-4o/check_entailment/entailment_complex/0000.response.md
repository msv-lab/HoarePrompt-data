Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array (list of integers). The function accomplishes this by first finding the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) in the input list `arr`, and then returning their difference (`max_diff`). 

The function works correctly for all the provided test cases:
1. For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`, so the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
2. For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`, so the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
3. For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `3`, so the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

The function consistently computes the maximum difference as required, and there are no edge cases (like empty lists or non-integer inputs) mentioned in the problem statement that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
