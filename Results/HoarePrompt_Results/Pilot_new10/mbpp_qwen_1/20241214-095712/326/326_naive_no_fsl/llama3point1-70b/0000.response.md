Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted array. Since the problem description asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, and the function only considers consecutive elements, it meets the requirement for all potential cases. The function sorts the array first, ensuring that the minimum difference will be found between consecutive elements, which is the smallest possible difference in the sorted array. Therefore, the function works correctly for all inputs.
