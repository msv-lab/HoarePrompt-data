According to the given for loop, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `arr`. The loop will execute as long as there are at least two elements in the list because the loop runs from `0` to `len(arr) - 2`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Length of `arr`**: The loop requires at least two elements in `arr` to execute. If `arr` has fewer than two elements, the loop will not execute.
2. **Initial Values**: The initial values of `arr`, `target`, and `min_diff` are provided but do not directly affect the condition for the loop to execute.

Given this, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least two elements for the loop to execute. We do not need to specify the exact values of `target` and `min_diff` because they do not influence the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the required state adjustment is:
- `arr` must have at least two elements.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements**
