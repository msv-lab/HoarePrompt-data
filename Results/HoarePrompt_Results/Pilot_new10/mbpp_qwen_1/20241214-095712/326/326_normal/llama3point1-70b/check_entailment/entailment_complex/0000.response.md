Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The function first sorts the input array `arr`. Sorting ensures that the smallest differences will be between adjacent elements, which simplifies finding the minimum difference.

2. **Finding Minimum Difference**: It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements (`arr[i]` and `arr[i+1]`). The variable `min_diff` keeps track of the smallest difference encountered during the iteration.

3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list.

The function does not require the `target` parameter mentioned in the problem description, but since no use of `target` is present in the code, it can be ignored as it is not relevant to the described functionality. The implementation focuses solely on finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
