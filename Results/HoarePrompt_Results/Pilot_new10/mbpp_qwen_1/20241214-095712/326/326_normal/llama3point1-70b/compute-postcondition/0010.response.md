Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 1] - arr[len(arr) - 2])`. If `diff < min_diff`, then `min_diff` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the state of `min_diff` does not change in any other case.***
