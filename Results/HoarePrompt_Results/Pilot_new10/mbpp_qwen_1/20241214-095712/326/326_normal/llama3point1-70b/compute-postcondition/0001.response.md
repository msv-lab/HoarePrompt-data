The code initializes the variable `min_diff` to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `arr` or `target`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `min_diff` with its specific value.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer; `min_diff` is positive infinity**
