You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The program first sorts the array, which ensures that the smallest differences will be adjacent. It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements and keeping track of the minimum difference found. This approach guarantees that the minimum difference is found for all possible pairs of elements in the array. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #`The program returns min_diff which is the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list 'arr'`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
