The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `target`, which is an integer. After sorting the list `arr`, the function calculates the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list. The function then returns this minimum difference.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, sort the list `arr`, and return the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, sorts the list `arr`, and returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list.**
