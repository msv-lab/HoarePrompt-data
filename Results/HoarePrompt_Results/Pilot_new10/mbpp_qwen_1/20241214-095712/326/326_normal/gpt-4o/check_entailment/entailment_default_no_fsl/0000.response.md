Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. It first checks if the length of the array `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the array and iterates through the sorted array to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the minimum difference is found regardless of the order of elements in the original array. All provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the code handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description.
