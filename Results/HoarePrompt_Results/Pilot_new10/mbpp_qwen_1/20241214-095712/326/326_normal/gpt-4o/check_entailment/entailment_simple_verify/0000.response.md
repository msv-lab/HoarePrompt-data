Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The annotations confirm that the function handles the sorting and comparison logic correctly, and the provided test cases demonstrate that the function works as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
