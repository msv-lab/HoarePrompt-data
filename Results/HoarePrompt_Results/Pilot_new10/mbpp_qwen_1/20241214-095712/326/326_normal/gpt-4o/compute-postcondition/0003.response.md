`arr` is sorted in ascending order. The length of the list `arr` remains the same, denoted as `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
