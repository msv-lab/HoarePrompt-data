`diff` is assigned the value `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is 0, `diff` is calculated as the difference between the first two elements of the list. The minimum difference (`min_diff`) remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is float('inf'), `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`**
