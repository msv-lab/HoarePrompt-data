The code sets `min_diff` to the value of `diff`. From the initial state, we know that `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`. Since `min_diff` was initially defined as the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list, and now it is being set to `diff`, we need to ensure that `min_diff` is updated to this new value.

- `arr` remains a sorted list of integers.
- `n` remains the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2.
- `i` remains 1.
- `diff` remains `arr[2] - arr[1]`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `min_diff` is updated to `diff`, which is `arr[2] - arr[1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
