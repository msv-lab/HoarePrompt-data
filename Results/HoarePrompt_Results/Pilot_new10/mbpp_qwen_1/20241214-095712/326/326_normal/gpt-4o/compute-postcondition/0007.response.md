Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found so far, initially set to infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, and the current value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`**
