Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers) and `n` (the length of the list).
   - It first checks if the length of the array `n` is less than 2. If so, it returns 0 because with fewer than two elements, there are no pairs to compare.
   - If the length is 2 or more, it sorts the array.
   - It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of consecutive elements.
   - It keeps track of the smallest difference encountered and returns this value once the iteration is complete.
   
3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided (`assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1`, `assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1`, `assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4`) correctly validate the function for different scenarios:
     - In the first assertion, the minimum difference is 1 (between 5 and 4).
     - In the second assertion, the minimum difference is also 1 (between 4 and 3).
     - In the third assertion, the minimum difference is 4 (between 20 and 16).

The function correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the provided assertions. Therefore, the program is correct.
