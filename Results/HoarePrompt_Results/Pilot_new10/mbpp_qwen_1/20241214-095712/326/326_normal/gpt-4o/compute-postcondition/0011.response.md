The code updates the variable `diff` to be the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the new value of `diff` will be `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. All other variables (`arr`, `n`, `min_diff`) remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list, `i` is 1, and `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
