According to the given for loop statement, the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `n-2` (since `range(n-1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`). For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. The variable `i` should start from 0.
2. The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, as stated in the initial state.

The list `arr` being sorted is an inherent property of the problem setup and does not need to be explicitly adjusted since the loop's operation does not depend on the initial value of `arr` itself but rather on the range of indices it iterates over.

The initial value of `min_diff` as `float('inf')` is correct and necessary for the loop to function correctly, as it ensures that the first comparison will update `min_diff`.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. `arr` is a sorted list of integers - This is a given and does not need adjustment.
2. `n` is the length of the list and `n >= 2` - This is a given condition.
3. `min_diff` is initially set to infinity (`float('inf')`) - This is necessary for the loop to function correctly.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to reflect the initial values of the loop variables and ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is float('inf'), `i` is 0**
