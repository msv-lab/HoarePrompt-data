The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The value of `diff` is `arr[4] - arr[3]`. Since `min_diff` is initialized with the value of `diff`, `min_diff` will also hold this value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` remains a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `diff` is `arr[4] - arr[3]`, and `min_diff` is equal to `arr[4] - arr[3]`.

Output State: **`arr` remains a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `diff` is `arr[4] - arr[3]`, and `min_diff` is equal to `arr[4] - arr[3]`**
