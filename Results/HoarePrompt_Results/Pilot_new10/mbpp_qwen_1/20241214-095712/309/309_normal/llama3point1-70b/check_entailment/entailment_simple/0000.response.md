Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the requirement to check if all characters in a given string `s` are the same. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if all characters in the string `s` are identical.
2. **Program Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1(s)` uses the `set()` function to create a set of characters from the string `s`.
   - Since a set contains only unique elements, if all characters in `s` are the same, the resulting set will contain exactly one element (the character repeated throughout the string).
   - The condition `len(set(s)) == 1` checks if the length of this set is 1. If it is, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This logic ensures that the function behaves as specified for any input string, meeting the requirement accurately. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
