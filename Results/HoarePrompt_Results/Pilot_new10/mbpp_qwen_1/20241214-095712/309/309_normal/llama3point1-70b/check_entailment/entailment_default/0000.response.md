Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are identical by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach works for all potential cases:

- If all characters are the same, the set will contain only one unique character, and the function will return `True`.
- If any character is different, the set will contain more than one unique character, and the function will return `False`.

The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if all characters in `s` are identical and `False` otherwise. There are no edge cases or examples where the provided code fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
