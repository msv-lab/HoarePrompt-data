Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. The output hints also correctly describe the functionality of the function, indicating that it accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in `s` are identical, otherwise it returns `False`. Based on the problem description and the given code, there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
