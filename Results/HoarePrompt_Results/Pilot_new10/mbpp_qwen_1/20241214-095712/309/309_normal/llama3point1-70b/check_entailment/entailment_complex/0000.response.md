Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set of its characters and then checking if the length of this set is 1. If the length is 1, it means all characters in the string are identical, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach works for any non-empty string and correctly identifies strings where all characters are the same. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
