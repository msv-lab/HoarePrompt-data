Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying if the length of the set is 1. This approach is sound and aligns with the problem description. Given the valid assumptions about the input being a non-empty string, the original assessment is accurate.
