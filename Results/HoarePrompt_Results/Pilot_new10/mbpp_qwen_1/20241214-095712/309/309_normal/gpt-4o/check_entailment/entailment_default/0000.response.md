Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether all characters in a string are the same. It handles the empty string case by returning `True` since there are no differing characters. For non-empty strings, it sets the first character as a reference and iterates through the string to check if each character matches the first one. If any character does not match, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration. All given test cases (`func_1('python') == False`, `func_1('aaa') == True`, `func_1('data') == False`) align with the expected behavior. Therefore, the code meets the problem description for every potential case.
