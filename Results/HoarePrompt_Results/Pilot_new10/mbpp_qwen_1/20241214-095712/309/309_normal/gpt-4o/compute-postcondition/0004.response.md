State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s` and the index is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
2. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. This is already given.
3. The variable `first_char` is mentioned as being the first character of `s`. This implies that `s` indeed has at least one character.
4. The loop variable `char` will take the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.
5. At the start of the loop, `char` should be set to the first character of `s`, and the index (though not explicitly named) should be 0.

Therefore, the initial state should include these adjustments to ensure the loop can start executing correctly.
