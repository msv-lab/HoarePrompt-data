Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in the handling of empty strings. The problem description requires the function to handle both empty and non-empty strings appropriately.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling of Empty Strings**: The current implementation of the function checks if `s` is empty using `if (not s): return True`. However, an empty string should also return `True` according to the problem description since there are no different characters to compare.

2. **Logic of the Function**: The logic of the function is mostly correct for non-empty strings. It checks each character against the first character and returns `False` if any character differs. However, the placement of the `return True` at the end is unnecessary and redundant because the function would have already returned either `True` or `False` inside the loop.

To fix these issues, the function should be updated as follows:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle both empty and non-empty strings correctly and meet the problem description.
