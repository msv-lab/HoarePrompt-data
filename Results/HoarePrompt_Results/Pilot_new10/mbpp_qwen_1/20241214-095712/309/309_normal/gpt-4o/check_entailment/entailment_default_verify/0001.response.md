Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in a string are the same. The function handles the edge case of an empty string by returning `True`, which is correct as an empty string trivially has all characters the same. The logic iterates through the string and ensures that all characters match the first character. The given test cases and the output hints confirm that the function works as intended for all valid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
