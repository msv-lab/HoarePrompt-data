Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in a given string are the same. It handles the case where the string is empty by returning `True`, which aligns with the problem description. The function iterates through each character in the string and compares it with the first character. If any character differs, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The given assertions also confirm that the function works as expected for the provided test cases. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
