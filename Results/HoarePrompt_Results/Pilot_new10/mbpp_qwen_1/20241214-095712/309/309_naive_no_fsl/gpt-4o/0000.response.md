Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all characters in a string are the same. It handles the case where the string is empty by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty string trivially has all characters the same. The function iterates through the string and compares each character with the first character. If any character differs, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover some scenarios:
- `func_1('python') == False`: All characters are different.
- `func_1('aaa') == True`: All characters are the same.
- `func_1('data') == False`: Not all characters are the same.

Given these test cases and the logic of the function, it seems to handle the problem description correctly for all potential cases. There doesn't appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling.
