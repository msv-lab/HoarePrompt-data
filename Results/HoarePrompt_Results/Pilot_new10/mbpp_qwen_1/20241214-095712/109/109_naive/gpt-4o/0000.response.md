Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all the elements of the second list. The function concatenates the first list (excluding its last element) with the second list, which satisfies the problem description for all given test cases and any other similar cases. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail based on the provided assertions and the nature of list operations in Python.
