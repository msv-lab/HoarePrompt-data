Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`) when `list1` is not empty. When `list1` is empty, the function correctly assigns `list2` to `list1`. Both scenarios align with the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
