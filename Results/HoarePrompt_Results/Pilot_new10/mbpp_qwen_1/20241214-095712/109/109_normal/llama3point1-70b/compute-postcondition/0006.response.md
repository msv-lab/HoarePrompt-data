The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. If `list1` is not empty, then `list1` contains the elements of `list2`. Otherwise, `list1` references the same list object as `list2` and retains its original contents. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to modify `list1` based on whether it is empty or not, referencing `list2` if empty, or updating its contents with those of `list2` if not empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, where if `list1` is not empty, it updates to contain the elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it references the same list object as `list2` and retains its original contents.**
