Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **If `list1` is not empty (`if list1 :`)**:
   - The last element of `list1` (i.e., `list1[-1:]`) is replaced with `list2`.
   - Since `list1[-1:]` refers to a slice of the list containing just the last element, replacing this slice with `list2` effectively replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`.

2. **If `list1` is empty (`else:`)**:
   - `list1` is directly assigned the value of `list2`.
   - In this case, `list1` will reference the same list object as `list2`, and `list2` retains its original contents.

In both cases, the function correctly modifies `list1` according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
