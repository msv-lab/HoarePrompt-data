Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list that contains all elements of `list1` except the last element, followed by all elements of `list2`. This behavior is demonstrated in the assertions:

1. For the input `([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`, the function returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.
2. For the input `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8])`, the function returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
3. For the input `(['red', 'blue', 'green'], ['yellow'])`, the function returns `['red', 'blue', 'yellow']`.

The function achieves this by using the slice notation `list1[:-1] + list2`, which removes the last element of `list1` and then appends all elements of `list2` to the remaining elements of `list1`. This operation satisfies the problem description for all given cases, including edge cases where either or both lists are empty. Therefore, the function is correct.
