Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The function achieves this by using list slicing (`list1[:-1]`) to exclude the last element of `list1` and then concatenating it with `list2`.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists of different lengths and types (numeric and string). There are no edge cases where the current implementation would fail based on the problem description and the hints. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case mentioned.
