Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`) for all potential cases:

1. If `list1` is not empty, the function correctly replaces the last element of `list1` with `list2`.
2. If `list1` is empty, the function assigns `list2` to `list1`.

The function handles both non-empty and empty lists correctly, and there doesn't seem to be any edge case that would make the function incorrect based on the problem description.
