Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. The provided test cases (`'PYTHon'`, `'FInD'`, `'STRinG'`) correctly demonstrate the function's behavior. The annotated version confirms that the function processes the input string and returns a new string containing only uppercase characters. There are no issues or edge cases that would render the function incorrect based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.
