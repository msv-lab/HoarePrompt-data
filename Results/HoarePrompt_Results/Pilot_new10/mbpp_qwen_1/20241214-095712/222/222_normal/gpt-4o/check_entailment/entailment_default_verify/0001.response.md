Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string. However, the provided implementation only keeps uppercase characters and discards lowercase ones, which means it does not remove "substrings" as described in the problem statement. Instead, it filters out lowercase characters entirely. While the output hints accurately describe the behavior of the function, they do not reflect the problem description accurately. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
