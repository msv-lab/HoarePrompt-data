Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description, which requires removing lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program retains only the uppercase characters and removes all other characters (both lowercase and non-alphabetic). For example:

- Given the input `'PYTHon'`, the expected output would be `'PYTHon'` if we were removing lowercase substrings, but the program outputs `'PYTH'`.
- Given the input `'FInD'`, the expected output would be `'FIND'` if we were removing lowercase substrings, but the program outputs `'FID'`.
- Given the input `'STRinG'`, the expected output would be `'STRinG'` if we were removing lowercase substrings, but the program outputs `'STRG'`.

To correctly implement the function, you should iterate through the string and construct a new string by excluding any lowercase characters. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if not char.islower()])
```

This version will correctly remove all lowercase substrings as required by the problem description.
