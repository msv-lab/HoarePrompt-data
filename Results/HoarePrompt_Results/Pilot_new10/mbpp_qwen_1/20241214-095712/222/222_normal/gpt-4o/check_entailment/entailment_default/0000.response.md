Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not remove lowercase substrings from the given string as described in the problem statement. Instead, it returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string. For example, the input `'PYTHon'` should result in `'PYTHon'` being transformed into `'PYTH'`, but the code actually transforms it into `'PYTH'`. Similarly, `'FInD'` should become `'FID'`, but the code results in `'FID'`.

The function should iterate through each character in the string and include only those characters that are uppercase. However, the current implementation only includes uppercase characters, effectively removing lowercase characters but not substrings. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
