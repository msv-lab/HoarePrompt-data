Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` removes lowercase substrings from a given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. However, the problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings entirely, not just filter out lowercase characters. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the function will return "HW" instead of removing the substring "ello".
