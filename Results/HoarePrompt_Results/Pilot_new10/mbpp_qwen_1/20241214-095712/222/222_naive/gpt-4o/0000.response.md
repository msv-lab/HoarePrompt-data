Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. Instead, it only removes lowercase letters, leaving uppercase letters and other characters unchanged. This does not meet the requirement of removing all lowercase substrings, as defined in the problem description. For example, consider the input `'aBcDe'`. The expected output would be an empty string since all characters are lowercase, but the program will return `'BCD'`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program fails to handle this case correctly and is thus incorrect.
