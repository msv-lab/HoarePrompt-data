Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` checks if the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. This approach is correct because:

- If the original list `nums` is already sorted, it will be identical to its sorted version.
- If the original list `nums` is not sorted, it will differ from its sorted version.

Thus, the function works correctly for all potential cases, ensuring that the input list is checked against its sorted counterpart accurately. There are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the requirement of checking if a list is sorted.
