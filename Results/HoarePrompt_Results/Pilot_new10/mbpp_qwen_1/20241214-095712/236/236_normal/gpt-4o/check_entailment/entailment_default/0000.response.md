Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. The function `func_1` iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If no such pair is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
1. A completely sorted list: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`
2. A list that is not sorted due to an out-of-order element in the middle: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`
3. A list that is not sorted because an element is out of order towards the end: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`

The function correctly identifies these cases and returns the appropriate boolean values. Therefore, the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
