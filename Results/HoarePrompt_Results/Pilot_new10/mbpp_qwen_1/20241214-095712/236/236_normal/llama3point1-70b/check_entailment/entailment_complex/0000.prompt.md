You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is sorted (either True or False)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function checks if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. The code does not handle any edge cases explicitly, but we should consider them in the functionality description.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: An empty list is considered sorted.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single element is also considered sorted.
3. **List with Repeated Elements**: The function will still consider a list with repeated elements as sorted if the order is maintained.
4. **Unsorted List**: Any unsorted list will return `False`.

### Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. It handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order.

**Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. It considers an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order as sorted.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
