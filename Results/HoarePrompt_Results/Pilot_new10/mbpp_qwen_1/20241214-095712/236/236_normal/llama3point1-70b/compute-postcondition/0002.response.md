The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function checks if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. The code does not handle any edge cases explicitly, but we should consider them in the functionality description.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: An empty list is considered sorted.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single element is also considered sorted.
3. **List with Repeated Elements**: The function will still consider a list with repeated elements as sorted if the order is maintained.
4. **Unsorted List**: Any unsorted list will return `False`.

### Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. It handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order.

**Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. It considers an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order as sorted.
