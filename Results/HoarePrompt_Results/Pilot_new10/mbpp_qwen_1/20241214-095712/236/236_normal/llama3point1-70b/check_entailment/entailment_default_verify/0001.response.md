Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks if the input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. The function works as intended for all potential cases, and the output hints confirm that the function handles a list of comparable elements and returns the correct boolean value based on whether the list is sorted or not. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that would make the original assessment inaccurate.
