Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and it returns a new list containing sublists where each sublist consists of every nth element from the original list, starting from each index in the range `[0, n)`. 

To verify this:

1. The function iterates over the range `range(n)` to start slicing the list at each index from `0` to `n-1`.
2. For each starting index `i`, it uses slicing `lst[i::n]` to get every nth element starting from `i`.
3. This process ensures that the function generates a list of sublists, each containing elements that are nth apart from each other.

Given these points, the program meets the requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is True.
