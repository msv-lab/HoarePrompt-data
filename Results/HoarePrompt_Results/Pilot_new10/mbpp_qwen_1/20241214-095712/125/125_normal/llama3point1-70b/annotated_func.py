#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains every nth element starting from index i for i in range(n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of lists where each inner list contains every nth element starting from index i for i in range(n). This includes handling all potential cases where `n` is within the valid range (1 <= n <= len(lst)).
