Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the explanation provided in the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists every nth element as specified. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` ensures that for each starting index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, it generates a sublist containing every nth element from the starting index `i`. This covers all potential cases where `n` is within the valid range (1 <= n <= len(lst)). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
