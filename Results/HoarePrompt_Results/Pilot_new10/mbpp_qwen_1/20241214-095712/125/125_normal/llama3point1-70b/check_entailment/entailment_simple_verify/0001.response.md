Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists every nth element as specified. The annotation clearly states that the function returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains every nth element starting from index i for i in range(n). Since the original assessment stated that the function works as expected for all potential cases based on the problem description, and the annotated version confirms this behavior, the original assessment is accurate.
