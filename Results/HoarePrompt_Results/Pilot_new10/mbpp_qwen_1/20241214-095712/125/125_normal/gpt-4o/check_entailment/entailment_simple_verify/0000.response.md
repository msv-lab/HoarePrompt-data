Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function `func_1` indeed groups elements by their index modulo `n`, which is consistent with the problem description. The function does not split the list into sublists where each sublist contains every `n`th element but rather groups elements in a way that each sublist starts from every `n`th position. Therefore, the original assessment stating that the function is incorrect is not accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.
