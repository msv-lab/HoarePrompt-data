The code initializes `result` as a list of `n` empty lists. This means that each element in the `result` list is an empty list itself.

- `lst` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `n` is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst), `result` is a list of `n` empty lists**
