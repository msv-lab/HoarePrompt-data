Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take a list (`lst`) and an integer (`n`) as inputs and split the list into sublists where each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function initializes an empty list of lists (`result`), with `n` sublists.
   - It then iterates over the input list using `enumerate` to get both the index (`i`) and the element (`element`).
   - For each element, it appends the element to the sublist at index `i % n`. This means that elements will be distributed across the sublists in a cyclic manner based on their position modulo `n`.
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the list of sublists.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly groups the elements of the input list into sublists based on their positions modulo `n`.
   - Each element from the input list appears in exactly one of the sublists, ensuring that all elements are included.
   - The order of elements within each sublist is preserved, matching the order in the original list.
   - The function handles the cases where the length of the list is not a multiple of `n` correctly by distributing the remaining elements evenly among the sublists.

Given that the program consistently distributes the elements of the input list into sublists as specified in the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
