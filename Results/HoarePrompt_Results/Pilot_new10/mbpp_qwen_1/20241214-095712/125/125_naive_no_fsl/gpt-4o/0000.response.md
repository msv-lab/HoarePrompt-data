Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly split the input list into sublists at every nth element. The assertions given in the problem description cover several cases, including different types of elements in the list (strings and integers), and different values of n. The function uses the modulo operator to distribute elements into sublists, which is consistent with the requirement to split the list every nth element. Given the examples and the logic of the function, it seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
