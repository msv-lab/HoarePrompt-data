Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It then uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst` and counts how many times each element appears in `tup`. Finally, it sums up these counts and returns the result. This approach ensures that the function returns the total count of occurrences of all elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`.

Since the function accurately performs the task of counting the occurrences of elements from the list in the tuple as specified in the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
