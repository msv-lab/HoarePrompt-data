Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of all elements specified in the `elements` list within the given `tup` tuple. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `elements` (a list). These match the problem description's requirement.

2. **Count Calculation**: The function uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate over each `element` in `elements`, and for each `element`, it counts its occurrences in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`. This ensures that the function accurately counts the total number of occurrences of all specified elements in the tuple.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed `count`, which is the total number of occurrences of all elements from the `elements` list within the `tup` tuple.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases assert that the function works as expected:
   - For `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])`, the output should be `3` (two 'a's and one 'b').
   - For `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7])`, the output should be `6` (three '1's, two '4's, and one '7').
   - For `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2])`, the output should be `2` (one '1' and one '2').

Since the function correctly counts the occurrences of the specified elements in the tuple for the given test cases and aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
