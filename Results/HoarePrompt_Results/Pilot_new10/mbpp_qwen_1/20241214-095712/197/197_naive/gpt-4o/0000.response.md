Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `elements` and sums up their counts in `tup`. The assertions provided in the example demonstrate the function working correctly for different inputs:

1. For the input `(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])`, the function returns `3`, which is the total count of 'a' and 'b' in the tuple.
2. For the input `((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7])`, the function returns `6`, which is the total count of `1`, `4`, and `7` in the tuple.
3. For the input `((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2])`, the function returns `2`, which is the total count of `1` and `2` in the tuple.

The function handles the problem description accurately and works correctly for the provided examples and any similar cases.
