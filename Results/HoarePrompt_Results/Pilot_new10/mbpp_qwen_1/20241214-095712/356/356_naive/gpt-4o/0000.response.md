Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespaces from the input string. This approach works correctly for all the provided test cases and should handle any string input without leaving any whitespace. Since the function behaves as expected in all the given examples and the logic is straightforward, it can be concluded that the program is correct for removing all whitespaces from a string.
