Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description to remove all whitespaces from a string, the function `func_1` correctly uses the `replace` method to achieve this. The annotated version clearly states that the function accepts a string `input_str` and returns the same string with all spaces removed, which aligns with the intended functionality. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a string), the function behaves as expected under all valid conditions. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
