Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespace characters from the input string using the `replace` method. The function passes all the provided test cases, and the annotations align with the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
