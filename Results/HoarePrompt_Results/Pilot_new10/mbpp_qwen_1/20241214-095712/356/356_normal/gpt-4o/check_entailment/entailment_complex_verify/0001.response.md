Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespace characters from the input string using the `replace` method. The provided test cases in the assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios, including strings with multiple spaces in different positions. The annotated version clearly shows that the function takes a string as input and returns a new string with all spaces removed, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
