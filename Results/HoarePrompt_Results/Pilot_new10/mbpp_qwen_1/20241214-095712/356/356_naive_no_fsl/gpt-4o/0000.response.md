Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string. The function appears to handle all the given test cases correctly. Additionally, since the `replace` method removes all occurrences of the specified substring (in this case, spaces), it will work correctly for any string with multiple spaces in different positions. There do not appear to be any edge cases or special characters that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
