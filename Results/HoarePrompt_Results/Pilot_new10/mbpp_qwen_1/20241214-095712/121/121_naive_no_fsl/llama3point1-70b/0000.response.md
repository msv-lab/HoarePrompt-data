Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic for finding Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) primes. The NSW primes are defined by the recurrence relation:

\[ S_0 = 0, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_{n+1} = 2S_n + S_{n-1} \]

The prime NSW numbers are those \( S_n \) that are prime. The program, however, is checking for primality and filtering based on the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, which is a common but incorrect heuristic for primality (it only works for primes greater than 3). Additionally, the starting point for the sequence is hardcoded to 7, which is the first NSW prime, but the program does not generate the entire NSW sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to generate the NSW sequence and check each term for primality. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    
    def is_prime(num):
        """Check if a number is prime."""
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    S = [0, 1]
    count = 1
    num = 7
    
    while count < n:
        next_S = 2 * S[-1] + S[-2]
        if is_prime(next_S):
            count += 1
        S.append(next_S)
    
    return num
```

This corrected function generates the NSW sequence and checks each term for primality until it finds the nth NSW prime.
