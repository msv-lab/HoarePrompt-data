The code swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S_next`. Initially, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, and `S_next` is 17. After the swap, `S0` will take the value of `S_next`, which is 17, and `S1` will take the value of the original `S0`, which is 3. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `S0` is 17, `S1` is 3, `i` is 4**
