`S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. Given the initial state where `S0` is 3 and `S1` is 7, the value of `S_next` is calculated as `2 * 7 + 3`, which equals 17. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
