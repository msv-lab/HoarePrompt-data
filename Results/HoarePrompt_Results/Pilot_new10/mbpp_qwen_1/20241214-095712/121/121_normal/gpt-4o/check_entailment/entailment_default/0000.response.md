Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime sequence. The NSW sequence is defined as follows:
\[ S_0 = 0, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \text{ for } n \geq 2 \]

However, the given code starts with:
\[ S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = 1 \]
and the recurrence relation is:
\[ S_i = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2} \text{ for } i \geq 2 \]

This means the sequence generated by the code does not match the NSW prime sequence. For example, the first few terms of the NSW sequence are:
\[ 0, 1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99, 239, 577, 1393, \ldots \]

While the first term matches (1), the subsequent terms do not match the NSW sequence. For instance, the 4th term should be 17, but the code generates 17 for the 4th input, which is correct for the NSW sequence, but the sequence generation logic is incorrect. The 3rd term should be 7, but the code generates 7 for the 3rd input, which is also correct for the NSW sequence, but again, the sequence generation logic is flawed.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
