The code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S1` and `S_next` respectively. Given the initial values `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, and `S_next` is 3, after the swap, `S0` will become 1 (the original value of `S1`), and `S1` will become 3 (the value of `S_next`). The values of `n`, `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2**
