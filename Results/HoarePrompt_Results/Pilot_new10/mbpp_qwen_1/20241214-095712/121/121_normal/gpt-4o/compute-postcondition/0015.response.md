The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function has two cases for its output:
- Case_1: The program returns 1.
- Case_2: The program returns the (n+1)th term in the sequence defined by S0 = 1, S1 = 1, and Si = 2Si-1 + Si-2 for i â‰¥ 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 1 or the (n+1)th term in the specified sequence based on the given conditions.
