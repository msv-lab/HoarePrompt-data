Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `S0` is 1
   - `S1` is 3
   - `i` is 2

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop is defined as `for i in range(2, n + 1):`.
   - This means the loop starts with `i = 2` and continues as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the condition `2 < n + 1` must hold true.
   - Simplifying, we get `n > 1`, which is already given as one of the initial states.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `S0` and `S1` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affect these variables.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

Putting it all together:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3**
