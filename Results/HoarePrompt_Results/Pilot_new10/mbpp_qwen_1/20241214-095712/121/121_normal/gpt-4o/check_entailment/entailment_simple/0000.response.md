Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given annotated program does not correctly implement the task of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. Instead, it generates the (n+1)th term of a specific linear recurrence relation defined by \(S_0 = 1\), \(S_1 = 1\), and \(S_i = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2}\) for \(i \geq 2\). 

The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are defined as a subset of primes from this sequence, but the provided code simply returns the (n+1)th term of the sequence without checking if it is a prime number. The sequence generated by the recurrence relation includes composite numbers as well, and thus, simply returning the (n+1)th term does not meet the requirement of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

To correct this, the program should check if the computed term is a prime number and ensure that it returns the nth prime number in the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. Here's an example of how the corrected function might look:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def next_newman_shanks_williams_prime(S0, S1):
    while True:
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        if is_prime(S1):
            return S1

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 2  # The first Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 2
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = next_newman_shanks_williams_prime(S0, S1)
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
    return S1
```

This corrected version ensures that the function finds the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number by generating the sequence and checking each term for primality until the nth prime is found.
