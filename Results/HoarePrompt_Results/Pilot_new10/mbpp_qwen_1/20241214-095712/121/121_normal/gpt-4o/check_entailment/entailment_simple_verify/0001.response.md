Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` generates a sequence based on the recurrence relation \( S_0 = 1 \), \( S_1 = 1 \), and \( S_i = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \). This sequence matches the provided test cases (7, 17, 41), which suggests that the function is correctly implementing the sequence generation logic. However, the problem description specifically asks for the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, and the annotated code does not generate prime numbers. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in stating that the function does not generate the correct sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.
