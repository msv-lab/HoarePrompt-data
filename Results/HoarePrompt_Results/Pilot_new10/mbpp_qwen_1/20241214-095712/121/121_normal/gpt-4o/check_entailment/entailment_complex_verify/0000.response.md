Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the function follows a specific recurrence relation: \(S_0 = 1\), \(S_1 = 1\), and \(S_i = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2}\) for \(i \geq 2\). This sequence is known as the Padovan sequence, not the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence. 

The Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence is defined by \(P_n = 2^{2^n} + 1\), and the provided function does not generate these values. The annotated version clearly shows that the function generates terms using the Padovan sequence, which is a different sequence from the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence. Therefore, the original assessment was incorrect.
