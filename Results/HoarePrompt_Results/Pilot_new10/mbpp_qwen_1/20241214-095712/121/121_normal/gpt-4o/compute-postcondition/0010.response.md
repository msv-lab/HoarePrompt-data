According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop runs for `i` values from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4. This means the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is now 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 4. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 4 to allow `i` to increment to 4 within the range specified by the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4**
