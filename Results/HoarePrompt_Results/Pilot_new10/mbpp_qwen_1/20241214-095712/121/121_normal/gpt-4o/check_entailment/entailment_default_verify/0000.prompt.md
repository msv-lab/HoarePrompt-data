You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence. The sequence is defined such that each term \( P_n \) is given by the formula:

\[ P_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \]

However, the provided function generates terms using a linear recurrence relation which does not match this definition. For instance, for \( n = 3 \), the expected value according to the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence is \( 2^{2^3} + 1 = 257 \), but the function returns 7. Similarly, for \( n = 4 \), the expected value is \( 2^{2^4} + 1 = 65537 \), but the function returns 17. These discrepancies show that the function does not correctly generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 1 if `n` is either 0 or 1, or the (n+1)th term in the sequence defined by \(S_0 = 1\), \(S_1 = 1\), and \(S_i = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2}\) for \(i \geq 2\) if `n` is greater than 1. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
