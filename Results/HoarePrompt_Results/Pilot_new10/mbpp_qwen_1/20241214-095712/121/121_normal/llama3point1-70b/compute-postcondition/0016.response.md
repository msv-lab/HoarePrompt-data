Let's analyze the given conditions and the `while True` loop step by step.

### Initial Conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n\) and \(n \neq 1\).
- `count` is either 2 or equal to `n`.
- `num` is 8.
- The function `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` if `num` is either 1 more than a multiple of 6 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, otherwise `count` equals `n`.

### Evaluating `func_1(num)`:
- `num` is 8.
- Check if 8 is 1 more than a multiple of 6: \(8 = 6k + 1\). Solving for \(k\), we get \(k = 1\). Thus, 8 satisfies this condition.
- Alternatively, check if 8 is 5 more than a multiple of 6: \(8 = 6k + 5\). Solving for \(k\), we get \(k = 0.333\), which is not an integer. Thus, 8 does not satisfy this condition.

Since 8 satisfies the first condition (\(8 = 6 \cdot 1 + 1\)), `func_1(8)` evaluates to `True`.

Given `func_1(8)` is `True`, `count` is 2.

### Loop Condition:
The loop is `while True:` which means it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no explicit conditions to break out of the loop.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
Since the loop is `while True`, there are no conditions to check within the loop itself. Therefore, the state of the program does not change based on the loop condition.

### Conclusion:
No states need to be adjusted because the `while True` loop will always execute another iteration regardless of the current values of `n`, `count`, and `num`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 8**
