Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program is using a heuristic (`num % 6 in [1, 5]`) to filter potential NSW primes, which is not correct. The NSW primes are generated by the recurrence relation \( S_0 = 0, S_1 = 1, S_{n+1} = 2S_n + S_{n-1} \), and the program should generate these numbers and check their primality. The current implementation does not generate the NSW sequence, but instead checks arbitrary numbers for primality based on the modulus condition, which is insufficient for finding NSW primes. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.
