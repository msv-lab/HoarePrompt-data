Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_2` indeed checks for prime numbers and filters them based on their modulus with 6. While the original assessment stated that this approach would not generate the correct sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, the annotated version shows that the function is correctly identifying prime numbers that satisfy the condition of being 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6. The sequence generated by this method aligns with the expected Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence starting from 7. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
