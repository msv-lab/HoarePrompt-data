Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or equal to `n`; `num` is 7; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True; if the number `num` is either 1 more than a multiple of 6 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` equals `n`***
