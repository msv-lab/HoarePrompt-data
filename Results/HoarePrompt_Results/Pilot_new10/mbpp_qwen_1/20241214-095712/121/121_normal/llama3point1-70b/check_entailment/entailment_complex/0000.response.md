Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic for finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. According to the problem description, the function should find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which is defined as a prime number of the form \(6k \pm 1\) (where \(k\) is an integer). However, the code incorrectly uses `num % 6 in [1, 5]` to check if a number is of the form \(6k \pm 1\).

To illustrate the issue, consider the number 11. According to the definition, 11 should be a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime because \(11 = 6 \cdot 1 + 5\). However, the current implementation would not consider 11 as a valid candidate because it checks if `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]` directly, which is incorrect.

A correct implementation should check if `num % 6 == 1` or `num % 6 == 5` separately. Here is a corrected version of the problematic part:

```python
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1):
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 == 1 or num % 6 == 5:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify Newman–Shanks–Williams primes and return the nth one.
