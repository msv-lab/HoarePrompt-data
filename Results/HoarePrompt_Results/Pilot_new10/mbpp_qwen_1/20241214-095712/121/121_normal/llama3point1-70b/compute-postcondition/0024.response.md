The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Given that `count` is either 3 or remains 2, if `count` was 2, it becomes 3; if `count` was 3, it remains 3. The values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 9**
