You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the position of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number to be found.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer representing the position of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number to be found, and n is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the position of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number to be found, and either the function returns `False` (if `n` is not a prime number) or `i` exceeds the integer value of `n` (if `n` is a prime number).
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n).
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n), the code to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number has been initiated, and `n` is not equal to 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is `n`; `num` is `6*n + 1` or `6*n + 5`; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True if the number `num` is either 1 more than a multiple of 6 or 5 more than a multiple of 6.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
