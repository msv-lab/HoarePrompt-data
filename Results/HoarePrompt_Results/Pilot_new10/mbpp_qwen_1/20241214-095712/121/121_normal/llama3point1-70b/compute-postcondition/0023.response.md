According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will execute indefinitely as long as no `break` statement is encountered. Since the condition for the loop to continue is always true, no specific adjustments are needed to the states provided.

However, we need to ensure that the given states are consistent and ready for the next iteration. The states provided are:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1
- `count` is either 3 or remains 2
- `num` is 9

Since the loop will execute again regardless of these states, no modifications are necessary. The states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is either 3 or remains 2; `num` is 9**
