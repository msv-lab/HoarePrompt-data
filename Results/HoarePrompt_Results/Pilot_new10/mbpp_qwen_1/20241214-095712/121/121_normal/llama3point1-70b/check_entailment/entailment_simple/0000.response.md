Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number as per the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Prime Number Check Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a number is prime. It returns `False` if the number is less than 2 or if it has any divisor other than 1 and itself. It returns `True` if the number is a prime.
   - This function is used within `func_2` to verify if a candidate number is a prime number.

2. **Newman–Shanks–Williams Prime Finder Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly starts with the initial known Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which is 7 (for n=1).
   - It then iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking each one with `func_1` to see if it is a prime and satisfies the condition of being 1 or 5 more than a multiple of 6.
   - The function keeps track of the count of such primes found and returns the number when the count matches the desired position `n`.

3. **Initialization and Loop Logic**:
   - The loop in `func_2` continues indefinitely until it finds the nth prime that meets the specified criteria. The use of `while True` combined with the appropriate conditions ensures that the correct prime is eventually found.
   - The increment of `num` by 1 in each iteration and the check using `func_1` ensure that only valid Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are considered.

Since both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) work together to correctly identify and return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
