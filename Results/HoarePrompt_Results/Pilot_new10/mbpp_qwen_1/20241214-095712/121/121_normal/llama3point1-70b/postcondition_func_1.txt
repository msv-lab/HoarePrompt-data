The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it returns 7. For other values of `n`, it starts with `num` set to 7 and increments `num` until it finds a number that satisfies the conditions of being 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6 and is a prime number according to `func_1(num)`. Once such a number is found and it matches the required count, it returns that number.
