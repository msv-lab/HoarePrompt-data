You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the definition, the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence is derived from the recurrence relation \( P_n = 2 \cdot P_{n-1}^2 - 1 \) with \( P_0 = 7 \). However, the current implementation does not follow this sequence. Instead, it checks for prime numbers and filters them based on their modulus with 6. This approach will not generate the correct sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. For example, the first few terms of the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence are 7, 47, 227, etc., which cannot be generated by the given code.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the position of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number to be found.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer representing the position of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number to be found, and n is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the position of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number to be found, and either the function returns `False` (if `n` is not a prime number) or `i` exceeds the integer value of `n` (if `n` is a prime number).
    return True
    #The program returns True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n).
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n), the code to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number has been initiated, and `n` is not equal to 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is `n`; `num` is `6*n + 1` or `6*n + 5`; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True if the number `num` is either 1 more than a multiple of 6 or 5 more than a multiple of 6.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
