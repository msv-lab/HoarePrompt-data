Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code for `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic for finding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The output hints suggest that the function should start with `num` set to 7 and increment `num` until it finds a number that is 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6 and is a prime number according to `func_1(num)`. However, the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]:` alone is not sufficient to identify Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. These primes are a subset of primes of the form \(4k \pm 1\), which means they should be checked against this form specifically.

For example, let's consider the case when `n = 2`. According to the problem description, the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime should be 23 (since 7 is the first one). However, the current implementation will continue to check numbers greater than 7 until it finds a prime that is 1 or 5 more than a multiple of 6. It will not specifically check if the number is of the form \(4k \pm 1\).

To correct this, the function should check if the number is of the form \(4k \pm 1\) before verifying if it is prime. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if num % 4 in [1, 3]:
            if func_1(num):
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
```

This ensures that only numbers of the form \(4k \pm 1\) are considered, aligning with the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.
