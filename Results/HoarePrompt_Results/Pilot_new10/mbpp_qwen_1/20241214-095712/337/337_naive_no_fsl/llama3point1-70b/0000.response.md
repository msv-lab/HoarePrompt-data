Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and includes only those elements that appear exactly once. The `lst.count(i) == 1` condition ensures that only non-repeated elements are considered in the sum. Given this logic, the function should work correctly for all potential cases where the problem description asks for the sum of non-repeated elements. There is no apparent edge case or input scenario where this function would fail to meet the requirements.
