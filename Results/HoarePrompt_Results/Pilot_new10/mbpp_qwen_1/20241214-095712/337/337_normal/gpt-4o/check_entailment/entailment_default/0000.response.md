Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers and returns the sum of unique elements in the list. The use of `set(lst)` ensures that all elements are unique, and `sum(set(lst))` calculates the sum of these unique elements. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for lists with duplicates and for lists with no duplicates. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and output hints.
