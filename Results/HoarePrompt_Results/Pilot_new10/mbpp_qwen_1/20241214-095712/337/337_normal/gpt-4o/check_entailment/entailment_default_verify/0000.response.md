Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list using `sum(set(lst))`. The output hints confirm that the function handles various cases, including lists with duplicates, empty lists, and lists with unique elements. The assertions in the problem description also validate the correctness of the program. There are no indications that the program fails for any potential inputs under the assumption that the input is always a valid list of integers.
