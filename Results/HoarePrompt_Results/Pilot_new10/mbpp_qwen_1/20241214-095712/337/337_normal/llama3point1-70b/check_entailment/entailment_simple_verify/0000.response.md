Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the program correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotation specifies that `lst` is a list of integers, and the function returns the sum of unique integers in the list, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
