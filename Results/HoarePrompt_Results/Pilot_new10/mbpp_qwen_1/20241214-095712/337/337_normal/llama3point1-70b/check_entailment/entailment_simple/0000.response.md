Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Here's a detailed breakdown:

- The function takes a list of integers as input (`lst`).
- It uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate over each element `i` in the list.
- For each element `i`, it checks if the count of `i` in the list is equal to 1 using `lst.count(i) == 1`.
- If the condition is met, the element `i` is included in the sum.
- Finally, the function returns the sum of all such non-repeated elements.

This logic ensures that only elements appearing exactly once in the list contribute to the sum, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
