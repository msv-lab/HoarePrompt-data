#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of unique integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list, where an integer is unique if it appears exactly once. If the list is empty or all elements are duplicates, it returns 0.
