Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original problem description clearly indicate that the function `func_1` is designed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The function iterates over each element in the list, checks if the element appears exactly once using `lst.count(i) == 1`, and includes it in the sum if true. Given the provided annotations and the logical structure of the function, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
