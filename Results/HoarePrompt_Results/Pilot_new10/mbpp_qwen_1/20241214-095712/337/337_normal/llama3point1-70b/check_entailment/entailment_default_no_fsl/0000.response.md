Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and includes only those elements that appear exactly once (i.e., `lst.count(i) == 1`). This approach handles all potential cases, including:

- An empty list, which results in a sum of 0.
- A list with duplicate elements, where only the unique elements contribute to the sum.
- A list with multiple unique elements, where the sum of these unique elements is returned.

The code logic aligns with the problem description and the output hints, ensuring it works correctly for every potential case.
