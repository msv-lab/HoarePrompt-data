The annotated code states that the function returns the sum of unique integers in the list `lst`. Let's break down the code and the annotations:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `lst` as input.
2. The `return` statement uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in `lst` and includes it in the sum only if `lst.count(i)` equals 1. This means it sums up elements that appear exactly once in the list.

Given this, let's summarize the functionality, considering potential edge cases:

- The function accepts a list of integers `lst`.
- It returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. An integer is considered unique if it appears exactly once in the list.

Potential edge cases and missing logic:
- If the list is empty, the function will return 0 because there are no elements to sum.
- If all elements in the list are duplicates, the function will return 0 because none of the elements will be included in the sum.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list, where an integer is unique if it appears exactly once. If the list is empty or all elements are duplicates, it returns 0.**
