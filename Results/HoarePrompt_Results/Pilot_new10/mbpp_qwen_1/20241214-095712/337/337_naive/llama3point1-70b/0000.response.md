Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to filter out elements that appear only once in the list using `lst.count(i) == 1`, and then sums these unique elements. This approach works for all potential cases, including lists with repeated elements and empty lists. Since no specific edge cases violate the functionality described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
