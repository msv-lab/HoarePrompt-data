You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list and using dynamic programming to find the largest subset where every pair is divisible. However, there is a logical issue in the inner loop where the condition `if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:` checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. This condition should instead check if `nums[j]` is divisible by `nums[i]` to ensure that every pair in the subset is divisible. 

For example, consider the input `[2, 4, 8]`. The program will incorrectly identify `[2, 4, 8]` as a valid subset because it checks divisibility in the wrong direction. The correct subset should be `[4, 8]` since both elements in the subset should divide each other. Therefore, the program fails to handle this specific case correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums` and returns either 0 or the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element. If the input list `nums` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to find the longest subsequence where each element divides the next, then returns the length of this subsequence. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
