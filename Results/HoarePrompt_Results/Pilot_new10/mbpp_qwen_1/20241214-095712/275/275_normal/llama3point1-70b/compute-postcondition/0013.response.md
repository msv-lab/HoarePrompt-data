Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list where each element is initially set to 1 except `dp[1]` which is 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `range(i)`, meaning it will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   The loop body checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, `dp[j]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 1.

5. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop will iterate over `range(1)`, which means `j` will only take the value 0 (the only value in the range).

6. **Loop Execution:**
   - For `j = 0`:
     - Check if `nums[i]` (which is `nums[1]`) is divisible by `nums[j]` (which is `nums[0]`).
     - If `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, increment `dp[j]` (which is `dp[0]`).
     - Otherwise, the values of `nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

7. **Adjusting States:**
   - If `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, `dp[0]` will be incremented by 1.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` remains 1.

8. **Final State After the Loop:**
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` is updated based on the divisibility check.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` remains 1.

Given the conditions, if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, `dp[0]` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element is initially set to 1 except `dp[1]` which is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[0]` is incremented by 1 if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`**.

However, since we don't know the actual values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`, we cannot definitively say if `dp[0]` is incremented. Therefore, the most general answer would be:

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element is initially set to 1 except `dp[1]` which is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.**
