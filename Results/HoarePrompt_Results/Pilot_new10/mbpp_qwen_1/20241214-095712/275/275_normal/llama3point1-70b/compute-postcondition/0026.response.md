`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this means `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[2] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (or may change), and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[2] + 1)`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (or may change), and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[2] + 1)`**
