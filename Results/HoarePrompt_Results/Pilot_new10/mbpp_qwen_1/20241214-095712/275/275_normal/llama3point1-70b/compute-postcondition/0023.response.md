`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated based on `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is 1, the relevant part is `dp[j]`, which means `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)`**
