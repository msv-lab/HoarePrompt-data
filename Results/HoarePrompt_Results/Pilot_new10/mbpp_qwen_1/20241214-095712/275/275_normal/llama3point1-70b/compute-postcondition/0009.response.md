Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is set to 2. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
