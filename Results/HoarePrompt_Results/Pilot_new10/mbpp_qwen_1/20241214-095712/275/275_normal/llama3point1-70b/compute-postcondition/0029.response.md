Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `j` is an integer ranging from 0 to `i-1`.
   - `nums[i]` is an integer in the list `nums`.
   - `nums[j]` is an integer in the list `nums` such that `j < i`.
   - `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` where each element divides the next element.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for i in range(1, len(nums)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

Given that the loop starts from `i = 1` (since `range(1, len(nums))` means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`), we need to determine the new state at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if the current value of `i` is `k`, the next value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - The value of `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1`.
   - The value of `j` should still range from 0 to the new value of `i - 1`, which is `(i + 1) - 1 = i`.
   - `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `dp[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, the state will be:

- `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
- `j` will range from 0 to `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` was not specified in the initial state, let's denote it as `k` (where `k` is the current value of `i`).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`i` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the current value of `i`), `j` is an integer ranging from 0 to `k`, `nums[i]` is an integer in the list `nums`, `nums[j]` is an integer in the list `nums` such that `j < i`, and `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` where each element divides the next element.**

To simplify, we can generalize this to:

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is an integer ranging from 0 to `i - 1`, `nums[i]` is an integer in the list `nums`, `nums[j]` is an integer in the list `nums` such that `j < i`, and `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` where each element divides the next element.**
