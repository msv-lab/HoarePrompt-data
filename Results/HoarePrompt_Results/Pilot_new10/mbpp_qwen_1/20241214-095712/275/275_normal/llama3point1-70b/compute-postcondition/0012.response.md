Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element is initially set to 1 except `dp[1]` which is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[j]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
