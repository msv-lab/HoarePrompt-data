State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0 (initially), and `j` is less than `i`**

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i)` means that `j` will iterate from 0 to `i-1`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: It is given that `i` is 1.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `j` must satisfy the condition `0 <= j < i`. Given `i = 1`, this translates to `0 <= j < 1`.

Since `j` starts at 0 and must be less than `i` (which is 1), the loop will execute for `j = 0`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are to ensure that `i` is 1, and `j` is 0 initially and satisfies the condition `j < i`.
