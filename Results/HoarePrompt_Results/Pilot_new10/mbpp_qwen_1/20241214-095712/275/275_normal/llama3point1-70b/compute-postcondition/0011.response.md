The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `i` and `j` are both initialized to 1, the line of code specifically updates `dp[1]` to be `max(dp[1], dp[1] + 1)`. Given that `dp` is initialized as a list of ones, `dp[1]` is initially 1. Therefore, `max(dp[1], dp[1] + 1)` evaluates to `max(1, 2)`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums` except `dp[1]` is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1**
