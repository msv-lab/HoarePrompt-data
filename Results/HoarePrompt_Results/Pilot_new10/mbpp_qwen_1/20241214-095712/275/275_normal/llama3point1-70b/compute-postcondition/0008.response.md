The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the precondition that `nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we can proceed as follows:

- Initially, `dp[1]` is set to 1 (since `dp` is a list of ones).
- Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` and `j` is 0, `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`.
- The code updates `dp[1]` to be the maximum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] + 1`. Given that `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated to `max(1, 1 + 1)`, which is 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `dp[1]` is 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `dp[1]` is 2**.
