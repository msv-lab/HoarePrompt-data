Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.
- `i` is 1.
- `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

### Analysis

1. **Initialization and First Iteration (i = 1)**
   - `i = 1`, so the loop runs for `j` in the range `[0]`.
   - If `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`, then `dp[1]` is set to `max(dp[1], dp[0] + 1)`.
   - Initially, `dp[1] = 1`, and `dp[0] = 1`, so if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`, `dp[1]` becomes `2`.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 2)**
   - `i = 2`, so the loop runs for `j` in the range `[0, 1]`.
   - For `j = 0`: If `nums[2] % nums[0] == 0`, then `dp[2]` is set to `max(dp[2], dp[0] + 1)`.
   - For `j = 1`: If `nums[2] % nums[1] == 0`, then `dp[2]` is set to `max(dp[2], dp[1] + 1)`.
   - Initially, `dp[2] = 1`, and `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 2` (if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`).

3. **General Iteration (i = k)**
   - `i = k`, so the loop runs for `j` in the range `[0, 1, ..., k-1]`.
   - For each `j < k`: If `nums[k] % nums[j] == 0`, then `dp[k]` is set to `max(dp[k], dp[j] + 1)`.

4. **Final State After All Iterations**
   - After all iterations, `i` will eventually become `len(nums)`, meaning the loop terminates.
   - For each `k` from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`, `dp[k]` will be updated based on its previous values and the condition `nums[k] % nums[j] == 0`.

### Final Output State
- `nums` remains a list of positive integers and is not empty, and it is sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each element `dp[k]` (for `k` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`) is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element.
- `i` is `len(nums)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations.

**Output State:**
- `nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each element `dp[k]` (for `k` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`) is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element.
- `i` is `len(nums)`.
