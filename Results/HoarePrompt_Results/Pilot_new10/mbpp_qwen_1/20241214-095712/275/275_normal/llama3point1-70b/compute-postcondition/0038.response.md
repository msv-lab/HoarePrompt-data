`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j < i`. Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`, the value of `dp[i]` could potentially increase based on the value of `dp[j] + 1`. However, the exact updated value of `dp[i]` depends on the current values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`.

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer plus 1, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`; `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for some `j < i`**
