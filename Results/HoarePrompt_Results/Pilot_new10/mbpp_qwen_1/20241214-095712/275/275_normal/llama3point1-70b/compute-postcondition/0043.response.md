The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of positive integers. 

- In Case_1, the function returns 0.
- In Case_2, the function returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of positive integers `nums` and return either 0 or the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element.
