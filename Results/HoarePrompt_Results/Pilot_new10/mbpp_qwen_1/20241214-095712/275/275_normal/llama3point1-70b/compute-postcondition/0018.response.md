State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for j in range(i):` will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 0. If `i` is 0 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. The initial value of `j` is 0 because the loop starts iterating from 0 up to but not including `i`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` is initialized to 0.
