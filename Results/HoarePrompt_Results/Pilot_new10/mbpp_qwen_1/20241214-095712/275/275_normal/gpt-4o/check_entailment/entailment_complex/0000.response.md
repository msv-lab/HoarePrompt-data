Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - The function needs to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset satisfies the condition that one number divides the other.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of positive integers `nums`.
   - If the list is empty, it returns 0.
   - It sorts the list to facilitate checking divisibility in a linear manner.
   - It initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` where each element divides the next.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, it checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If so, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which corresponds to the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next.

### Why it works:
- The sorting step ensures that we can efficiently check divisibility in a forward direction.
- The dynamic programming approach (`dp` array) allows us to build up solutions incrementally by leveraging previously computed results.
- The condition `if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` ensures that the current element `nums[i]` is divisible by the previous element `nums[j]`.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])`: Returns 4 (subset: [1, 3, 6, 18])
- `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])`: Returns 3 (subset: [10, 5, 20])
- `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])`: Returns 4 (subset: [1, 3, 6, 18])

Each test case confirms that the function correctly identifies the largest subset with the required property.

Since the program logic aligns perfectly with the problem description and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
