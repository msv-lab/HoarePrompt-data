According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`. The loop body is omitted, but we know the conditions under which the loop runs and how the variables evolve.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions are true:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`).
- `i` must be greater than 0.
- There exists a `j` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must iterate to the next valid index within the range `0` to `i-1`.

Since `i` must be greater than 0 and there exists a `j` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` remains the same, but `j` needs to be incremented by 1 if it was previously valid.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` remains the same (since it's already greater than 0 and there exists a valid `j`).
- `j` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`), `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be incremented by 1 such that there still exists a valid `j` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.**
