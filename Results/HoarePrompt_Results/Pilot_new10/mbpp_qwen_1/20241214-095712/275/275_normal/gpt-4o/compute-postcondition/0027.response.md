Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element; `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`; `j` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
