The code updates the `dp` list such that `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. The value of `i` is not directly modified but is used to index the `dp` list. Given the initial conditions, we know that `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` and `i` is 1 more than the previous `i`.

Since the exact values of `nums`, `dp`, and the current value of `i` are not provided, we can represent the updated value of `dp[i]` in terms of `dp[j]`. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` (with `j` being the index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`), and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
