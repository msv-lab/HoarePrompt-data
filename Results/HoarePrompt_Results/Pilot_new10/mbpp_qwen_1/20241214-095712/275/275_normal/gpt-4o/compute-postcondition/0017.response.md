Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
   - `i` is the length of `nums`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`.
   - Currently, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, meaning the loop condition `i < len(nums)` is false.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is already equal to `len(nums)`, it cannot be incremented further within the current context of the loop.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed in `nums`, `dp`, or `i` for the loop to continue as the condition `i < len(nums)` will never be true.

**Final State:**
- `nums` remains unchanged (a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order).
- `dp` remains unchanged (a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element).
- `i` remains unchanged (equal to `len(nums)`).

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`**.
