Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element; `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`; `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < len(nums) - 1` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. Otherwise, `dp[len(nums) - 1]` remains unchanged.***
