Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair of elements is divisible. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1(nums)` takes a list of positive integers as input.
   - It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns `0`, which is correct because an empty list cannot form any subset where every pair is divisible.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is a crucial step because we need to ensure that for any pair `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `i < j`, `nums[i]` should divide `nums[j]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - A list `dp` is initialized with all elements set to `1`. Each element `dp[i]` will eventually store the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
   - The nested loops iterate through the list to update the `dp` values:
     - For each element `nums[i]`, it checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`).
     - If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, it means `nums[j]` can be part of the subsequence ending at `nums[i]`. The `dp` value for `nums[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
   - This ensures that `dp[i]` contains the maximum length of the subsequence ending at `i` where each element divides the next.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `max(dp)`, which gives the length of the longest subsequence where every pair is divisible.

Given these steps, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
