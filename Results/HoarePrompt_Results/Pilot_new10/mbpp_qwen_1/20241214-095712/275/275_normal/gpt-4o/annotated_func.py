#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and nums is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, and `i` is the length of `nums`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[-1]` (or `dp[len(nums)-1]`) contains the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value found in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element, returning this length.
