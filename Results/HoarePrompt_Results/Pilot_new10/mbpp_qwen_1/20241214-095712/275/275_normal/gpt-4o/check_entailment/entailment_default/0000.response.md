Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The function `func_1` first checks if the input list is empty and returns 0 if it is. If not, it sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element.

The dynamic programming approach uses a list `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the length of the longest subsequence ending with `nums[i]`. For each element `nums[i]`, it checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) and updates `dp[i]` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

The examples provided:

1. `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4` - The largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.
2. `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3` - The largest subset is `[10, 5, 15]`.
3. `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4` - The largest subset is `[18, 6, 3, 1]`.

These examples confirm that the function works as expected. There are no edge cases or specific conditions mentioned in the problem description that the code fails to handle, and the output hints align with the code's functionality. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
