You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and nums is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, and `i` is the length of `nums`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[-1]` (or `dp[len(nums)-1]`) contains the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value found in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element, returning this length.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
