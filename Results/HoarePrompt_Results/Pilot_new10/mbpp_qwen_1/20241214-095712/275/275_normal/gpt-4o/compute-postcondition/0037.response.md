To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the loop can continue.

### Given Information:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `dp[j] + 1` for some index `j`, where `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Increment of `i`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
   
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < i`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, for the next iteration, `j` will still be within the valid range (`0` to `i-1`).

3. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is in the correct state for the next iteration.
   - `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
   - `nums` remains the same because the list does not change inside the loop.
   - `dp` array should be updated according to the previous iteration's rule, but we need to focus on the state of `i` for the next iteration.

### Updated State:
- `nums` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The updated `dp` array values are not explicitly stated, but we know they were updated based on the condition `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` for `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is incremented by 1 (so it is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1), and `dp` is updated according to the previous iteration's rule.**

However, since the exact state of `dp` is not specified, we only need to adjust the state of `i`:

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

If you need a more detailed state, including the updated `dp` values, you would need additional information about the specific values in `dp` after the previous iteration.
