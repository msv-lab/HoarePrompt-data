Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, and `i` is equal to `len(nums)`. Additionally, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j` where `j < i`.**
