According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop `for j in range(i)` will execute if `i` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `i` is 0. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop cannot execute because `range(0)` results in an empty range.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is greater than 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0**
