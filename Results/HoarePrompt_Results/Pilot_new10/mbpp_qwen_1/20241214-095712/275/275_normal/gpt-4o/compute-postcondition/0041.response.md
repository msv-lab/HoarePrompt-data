Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, and `i` is the length of `nums`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[-1]` (or `dp[len(nums)-1]`) contains the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.**
