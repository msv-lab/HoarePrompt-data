In the given code snippet, `dp[i]` is updated using the formula `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. Here, `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, and `j` would be iterating through indices less than `i`. However, since no specific values for `dp` or `nums` are provided, we can only generalize the impact on the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
- `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`.

After the code runs, the value of `dp[i]` (which is `dp[len(nums) - 1]`) will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i`. Since `i` is the last index, there are no elements to the right of `i`, so `dp[i]` cannot be increased further by this operation.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element; `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`; `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < len(nums) - 1`.**
