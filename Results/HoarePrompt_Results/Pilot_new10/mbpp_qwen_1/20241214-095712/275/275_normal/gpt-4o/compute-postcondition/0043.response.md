The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of positive integers. The function returns either 0 or the maximum value found in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of positive integers `nums` and return either 0 or the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.
