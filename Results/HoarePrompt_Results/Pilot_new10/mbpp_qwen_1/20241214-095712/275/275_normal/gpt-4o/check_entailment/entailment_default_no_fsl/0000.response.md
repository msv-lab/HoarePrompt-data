Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The dynamic programming approach ensures that for each number in the sorted list, it checks all previous numbers to see if they divide the current number and updates the maximum subset size accordingly. The code handles the case where the input list is empty by returning 0, which aligns with the problem description. The examples provided in the problem description also match the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, the code should work correctly for every potential case based on the given problem description and examples.
