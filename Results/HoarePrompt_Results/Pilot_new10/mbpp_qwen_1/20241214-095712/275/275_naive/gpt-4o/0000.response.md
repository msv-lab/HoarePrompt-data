Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a solution to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum subset size that can be formed ending at each index. Given the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])` returns 4, which is correct because the subset `[1, 3, 6, 18]` satisfies the condition.
2. `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])` returns 3, which is correct because the subset `[10, 5, 20]` satisfies the condition.
3. `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])` returns 4, which is correct because the subset `[18, 1, 3, 6]` satisfies the condition.

The algorithm sorts the array first, ensuring that the divisibility condition is checked in a sorted manner. The dynamic programming array `dp` keeps track of the maximum subset size that can be formed up to each index, and the final result is the maximum value in `dp`. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for the given problem description and the provided test cases.
