Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- A list with elements not matching the given element (`['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue'`).
- A list with no matching elements to the given element (`[1, 2, 3, 4], 7`).
- A list where all elements match the given element (`['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green'`).

Since the function behaves as expected in all these cases, it meets the problem description for every potential case.
