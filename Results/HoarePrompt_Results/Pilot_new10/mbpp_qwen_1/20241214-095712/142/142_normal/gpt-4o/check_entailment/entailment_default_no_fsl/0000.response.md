Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through each item in the list `lst` and checks if it is equal to the given `element`. If any item is not equal to the element, it immediately returns `False`. If all items are equal to the element, it returns `True`. This logic correctly implements the requirement to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. An empty list or a list where elements do not match the given element (`['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue'`).
2. A list where elements do not match the given element (`[1, 2, 3, 4], 7`).
3. A list where all elements match the given element (`['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green'`).

Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct for every potential case described.
