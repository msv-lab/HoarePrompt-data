Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is correct, but upon closer inspection, the function actually checks if no item in the list matches the given element rather than checking if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The output hints also reflect this behavior: "The function accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`, and returns `False` if any element in `lst` matches `element`; otherwise, it returns `True`." This means that the function is actually checking for the absence of the given element in the list, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is incorrect based on the problem description.
