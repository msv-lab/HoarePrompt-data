Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function behaves as expected in all these cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
