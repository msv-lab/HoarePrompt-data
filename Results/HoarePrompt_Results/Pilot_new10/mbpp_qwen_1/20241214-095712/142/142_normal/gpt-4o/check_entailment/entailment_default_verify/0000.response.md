Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the function, and the provided test cases cover various scenarios, confirming that the function works as intended based on the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
