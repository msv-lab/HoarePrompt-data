Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as input and uses the built-in `all()` function to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The expression `all(item == element for item in lst)` will evaluate to `True` if every item in the list `lst` is equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description, which states that the function should return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the program is correct.
