Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`). It uses the built-in `all()` function to check if every item in the list is equal to the given element. The expression `item == element for item in lst` generates a boolean iterator where each item in the list is compared to the given element. The `all()` function then returns `True` if all these comparisons are `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the given element. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This behavior precisely aligns with the requirement to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element, making the program correct for all potential cases.
