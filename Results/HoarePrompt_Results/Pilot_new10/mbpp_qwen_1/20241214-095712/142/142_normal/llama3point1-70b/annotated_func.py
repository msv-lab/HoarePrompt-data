#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value to compare against all items in the list.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all items in list 'lst' are equal to 'element', otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`, and returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`. If there is at least one item in `lst` that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`.
