Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the functionality of the provided function `func_1`. The function correctly uses the `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The original assessment is accurate because the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the intended behavior.
