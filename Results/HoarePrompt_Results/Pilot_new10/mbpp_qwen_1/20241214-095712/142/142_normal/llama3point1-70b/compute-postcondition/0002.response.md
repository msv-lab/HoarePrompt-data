Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`, and returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`. If there is at least one item in `lst` that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`.** 

This summary covers the functionality based on the actual code and includes the edge case where the list might be empty. If the list is empty, the condition `all(item == element for item in lst)` will evaluate to `True` because there are no items that are not equal to `element`.
