Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original explanation both accurately describe how the function `func_1` works. The function uses the `all()` function to check if every item in the list `lst` is equal to the given `element`. The annotation and the original explanation correctly state that the function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
