#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers sorted in ascending order consisting of the elements of `list1`, followed by the elements of `list2`, followed by the elements of `list3`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It concatenates these lists into one list, sorts the concatenated list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.
