`combined_list` is assigned the value of `list1 + list2 + list3`. This operation concatenates the three lists into one new list. The original lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is a list consisting of the elements of `list1`, followed by the elements of `list2`, followed by the elements of `list3`.**
