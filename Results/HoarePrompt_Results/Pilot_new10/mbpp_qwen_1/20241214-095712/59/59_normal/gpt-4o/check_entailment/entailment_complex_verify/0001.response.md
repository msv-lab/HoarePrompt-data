Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function takes three lists as input, concatenates them, and then sorts the combined list in ascending order. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a sorted list containing all elements from the input lists. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
