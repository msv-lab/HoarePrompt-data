Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and then sorts it using Python's built-in `sorted` function. The output hints confirm that the function accepts three lists of integers, combines them into one list, sorts the combined list, and returns the sorted list. Given that the `sorted` function in Python handles all edge cases such as empty lists and duplicate elements, the function `func_1` will produce the correct result for any valid input lists. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
