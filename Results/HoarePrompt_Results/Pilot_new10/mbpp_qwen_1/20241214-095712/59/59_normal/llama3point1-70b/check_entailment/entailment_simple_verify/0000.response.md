Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single list and then sorts it using Python's built-in `sorted` function. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function behaves as expected, combining and sorting the elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Given that the `sorted` function in Python handles all edge cases, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
