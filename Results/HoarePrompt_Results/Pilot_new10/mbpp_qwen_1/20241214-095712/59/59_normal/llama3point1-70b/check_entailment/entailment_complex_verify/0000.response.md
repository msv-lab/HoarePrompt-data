Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the functionality of the provided `func_1` function. The function takes three lists of integers, merges them into one list, sorts the combined list using Python's built-in `sorted` function, and returns the sorted list. Given the problem description and the assumptions about valid input, the function meets the requirements correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
