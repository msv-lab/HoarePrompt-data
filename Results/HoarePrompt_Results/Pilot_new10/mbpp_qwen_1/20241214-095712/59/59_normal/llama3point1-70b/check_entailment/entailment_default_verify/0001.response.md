Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly merges and sorts three lists of integers as described in the problem statement. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting three lists of integers, combining them, sorting the result, and returning the sorted list. Since the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases that the function does not handle (e.g., non-integer elements, different data types, etc.), the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is appropriate.
