Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input and returns a single list that is the result of merging these three lists and sorting them in ascending order. This exactly matches the requirement to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The use of the `sorted` function ensures that the combined elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are returned in sorted order, which satisfies the problem description.
