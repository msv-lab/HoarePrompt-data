Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted()` function. This approach ensures that the returned list is sorted, which satisfies the requirement of merging and sorting three lists into a single list. Given that the function handles all inputs correctly and produces the expected output for any combination of integer lists, the code is correct according to the problem description.
