Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly merges and sorts three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then applies the `sorted()` function to return a single sorted list. This approach ensures that the resulting list is sorted and covers all potential cases without any missing logic or edge cases. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
