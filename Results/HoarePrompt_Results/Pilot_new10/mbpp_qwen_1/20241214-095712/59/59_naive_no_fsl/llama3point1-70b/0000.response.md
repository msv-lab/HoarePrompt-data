Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input and merges them into a single list using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists. Then, the `sorted` function is used to sort the concatenated list. This approach ensures that the resulting list is always sorted, regardless of the contents of the input lists. Since the function handles all possible inputs correctly according to the problem description, the program is correct.
