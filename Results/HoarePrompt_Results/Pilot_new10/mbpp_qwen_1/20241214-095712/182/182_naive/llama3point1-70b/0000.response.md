Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string. This exactly matches the problem description. Since the function uses list comprehension with `s[-1]` to get the last character of each string, it will work correctly for any tuple of strings, including edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
