Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character from each string in the tuple, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The annotations clarify that `tup` is a tuple containing strings, and the list comprehension effectively retrieves the last character of each string. There are no issues or edge cases identified that would make the original assessment inaccurate.
