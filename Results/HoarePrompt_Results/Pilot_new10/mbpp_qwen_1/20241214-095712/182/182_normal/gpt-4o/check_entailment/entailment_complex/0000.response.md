Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It extracts the rear (last) index element from each string within the given tuple. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input tuple `tup` and returns a list of the last characters of these strings. The assertions provided also validate that the function works as expected for different inputs, ensuring that it consistently meets the requirement of extracting the last character from each string in the tuple.
