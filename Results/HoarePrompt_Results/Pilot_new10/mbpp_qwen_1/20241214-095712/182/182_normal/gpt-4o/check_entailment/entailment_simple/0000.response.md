Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character using the index `s[-1]`. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
