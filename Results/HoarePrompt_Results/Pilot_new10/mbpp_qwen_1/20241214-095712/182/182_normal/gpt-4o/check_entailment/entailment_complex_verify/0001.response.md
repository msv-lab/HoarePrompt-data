Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The original assessment is accurate because the function logic matches the problem description, and the provided assertions pass without any issues. The annotated version further clarifies that the function processes each string in the tuple and returns a list of their last characters, which aligns with the intended functionality.
