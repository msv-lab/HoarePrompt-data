#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple 'strings'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `strings`, which is a tuple of strings. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character of each string. The function then returns a list containing these last characters.

The annotations suggest that the function returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple. This is consistent with the actual code.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

**The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.**
