Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple and returns a list of these characters. The problem description asks for a function to extract only the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple, which is exactly what the function does using a list comprehension. The function handles all potential cases where the tuple contains strings of different lengths and even empty strings. In all cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
