Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This exactly matches the problem description which asks to extract the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` correctly extracts the last character of each string `s` in the tuple `strings`. This solution works for all possible cases of tuples containing strings, making the program correct according to the given problem description.
