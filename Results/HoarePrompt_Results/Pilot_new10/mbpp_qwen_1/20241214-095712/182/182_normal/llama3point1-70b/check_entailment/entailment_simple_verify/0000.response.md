Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the functionality of the function `func_1`. The function takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string, which matches the problem description. The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly implements the required behavior for any valid input tuple of strings.
