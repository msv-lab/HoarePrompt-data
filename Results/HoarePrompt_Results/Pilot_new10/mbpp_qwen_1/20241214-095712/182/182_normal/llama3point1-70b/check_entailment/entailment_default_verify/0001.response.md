Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior of extracting the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list of the last characters from each string. Since the function handles the expected input correctly without any edge cases being missed, the original assessment is accurate.
