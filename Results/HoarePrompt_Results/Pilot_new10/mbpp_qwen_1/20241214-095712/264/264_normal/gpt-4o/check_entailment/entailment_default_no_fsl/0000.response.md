Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that converts degrees to radians using the formula `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. The assertions in the code verify that the function works correctly for the given test cases (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees). Since the function logic is correct and the provided test cases confirm its accuracy, the program meets the requirements for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
