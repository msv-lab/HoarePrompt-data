#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a floating-point or integer number representing the angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns degrees multiplied by pi/180
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a floating-point or integer parameter `degrees`, which represents an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying `degrees` by Ï€/180.
