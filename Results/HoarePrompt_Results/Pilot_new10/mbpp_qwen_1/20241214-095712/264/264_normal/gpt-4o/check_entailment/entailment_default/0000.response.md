Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The assertions given in the program confirm that the function works correctly for the provided test cases (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees). Given the problem description and the output hints, the function appears to handle the conversion accurately for all potential cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
