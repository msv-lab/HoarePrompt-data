Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The assertions provided in the annotated version also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the program handles valid inputs correctly and there are no logical errors identified, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
