Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input `deg` by `math.pi / 180`, which aligns with the mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians. This formula works for all real numbers, including both float and integer inputs. Since the problem description does not specify any constraints or edge cases beyond the basic conversion, and the function handles all cases as expected, the code is correct.
