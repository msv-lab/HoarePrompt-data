Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` takes a float or integer `deg` representing degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as described. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would make the function incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
