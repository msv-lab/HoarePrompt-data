Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). Since the function handles any valid input (float or integer) as described in the problem statement and the annotation, the original assessment is accurate.
