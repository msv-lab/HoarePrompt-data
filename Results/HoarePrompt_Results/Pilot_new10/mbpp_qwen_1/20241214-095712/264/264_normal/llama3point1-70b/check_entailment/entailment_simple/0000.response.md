Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians as specified in the problem description. The formula used in the function `func_1(deg)` is `deg * math.pi / 180`, which accurately converts an angle from degrees to radians. This formula is derived from the fact that π radians is equivalent to 180 degrees. Therefore, multiplying the degree measure by π and dividing by 180 gives the equivalent radian measure. The function accepts a float or an integer representing degrees and returns the corresponding radian value, meeting the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
