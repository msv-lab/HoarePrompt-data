Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The explanation in the original assessment is accurate, and there are no issues with the provided code based on the problem description and the annotations.
