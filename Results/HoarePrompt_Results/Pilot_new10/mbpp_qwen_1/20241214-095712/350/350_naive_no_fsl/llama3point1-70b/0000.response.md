Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates over the array in reverse order and returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element. If the target element is not found, it returns -1. This approach is correct for finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function works for all potential cases, including edge cases such as when the target is not present in the array or when the array contains multiple occurrences of the target element.
