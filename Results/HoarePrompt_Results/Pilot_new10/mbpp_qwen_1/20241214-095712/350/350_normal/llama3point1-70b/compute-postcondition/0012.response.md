The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, which is an integer. Based on the given cases, the function returns:

- `i`, which is `len(arr) - 1` and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `target`
- `len(arr) - 2`
- An integer 'i' that is equal to the length of 'arr' minus 3 and is greater than or equal to 0
- `-1`

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and return one of the specified values based on the conditions provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and returns either `len(arr) - 1` if the last element equals `target`, `len(arr) - 2`, an integer equal to the length of `arr` minus 3 (and greater than or equal to 0), or `-1`.**
