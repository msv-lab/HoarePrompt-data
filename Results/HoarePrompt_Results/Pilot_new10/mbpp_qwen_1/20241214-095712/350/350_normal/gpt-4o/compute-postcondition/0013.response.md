Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. It iterates over the list in reverse order to find the index of the first occurrence of `x`. If `x` is found, it returns the index of `x`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.** 

This summary covers all potential cases:
- If `x` is found at the last element of `arr`, the function returns the index of that element.
- If `x` is found at any other position in the list, the function returns the index of that element.
- If `x` is not found in the list, the function returns `-1`.
