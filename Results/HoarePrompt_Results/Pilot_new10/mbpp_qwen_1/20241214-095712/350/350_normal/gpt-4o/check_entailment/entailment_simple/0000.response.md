Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the last position of a given element `x` in a sorted array `arr`.

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` iterates over the array from the end to the beginning using a `for` loop. This ensures that the last occurrence of the element `x` is found as soon as it is encountered.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When the element `x` is found in the array, the function returns the index of its last occurrence.
   - If the element `x` is not found in the array, the function returns `-1`.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided cover different scenarios:
     - The first assertion checks for a single occurrence of `x`.
     - The second assertion checks for multiple occurrences of `x`, ensuring that the last one is found.
     - The third assertion checks for no occurrences of `x`.

5. **Consistency with Problem Description**:
   - The function adheres to the requirement of finding the last position of the element in a sorted array.
   - It correctly handles cases where the element is not present in the array by returning `-1`.
   - The implementation ensures that the search is done efficiently from the end to the beginning of the array, which is optimal for finding the last occurrence.

Given the above points, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
