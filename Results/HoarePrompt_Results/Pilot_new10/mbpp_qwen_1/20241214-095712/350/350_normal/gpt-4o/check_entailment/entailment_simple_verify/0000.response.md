Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, ensuring that it finds the last occurrence of the target element `x`. If `x` is not found, the function correctly returns `-1`. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is not accurate in this context.
