State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` is an integer.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the for loop statement:

```
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization and Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arr` in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` (the last index) down to `0`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must initially be less than `len(arr)` because the loop stops when `i` becomes `-1`.

3. **List `arr`**:
   - Since the list `arr` is already defined and its length is known, no adjustment is needed for the list itself.

4. **Variable `x`**:
   - The variable `x` is an integer but is not used directly in the loop condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `x`.

### Conclusion:

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start. Specifically, `i` must be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, and the loop condition should allow it to run correctly.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`**.

This ensures that the loop can start and execute correctly based on the given conditions.
