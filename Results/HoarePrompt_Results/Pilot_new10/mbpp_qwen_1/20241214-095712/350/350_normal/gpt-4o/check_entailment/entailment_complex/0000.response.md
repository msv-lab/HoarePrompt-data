Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
2. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` iterates over the array in reverse order starting from the last element to the first element. This ensures that the first match found during the iteration will be the last occurrence of the element `x` in the sorted array.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is found, the function returns its index.
   - If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1`.

The assertions provided in the annotated program validate different scenarios:
- The first assertion checks for a single occurrence of `x` in the array.
- The second assertion checks for multiple occurrences of `x` and verifies that the function returns the last index.
- The third assertion checks a scenario where `x` is not present in the array, and the function correctly returns `-1`.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and handles all the provided test cases correctly, the program is deemed correct.
