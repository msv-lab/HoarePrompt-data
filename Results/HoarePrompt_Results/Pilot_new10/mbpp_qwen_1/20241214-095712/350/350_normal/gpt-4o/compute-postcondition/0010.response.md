Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `i` is either the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `arr` or -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` is an integer.
- **Loop Behavior:** The loop iterates over the elements of `arr` from the last to the first, checking if each element is equal to `x`.
  - If `arr[i] == x`, the function returns the current index `i`.
  - If `arr[i] != x`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- **After Loop Execution:**
  - If `x` is found in `arr`, the loop will return the index of the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the list.
  - If `x` is not found in `arr`, the loop will complete its execution and return `-1`.

Since the loop iterates through the entire list if `x` is not found, the final value of `i` will be `-1` if `x` is not present in the list. If `x` is found, `i` will be the index of the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the list.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes is that `i` is either the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `arr` or `-1` if `x` is not found in `arr`.
