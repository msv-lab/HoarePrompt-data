Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, which ensures that the first match (from the end) is the last occurrence of the element. If the element is not found, it returns `-1`, which is the expected behavior as per the problem description. The provided test cases in the annotations also validate this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment, which stated the program is incorrect, is not accurate in this context.
