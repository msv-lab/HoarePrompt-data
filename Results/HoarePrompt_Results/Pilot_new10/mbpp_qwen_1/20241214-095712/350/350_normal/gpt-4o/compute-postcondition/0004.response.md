Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `x` is an integer.
- `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.
- The last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - `i` starts at `len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 (`i >= 0`).

3. **Adjusting `i`:**
   - In each iteration, `i` decreases by 1 (`i -= 1`).

4. **Previous Iteration:**
   - We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` where `0 <= k < len(arr) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` was decremented from `len(arr) - 1` to `k` in the previous iteration.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

6. **State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - `arr` remains the same.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `k - 1`.

7. **Loop Execution:**
   - To continue the loop, `i` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `k - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `k >= 1`.

### Conclusion
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`, where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Since `i` was decremented by 1, we can say `i` is now `len(arr) - 2`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.**
