Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly indicates that the function `func_1` takes a list as input (`input_list`) and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which requires the function to convert a list to a tuple. Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., always a list), the function behaves as expected and the original assessment of its correctness being True is accurate.
