Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as an argument and returns a tuple containing all the elements from that list. This behavior is consistent with the problem description which states, "Write a function to convert a list to a tuple." 

The function `func_1` uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list `lst` into a tuple. This operation will work correctly for any list input, as demonstrated by the provided test cases:

1. `assert func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]) == (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`
2. `assert func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]) == (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`
3. `assert func_1([58, 44, 56]) == (58, 44, 56)`

In each case, the function correctly converts the list to a tuple without any modification or additional operations that would deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
