Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected by converting lists into tuples. The original assessment is accurate because the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
