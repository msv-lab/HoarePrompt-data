Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list into a tuple. The assertions in the code snippet also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the function handles the provided examples correctly and the problem description matches the implementation, the program is correct for every potential case presented.
