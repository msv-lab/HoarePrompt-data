Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly iterates through each digit of the input number `n`, adds them to the `total` variable, and returns the sum. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the annotations support the conclusion that the function works as intended. Therefore, the original assessment that the function is correct is justified.
