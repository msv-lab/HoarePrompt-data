Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function aims to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
2. **Logic**: 
   - It initializes `total` to 0.
   - Uses a `while` loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `n` using `n % 10` and add it to `total`.
   - Removes the last digit from `n` using integer division `n //= 10`.
   - Continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) verify the function works correctly for different inputs.

Given that the logic accurately sums the digits of the input number and the assertions pass, the function meets the problem description for all non-negative integers. Therefore, the program is correct.
