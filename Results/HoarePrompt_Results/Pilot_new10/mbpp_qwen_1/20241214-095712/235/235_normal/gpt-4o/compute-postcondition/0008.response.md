`n` is calculated as `n_original // 100`, `total` is calculated as `2 * (n_original % 10)`. The code adds `n % 10` to `total`. Since `n` is `n_original // 100`, `n % 10` is equivalent to `(n_original // 100) % 10`. Therefore, `total` is updated to `total + (n_original // 100) % 10`.

Given that `n_original` must be at least 100, let's denote `n_original` as `100a + 10b + c` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits and `a >= 1`. Then:
- `n = (100a + 10b + c) // 100 = a`
- `total = 2 * ((100a + 10b + c) % 10) = 2 * c`

After the code runs, `total` becomes `2c + a`.

Output State: **`n` is `n_original // 100`, `total` is `2 * (n_original % 10) + (n_original // 100) % 10`, `n_original` must be at least 100**
