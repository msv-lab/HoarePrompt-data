The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Given that `n` must be greater than 0 and `total` is `n % 10`, the value of `total` remains unchanged because the operation only affects `n`. Therefore, the updated state of `n` is its original value divided by 10 (integer division).

Let's denote the original value of `n` as `n_original`. After executing `n //= 10`, `n` becomes `n_original // 10`. The value of `total` remains `n_original % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is `n_original // 10`; `total` is `n_original % 10`**
