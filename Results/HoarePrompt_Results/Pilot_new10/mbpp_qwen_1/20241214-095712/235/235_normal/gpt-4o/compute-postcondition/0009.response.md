`n` is initially set to `n_original // 100`. The code divides `n` by 10 using the floor division operator `//`, which means the last digit of `n` is removed. Given the initial state, `n` originally had three digits, where `n_original // 100` gives the hundreds digit, `(n_original // 10) % 10` gives the tens digit, and `n_original % 10` gives the units digit.

After the operation `n //= 10`, the tens digit of the original `n` becomes the new value of `n`.

Therefore, the updated value of `n` is the tens digit of the original `n_original`.

Output State: **`n` is the tens digit of the original `n_original`; `total` is `2 * (n_original % 10) + (n_original // 100) % 10`; `n_original` must be at least 100**
