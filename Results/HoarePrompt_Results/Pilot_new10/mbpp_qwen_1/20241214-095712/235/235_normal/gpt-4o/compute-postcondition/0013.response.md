Let's analyze the annotated code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer.
2. Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
3. There is a while loop that runs as long as `n` is greater than 0.
4. Within the loop, the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`) is added to `total`.
5. The value of `n` is updated by removing its last digit using integer division (`n //= 10`).
6. After the loop completes, `total` contains the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`.
7. The function returns `total`.

The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the function. However, let's consider the edge cases:

- If `n` is 0, the while loop will not execute, and `total` remains 0. This matches the return postcondition.

Given the code and the annotations, the function behaves as described and handles all edge cases correctly.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.**
