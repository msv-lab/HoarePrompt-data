According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n_original // 100`, and `n_original` must be greater than 0.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is `n_original // 100` and `n_original` must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n` itself is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Since `n` is derived from `n_original` by performing an integer division by 100, for `n` to be greater than 0, `n_original` must be at least 100. This is because the smallest value of `n` would be `100 // 100 = 1`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n_original` is at least 100.

State: **`n` is `n_original // 100`, `total` is `2 * (n_original % 10)`, `n_original` must be at least 100**
