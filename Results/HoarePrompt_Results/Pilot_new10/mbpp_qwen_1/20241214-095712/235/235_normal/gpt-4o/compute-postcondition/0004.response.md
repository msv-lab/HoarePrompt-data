Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `n` is `n_original // 10`
  - `total` is `n_original % 10`
- Loop condition:
  ```python
  while n > 0:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n = n_original // 10`
   - `total = n_original % 10`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n > 0`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - From the given state, `n` is already `n_original // 10`, which means `n` is the integer division of `n_original` by 10.
   - Therefore, `n` will be greater than 0 as long as `n_original` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - Since `n` is already `n_original // 10`, we don't need to adjust this state further.
   - However, we need to ensure that `n` was not reduced to 0 in the previous iteration. This means `n_original` should be greater than 0.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The state `n = n_original // 10` is already correct for the loop to continue.
   - The only thing we need to ensure is that `n_original` was greater than 0 to avoid reducing `n` to 0.

### Final State
- `n` is `n_original // 10`
- `total` is `n_original % 10`
- `n_original` must be greater than 0

### Answer
State: **`n` is `n_original // 10`, `total` is `n_original % 10`, `n_original` must be greater than 0**
