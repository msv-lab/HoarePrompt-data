Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of its digits.
2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function initializes `total` to 0.
   - It uses a `while` loop to iterate through each digit of the number `n`.
   - In each iteration, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`) to `total`.
   - It then removes the last digit from `n` (using integer division `n //= 10`).
   - Once `n` becomes 0, the loop exits, and `total` contains the sum of all digits.
   - The function returns `total`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1(345) == 12`: The digits of 345 are 3, 4, and 5. Their sum is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
   - `func_1(12) == 3`: The digits of 12 are 1 and 2. Their sum is 1 + 2 = 3.
   - `func_1(97) == 16`: The digits of 97 are 9 and 7. Their sum is 9 + 7 = 16.

Since the function logic accurately reflects the problem description and the test cases confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
