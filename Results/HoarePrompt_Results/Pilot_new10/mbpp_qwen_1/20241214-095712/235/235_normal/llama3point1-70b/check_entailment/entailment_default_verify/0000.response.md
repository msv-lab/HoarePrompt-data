Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The output hints and the explanation provided in the original assessment are accurate. The function converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. This approach works for all non-negative integers, including edge cases like 0, single-digit numbers, and multi-digit numbers. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
