#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of digits of the non-negative integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:Let's analyze the provided code and annotations step by step:

1. The function `func_1` takes a parameter `n`, which is specified to be a non-negative integer.
2. The return statement in the function uses a generator expression to convert each digit of `n` to an integer and sums them up.

From the code, we can see that:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- The function converts `n` to a string to iterate over each character (digit).
- Each character is converted to an integer.
- The integers are summed up and returned.

Given the annotations and the code, the function correctly performs the described operation without any missing functionality or edge cases that need special mention.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

**The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.**
