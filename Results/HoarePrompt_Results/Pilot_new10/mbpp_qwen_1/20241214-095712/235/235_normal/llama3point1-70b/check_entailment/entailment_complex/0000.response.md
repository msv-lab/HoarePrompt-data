Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. This is consistent with the problem description that specifies `n` should be a non-negative integer.

2. **Conversion and Summation**: Inside the function, `str(n)` converts the integer `n` into a string. Then, a generator expression `int(digit) for digit in str(n)` iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, converting each character back to an integer. Finally, the `sum()` function adds up all these integer values.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Zero**: When `n` is 0, `str(0)` is "0", and `int('0')` is 0. The sum is 0, which is correct.
   - **Single Digit**: For a single-digit number like 5, `str(5)` is "5", and `int('5')` is 5. The sum is 5, which is correct.
   - **Multiple Digits**: For a multi-digit number like 123, `str(123)` is "123". The generator expression converts "1" to 1, "2" to 2, and "3" to 3, and `sum([1, 2, 3])` results in 6, which is correct.

Since the function correctly handles all these cases and the logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, the function is correct.
