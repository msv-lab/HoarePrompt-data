You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of digits of the non-negative integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:Let's analyze the provided code and annotations step by step:

1. The function `func_1` takes a parameter `n`, which is specified to be a non-negative integer.
2. The return statement in the function uses a generator expression to convert each digit of `n` to an integer and sums them up.

From the code, we can see that:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- The function converts `n` to a string to iterate over each character (digit).
- Each character is converted to an integer.
- The integers are summed up and returned.

Given the annotations and the code, the function correctly performs the described operation without any missing functionality or edge cases that need special mention.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

**The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.**
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
