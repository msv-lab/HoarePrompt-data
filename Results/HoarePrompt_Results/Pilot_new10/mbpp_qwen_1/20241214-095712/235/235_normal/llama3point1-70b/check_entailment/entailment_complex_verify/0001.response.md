Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original implementation of the function `func_1` clearly show that it correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. This matches the problem description perfectly. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that would indicate the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
