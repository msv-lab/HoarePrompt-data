Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and then uses the `sum` function to add up these integers. This process yields the sum of the digits of the input number `n`. Since this matches the requirement of getting the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, the program is correct for all valid inputs.
