Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original explanation both accurately describe the function's behavior. The function correctly converts the non-negative integer to a string, iterates over each digit, converts it to an integer, and sums them up. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the annotations that the function fails to handle. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
