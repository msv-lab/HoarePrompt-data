Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. This approach handles all non-negative integers correctly without any missing logic or edge cases. For instance, it works for `n = 0` (returns 0), `n = 123` (returns 6), and larger numbers like `n = 9876543210` (returns 45). Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and the problem description does not specify any constraints or special cases beyond being a non-negative integer, the program is correct.
