Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The program uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the number (`n % 10`) and adds it to `total`, then removes the last digit from `n` using integer division (`n //= 10`). This process continues until `n` becomes 0. The given test cases also confirm its correctness:

- `func_1(345)` returns `12` because \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\).
- `func_1(12)` returns `3` because \(1 + 2 = 3\).
- `func_1(97)` returns `16` because \(9 + 7 = 16\).

Since the program handles the given examples correctly and the logic appears sound for any non-negative integer, the program is correct.
