Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning two lists where the first list contains the first `L` elements of the input list and the second list contains the remaining elements. This behavior matches the problem description for all potential valid cases, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`.
