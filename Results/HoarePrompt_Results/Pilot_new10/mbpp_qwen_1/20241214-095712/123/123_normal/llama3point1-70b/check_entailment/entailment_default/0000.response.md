Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(lst, L)` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` and splits the list into two parts. The first part contains the elements from the start of the list up to but not including the `L`-th element, and the second part contains the remaining elements from the `L`-th element to the end of the list. The function returns these two parts as a tuple.

Given the output hints, the function correctly handles all potential cases as long as \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). For any valid `L`, the slicing operations `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]` will produce the correct sublists. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
