The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L` such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). It returns two lists: the first list contains the elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the `L`-th element, and the second list contains the elements from the `L`-th element to the end of `lst`. This function correctly splits the list `lst` into two parts based on the index `L`.
