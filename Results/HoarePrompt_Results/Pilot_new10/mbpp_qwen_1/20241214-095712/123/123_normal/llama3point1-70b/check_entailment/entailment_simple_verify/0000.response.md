Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts as described, where the first part contains the first `L` elements, and the second part contains the remaining elements. The annotation accurately describes the behavior of the function, confirming that the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
