Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original program both correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the `L`-th element, and the second list contains elements from the `L`-th element to the end of `lst`. This is exactly what the problem description requires. The annotations also accurately reflect the behavior of the function and confirm that it meets the specified requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
