Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(lst, L)` correctly splits the list `lst` into two parts based on the index `L`. The first part contains elements from the start up to but not including `L`, and the second part contains elements from `L` to the end of the list. This matches the problem description and the output hints. The code handles all potential cases where \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\), as it correctly slices the list using the indices provided.
