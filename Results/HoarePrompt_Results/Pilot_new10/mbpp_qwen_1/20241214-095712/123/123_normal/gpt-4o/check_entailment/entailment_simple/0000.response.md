Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs. It then splits the list into two parts: the first part contains the first `L` elements of the list (`lst[:L]`), and the second part contains the remaining elements of the list (`lst[L:]`). These two parts are returned as a tuple.

The assertions provided in the code verify that the function behaves as expected for different input cases:
1. For `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3)`, the output is `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`.
2. For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2)`, the output is `(['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])`.
3. For `func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4)`, the output is `(['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])`.

In all cases, the function splits the list into two parts as required and returns them in a tuple, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
