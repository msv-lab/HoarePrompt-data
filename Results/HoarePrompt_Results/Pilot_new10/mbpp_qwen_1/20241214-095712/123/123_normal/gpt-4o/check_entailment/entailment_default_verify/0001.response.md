Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It splits the list into two parts based on the given integer `L` and returns them as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles valid inputs within the specified range (`0 <= L <= len(lst)`). Since the provided assertions cover different scenarios and the function behaves as expected, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
