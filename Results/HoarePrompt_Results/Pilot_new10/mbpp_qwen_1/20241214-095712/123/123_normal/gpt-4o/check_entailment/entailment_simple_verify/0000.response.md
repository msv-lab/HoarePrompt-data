Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly reflect that the function `func_1` splits the input list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and returns them as a tuple. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program before and after the function call, and the function behaves as expected in the provided test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
