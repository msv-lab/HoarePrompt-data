Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the index `L`. The examples provided in the annotations also demonstrate that the function works as expected for different types of inputs (integer and string lists). Since the function handles the specified cases correctly and the annotations confirm the behavior, the program is indeed correct according to the problem description.
