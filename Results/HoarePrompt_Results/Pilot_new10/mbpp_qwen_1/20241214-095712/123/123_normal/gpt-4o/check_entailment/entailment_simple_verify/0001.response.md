Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. The provided examples cover different scenarios, including lists with integers and lists with characters. The annotated code confirms that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
