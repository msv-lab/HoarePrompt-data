The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is an integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. The function returns a tuple containing two slices: `lst[:L]`, which is the slice of `lst` up to index `L`, and `lst[L:]`, which is the slice of `lst` starting from index `L`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L` such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, and returns a tuple containing two slices: `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`.**
