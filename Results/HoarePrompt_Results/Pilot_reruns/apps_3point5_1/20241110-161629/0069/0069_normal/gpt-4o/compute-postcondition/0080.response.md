According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n` in the range `(1, n + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, the `prefix_balances` list has been updated based on the given conditions. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2` based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1), and each element is updated based on the formula `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`**
