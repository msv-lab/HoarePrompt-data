Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, after the loop executes, data is a list with a length of at least index + 4, n is an integer value at index position + 3 in data, x is an integer value at index position + 4 in data, index is increased by 6, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 where each element prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1). If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the values of the variables remain unchanged. In addition, in the if part, if balance is 0, and x is in prefix_balances, results appends -1; otherwise, results appends 0. In the else part, if n >= 1, after the loop executes, data is a list with a length of at least index + 4, n is an integer value at index position + 3 in data, x is an integer value at index position + 4 in data, index is increased by 6, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 where each element prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), and count is assigned the value based on the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0. If n < 1, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
