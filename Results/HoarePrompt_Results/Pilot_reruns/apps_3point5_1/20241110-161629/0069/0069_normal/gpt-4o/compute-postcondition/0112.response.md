Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data for multiple test cases, processes each case to calculate certain results based on given conditions, and prints the results. It handles cases where the loop may not execute if `n` is 0 or negative, updates `prefix_balances` as the sum of balances from the binary string, and determines counts based on specific conditions. The function lacks explicit return values but prints the results of each test case.**
