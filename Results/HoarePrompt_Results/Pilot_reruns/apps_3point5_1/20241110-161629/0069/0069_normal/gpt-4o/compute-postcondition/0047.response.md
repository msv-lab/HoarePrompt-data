Output State: **`data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 4`, `n` is an integer value at index position + 4 in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 5 in `data`, `index` is increased by 6, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` where each element `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated based on the condition `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
