According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `n`. Since the loop is from 1 to n+1, it means n must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Given the initial state before the loop starts, the `data` list needs to have a length of at least `index + 4` (to accommodate values at index position, index position + 1, and index position + 3), `n` should be an integer value at index position + 3 in `data`, `x` should be an integer value at index position + 4 in `data`, `index` should be increased by 3 more to account for the loop iteration, and `prefix_balances` needs to be a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
State: **`data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 4`, `n` is an integer value at index position + 3 in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 4 in `data`, `index` is increased by 6, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**
