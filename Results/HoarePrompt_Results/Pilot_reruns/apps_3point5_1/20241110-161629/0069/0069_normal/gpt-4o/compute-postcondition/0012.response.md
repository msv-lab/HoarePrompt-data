According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `T` being greater than 0 does not affect the loop execution, so it remains the same. The initial value of `i` is specified as 1, so it needs to be adjusted to 1. The rest of the states need to be updated based on the values derived from the `data` list.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1**
