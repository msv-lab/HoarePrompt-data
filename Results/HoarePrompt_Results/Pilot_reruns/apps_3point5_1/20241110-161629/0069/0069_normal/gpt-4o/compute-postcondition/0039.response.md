Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is an integer. The value at the index position in `data` is assigned to `n`, and then `x` is assigned the value at the next index position in `data` as an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 1`, `n` is an integer value at index position in `data`; `x` is an integer value at index position + 1 in `data`.
Output State: **`data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 1`, `n` is an integer value at index position in `data`; `x` is an integer value at index position + 1 in `data`**
