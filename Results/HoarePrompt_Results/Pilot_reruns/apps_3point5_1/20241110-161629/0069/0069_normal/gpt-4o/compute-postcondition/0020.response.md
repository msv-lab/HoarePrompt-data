Example Answer:
The loop does not affect the execution of the code, but a new value of -1 is appended to the `results` list. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the characters in the string `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute and update the `prefix_balances` list accordingly. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros. A new value of -1 is appended to the `results` list.
