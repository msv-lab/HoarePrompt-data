According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 4`
- `n` is an integer value at index position + 3 in `data`
- `x` is an integer value at index position + 4 in `data`
- `index` is increased by 6
- `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, and `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated based on the previous values in the list `s` where 1 is added if `s[i - 1]` is '0' and -1 is added otherwise

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `n` needs to be increased by 1
- `prefix_balances` needs to be adjusted to have a length of `n + 1`

State: **`data` is a list with a length of at least `index + 4`, `n` is an integer value at index position + 4 in `data`, `x` is an integer value at index position + 5 in `data`, `index` is increased by 6, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**
