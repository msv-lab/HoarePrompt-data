Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space. Since the initial state does not specify the input values, the output state will depend on the actual values input by the user.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, _ is 0, n and x are assigned values based on user input**
