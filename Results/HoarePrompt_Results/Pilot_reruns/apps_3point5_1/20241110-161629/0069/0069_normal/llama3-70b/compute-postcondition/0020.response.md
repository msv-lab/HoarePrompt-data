Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, _ is 1, n, x, s are assigned values based on user input, cnt0 and cnt1 are updated counts of '0' and '1' in the user input string, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) divided by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1 is printed. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment execution.***
