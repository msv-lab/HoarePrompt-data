Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, _ is 1, n, x, s are assigned values based on user input, cnt0 and cnt1 are updated counts of '0' and '1' in the user input string, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) divided by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1 is printed. This covers all possible scenarios where the program fragment executes based on the given conditions and user input.***
