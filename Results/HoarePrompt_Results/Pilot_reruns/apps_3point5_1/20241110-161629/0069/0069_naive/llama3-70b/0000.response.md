Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles each test case by calculating the balance of the given string `s` and comparing it with the desired balance `x`. It then prints the number of prefixes or -1 if there is an infinite number of such prefixes. The logic seems correct and the program is able to determine the correct output for all the given test cases. Since all potential cases have been considered and the program meets the requirements mentioned in the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
