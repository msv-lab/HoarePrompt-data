Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not provide the expected output for all test cases.

One potential issue in the program is that it checks if the desired balance $x$ is in the list of prefix balances, however, this is not a correct way to determine if there are an infinite number of prefixes. The program also does not consider all possible cases where the balance can be achieved in the prefixes of $t$.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the correctness should be False.
