Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes and updates `prefix_balances` based on the sum of the previous element with 1 if the corresponding character in `s` is '0' and -1 if it's '1'. After the loop executes, `data`, `index`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances` will be updated accordingly. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the values of the variables remain the same as the initial state. In both cases, `results` list is appended with either -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, or 0 if it's not. Additionally, in the else part, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which the conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) are satisfied, and this value is stored in `results`.***
