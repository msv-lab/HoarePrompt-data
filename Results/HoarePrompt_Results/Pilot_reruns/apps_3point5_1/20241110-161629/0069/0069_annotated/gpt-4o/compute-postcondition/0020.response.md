Example Answer:
The loop does not execute when `n` is less than or equal to 0, so the value of `prefix_balances` list is not affected. The `results` list appends the value -1. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` list remains unchanged, `results` list now contains -1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` list remains unchanged, `results` list now contains -1**
