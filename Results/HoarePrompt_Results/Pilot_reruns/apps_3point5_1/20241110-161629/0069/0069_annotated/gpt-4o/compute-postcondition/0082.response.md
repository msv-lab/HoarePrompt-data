According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 4. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`data`, `n`, `T`, `x`, `s`, `index` remain the same or are updated, `balance` is calculated, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on the condition where the value at index 2 of string `s` is '0' or not**
