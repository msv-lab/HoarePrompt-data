Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 1, `s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list that calculates the running balance of '0's and '1's in `s`. If `balance` is 0, the loop appends -1 to `results` if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise, it appends 0. If `balance` is not 0, for each element `b` in `prefix_balances`, the loop increments `count` by 1 if the conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 are met. The final count value is appended to `results`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1.***
