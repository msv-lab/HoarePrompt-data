Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in the list. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, `count` is incremented by 1. The state of `prefix_balances` and `b` remains unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
