Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. If the previous value of `count` was `n`, the new value of `count` will be `n+1`. The list `prefix_balances` is not affected by this operation. The variable `b` is the second element in the list `prefix_balances`, so it remains the same. 
Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` is unchanged, `b` remains the same**
