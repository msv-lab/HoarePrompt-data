The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function will output the result of the test cases based on the constraints provided. The function will handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`, the length `n` of the binary string, and an integer `x` representing the desired balance. The function will calculate and return the count of steps required to achieve the desired balance `x` in the binary string `s` for each test case. The function will output the results for all test cases.
