Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the loop calculates the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in `s` is '0' and -1 if it's '1', storing the results in the `prefix_balances` list. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to the `results` list. Otherwise, 0 is appended to the `results` list.***
