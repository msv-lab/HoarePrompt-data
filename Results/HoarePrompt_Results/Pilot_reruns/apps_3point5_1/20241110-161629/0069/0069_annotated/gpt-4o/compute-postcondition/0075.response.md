Example Answer:
`prefix_balances` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The value of `n` could be any integer, so the length of `prefix_balances` could vary. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data`, `prefix_balances`, `n`, `T`, `x`, `s`, `index` remain the same or are updated based on the previous iteration. `balance` is calculated as the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`. `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
