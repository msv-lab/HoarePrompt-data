Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x. The code checks if x is present in the list of prefix balances to determine if there are an infinite number of such prefixes (outputting -1) or if there are no such prefixes (outputting 0). However, this logic is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases.

For example, consider the case where n = 1, x = 0, and s = "0". According to the problem description, there should be 1 prefix with a balance of 0, which is the empty string. However, the code will output 0 in this case because the balance of the string "0" is also 0, and x is not present in the list of prefix balances.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making the correctness of the code false.
