According to the code, the loop can execute if the number of test cases `T` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, T is an integer representing the number of test cases does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0. Additionally, since the loop is at the start, the index should be reset to 0 and the results list should be empty.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
