According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `prefix_balances`. If the list still has elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with the running balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `prefix_balances` is non-empty, the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with the running balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
