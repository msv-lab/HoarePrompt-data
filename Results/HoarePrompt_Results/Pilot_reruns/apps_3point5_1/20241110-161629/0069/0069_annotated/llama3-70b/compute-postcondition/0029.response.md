Postcondition: ***T + 1, n, x, s are user inputs, cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s, balance is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the program prints the result of the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. This covers all possible cases including the scenario where (cnt0 - cnt1) is zero, ensuring a comprehensive postcondition.***
