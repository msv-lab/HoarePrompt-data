Postcondition: ***T, n, x are integers greater than or equal to 0. s is the input value. cnt0 is the count of '0' in s. cnt1 is the count of '1' in s. balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, the function prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is 0, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. This postcondition covers all cases including the equality condition, exact division with zero remainder, and non-zero remainder cases.***
