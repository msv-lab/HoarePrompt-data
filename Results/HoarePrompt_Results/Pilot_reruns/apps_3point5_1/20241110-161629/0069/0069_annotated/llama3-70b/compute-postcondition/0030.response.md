Postcondition: ***T + 1, `n`, `x`, `s` are user inputs, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the program prints the result of the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. This postcondition accounts for all possible scenarios, including the edge case where (cnt0 - cnt1) equals zero.***
