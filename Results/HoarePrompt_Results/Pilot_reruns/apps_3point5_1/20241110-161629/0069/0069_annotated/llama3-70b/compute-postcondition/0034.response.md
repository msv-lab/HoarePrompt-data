Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input and then iterates `T` times to read values for `n`, `x`, and `s`. It calculates the balance between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s` and based on that balance, it prints different values. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If a certain condition involving `x`, balance, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` is met, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value based on a specific formula. The function handles different output scenarios depending on the calculated values.**
