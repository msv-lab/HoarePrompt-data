Example Answer: 
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 2, where `n` is an input integer and `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, the value of `remainder` will be either 0 or 1 based on the input value of `n`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the result of `n` modulo `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k+1`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo 2.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the result of `n` modulo `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k+1`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo 2**
