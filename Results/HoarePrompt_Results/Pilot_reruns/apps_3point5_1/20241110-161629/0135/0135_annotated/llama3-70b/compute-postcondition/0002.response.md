According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1 and will go up to `k` inclusive. Before the loop starts, you need to adjust the state so that `n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, and `seen` remains an empty set.
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
