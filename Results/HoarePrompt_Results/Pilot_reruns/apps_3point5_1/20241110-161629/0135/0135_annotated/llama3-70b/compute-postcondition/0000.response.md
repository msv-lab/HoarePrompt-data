Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts multiple inputs and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Since the initial state of `n` and `k` is not provided, the output state will be `n` and `k` are input integers.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers**
