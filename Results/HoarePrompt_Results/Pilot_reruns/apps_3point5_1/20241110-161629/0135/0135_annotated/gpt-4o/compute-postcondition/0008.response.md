Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of n % i, where n and i are not defined in the initial state. Since the initial state does not provide values for n and i, the output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer**
