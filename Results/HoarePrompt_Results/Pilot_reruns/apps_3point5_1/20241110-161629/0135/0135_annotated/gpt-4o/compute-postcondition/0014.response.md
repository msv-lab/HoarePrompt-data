The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Case_2: If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If `k` is greater than 0 and `n` is also greater than 0, the loop checks for duplicate remainders in the set `seen_remainders`. If a duplicate is found, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop adds the current remainder to `seen_remainders` until `i` reaches `k + 1.

Case_3: If `k` is less than or equal to 0, `seen_remainders` is an empty set. If `k` is greater than 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop checks for duplicate remainders in `seen_remainders` and adds the current remainder until `i` reaches `k + 1.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Depending on the conditions mentioned in the cases, the function may return 'No' or there will be no change in the state of the variables.**
