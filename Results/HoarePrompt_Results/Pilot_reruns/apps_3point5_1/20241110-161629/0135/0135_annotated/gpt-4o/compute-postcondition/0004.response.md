Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and assigns it to the variable `remainder`. The initial state does not provide values for `n` or `i`, so we cannot determine the specific value of `remainder`. Therefore, the output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer**
