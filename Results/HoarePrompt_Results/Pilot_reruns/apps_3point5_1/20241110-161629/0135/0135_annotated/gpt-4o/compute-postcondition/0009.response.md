According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is k + 1**
