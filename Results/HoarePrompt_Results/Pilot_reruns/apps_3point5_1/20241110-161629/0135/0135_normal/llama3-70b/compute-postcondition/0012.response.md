Postcondition: ***`seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the variables `seen`, `k`, `i`, and `remainder`.***
