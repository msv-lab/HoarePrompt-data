Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the result of `n % i`, where `n` is the current value and `i` is 3. The value of `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`. After calculation, the output state is: `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `remainder` is added to `seen`.
Output State: **`seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `remainder` is added to `seen`**
