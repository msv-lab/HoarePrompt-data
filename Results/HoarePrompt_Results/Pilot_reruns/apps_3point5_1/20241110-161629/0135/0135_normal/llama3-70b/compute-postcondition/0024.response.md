Functionality: **The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input and checks if there are any repeating remainders when `n` is divided by numbers from 1 to `k`. If a repeating remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The program handles cases where `k` is less than 1 or `n` is negative by not executing the loop.**
