According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i` where `n` is the initial value and `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `remainder` needs to be updated based on the new `i` value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % i` where `n` is the initial value and `i` is 3**
