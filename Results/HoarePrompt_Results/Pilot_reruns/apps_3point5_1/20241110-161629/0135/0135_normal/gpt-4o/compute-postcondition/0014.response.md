The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ n. 

After executing the function body:

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. This ensures the integrity of the variables n and k within the specified range.

Case_2: If `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. The loop checks if the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` is already in `seen_remainders` set. If it is, the function returns 'No'. After the loop finishes, `seen_remainders` contains unique remainders from the division of `n` by `i` where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute.

Case_3: If `k` is greater than 0 and the loop executes, the function returns 'Yes'. If `k` is 0 or negative and the loop does not execute, the function does not change the state.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, where n and k are within the specified range, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No' or 'Yes' accordingly.
