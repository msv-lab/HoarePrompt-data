Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ n. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. When k is greater than 0, the function iterates through values from 1 to k, storing remainders of n divided by i in a set. If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without duplicates and k is positive, the function returns 'Yes'. In cases where k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the function does not change the state.**
