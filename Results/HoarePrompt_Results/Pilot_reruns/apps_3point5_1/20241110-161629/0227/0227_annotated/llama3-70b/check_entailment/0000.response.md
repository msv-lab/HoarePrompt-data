Correctness: **True**

Based on the problem description and the annotations, the code provided correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. The code sorts the input list of integers and then iterates through the elements to check if each element is equal to twice the previous element. If not, it increments the variable `m`. Finally, the code prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1.

The code handles the given problem statement by checking each element in the sorted list to ensure that it follows the condition specified in the problem description. The annotations provide a clear explanation of what each part of the code does, and there are no potential cases mentioned that the code does not cover. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the approach taken by the code.

Therefore, the code is correct and provides the expected output as per the problem description.
