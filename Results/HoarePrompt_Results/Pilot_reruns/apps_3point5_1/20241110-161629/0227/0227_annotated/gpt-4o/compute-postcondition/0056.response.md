According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one more element in `assigned` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` still has at least one more element to iterate over. No changes need to be made to the variables for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`assigned` still has at least one more element to iterate over**
