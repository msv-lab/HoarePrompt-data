Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state is `assigned` still has at least one more element to iterate over, `can_form` is True.
Output State: **`assigned` still has at least one more element to iterate over, `can_form` is True**
