Output State: **If `assigned` contains at least one element and `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `i` elements of `a`, `m` is either 1 or 2 based on the condition, `i` is 2, `x` is the `i-th` element of `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty or `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, the loop will not execute and `can_form` will remain False.**
