Output State: **If `assigned` is not empty and the loop finds a difference between `a[i]` and `x` present in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, and the loop breaks. If the condition is not met for any iteration, `can_form` remains False, `m` stays unchanged, and `x` progresses through each element in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. After the execution of the if else block, the final state includes the updated values of `can_form`, `m`, and `x` based on the conditions met during the loop execution.**
