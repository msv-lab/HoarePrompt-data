According to the code, the loop will execute again if `can_form` is False at the end of the previous iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True if a[i] - x is found in `assigned`, otherwise False. Since the loop terminates after setting `can_form` to True, for the loop to execute one more time, it means `can_form` should still be False at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False**
