The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` distinct positive integers. The function returns three values:
1. `m`, which is the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by a pair of assigned elements.
2. `assigned`, which contains elements from `a` that can be formed by a pair.
3. `can_form`, which indicates if the current element can be formed by a pair in `assigned`.

Additionally, `i` iterates over elements in `a`, and `x` iterates over elements in `assigned`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and then determine the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by a pair of assigned elements, identify elements from `a` that can be formed by a pair, and indicate if each element in `a` can be formed by a pair in `assigned`.
