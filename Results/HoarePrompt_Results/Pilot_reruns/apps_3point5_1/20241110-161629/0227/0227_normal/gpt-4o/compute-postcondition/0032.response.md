Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the first 'm+2' elements of list `a`, where `m` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 1, and there are still elements left in the `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
