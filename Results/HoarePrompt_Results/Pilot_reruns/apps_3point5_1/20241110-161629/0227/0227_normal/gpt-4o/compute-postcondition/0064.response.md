The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `a`. The precondition is that `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of distinct positive integers. After executing the function body, the variable `assigned` contains the first 'm+n' elements of list `a`, where `m` is incremented by 1 if `can_form` was initially False, remains unchanged if `can_form` was initially True or `assigned` is empty, and `n` is less than or equal to 1. The variable `can_form` is True if the condition `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned` for any 'x' in `assigned`. The loop in the function may or may not execute, and the function returns the final value of `m`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of distinct positive integers. The function processes the list `a` and updates the value of `m` based on certain conditions, finally returning the updated value of `m`.**
