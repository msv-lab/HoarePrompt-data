Output State: **`assigned` contains the first 'm' elements of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True if the condition `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned` for any 'x' in `assigned`. If the condition is satisfied, the loop is terminated. If `assigned` is empty or does not have the necessary elements to satisfy the condition, `can_form` remains False.**
