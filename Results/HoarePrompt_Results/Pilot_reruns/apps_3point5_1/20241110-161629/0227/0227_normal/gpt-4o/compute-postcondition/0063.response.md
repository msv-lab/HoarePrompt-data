Output State: **`assigned` contains the first 'm+n' elements of list `a`, `m` is incremented by 1 if `can_form` was initially False, remains unchanged if `can_form` was initially True or `assigned` is empty, and `n` is less than or equal to 1, and `can_form` is True if the condition `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned` for any 'x' in `assigned`. The loop may or may not execute, and the function returns the final value of `m`.**
