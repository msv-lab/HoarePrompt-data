The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and a, where n is a positive integer and a is a list of distinct positive integers. It then processes the list a to determine the minimum number of elements needed to form all possible differences between elements in the list. The function returns the final value of m, which represents the minimum number of elements required to form all possible differences. If n is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute.
