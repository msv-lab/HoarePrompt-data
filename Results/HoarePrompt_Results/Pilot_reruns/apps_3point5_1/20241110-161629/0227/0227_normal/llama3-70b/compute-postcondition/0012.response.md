Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is equal to the value after the last iteration + 1. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to twice the value of the element at index `i - 1`, then `m` is increased by 1. The program state remains consistent with the initial conditions, ensuring the integrity of the variables.***
