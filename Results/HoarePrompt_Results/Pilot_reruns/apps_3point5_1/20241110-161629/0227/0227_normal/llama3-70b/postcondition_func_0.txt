The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` representing the length of a sequence, followed by a list of integers. It sorts the list, then iterates through the list to find the longest increasing subsequence where each element is twice the previous element. The function then prints the length of this subsequence if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The code does not handle cases where the input constraints are violated, such as duplicate integers or non-distinct positive integers.
