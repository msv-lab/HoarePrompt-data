Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The length of the sequence is represented by `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 23. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23 representing the length of the sequence, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23 representing the length of the sequence, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
