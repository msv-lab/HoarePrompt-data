According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are the lengths of `d_queue` and `r_queue`.

State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_index` is incremented by `n` and added to `d_queue`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_index` remains unchanged and the length of `r_queue` increases by 1, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty**
