Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. The length of `d_queue` decreases by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1, and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue` or `r_queue based on the conditions mentioned above, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1, and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue` or `r_queue based on the conditions mentioned above, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`**
