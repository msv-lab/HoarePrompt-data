According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the states of `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, the length of `r_queue` either decreases by 1 and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue`, or increases by 1 and the appropriate value is appended to `r_queue` based on the conditions mentioned above, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`. For the loop to execute one more time, `d_queue` and `r_queue` both need to be non-empty.
State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, the length of `r_queue` either decreases by 1 and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue`, or increases by 1 and the appropriate value is appended to `r_queue`, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue` and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty**
