Output State: **The loop iterates through the string `votes` and appends the index `i` to either `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the character in the `votes` string at that index. If the loop doesn't execute, `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` contains the indices of employees who voted 'D', and `r_queue` contains the indices of employees who voted 'R'.**
