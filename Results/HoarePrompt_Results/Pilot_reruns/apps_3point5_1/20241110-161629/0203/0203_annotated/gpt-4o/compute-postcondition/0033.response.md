Example Answer:
`r_queue` appends `r_index + n` where `n` is the number of employees. The length of `r_queue` increases by 1, and the value `r_index + n` is added to the end of `r_queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, the length of `r_queue` increases by 1, and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue` or `r_queue based on the conditions mentioned above, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, the length of `r_queue` increases by 1, and the appropriate value is appended to `d_queue` or `r_queue based on the conditions mentioned above, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`**
