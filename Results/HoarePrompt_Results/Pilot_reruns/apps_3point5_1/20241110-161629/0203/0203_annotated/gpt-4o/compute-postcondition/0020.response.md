Example Answer:
`d_index` is incremented by `n` and added to `d_queue`. The value of `d_index` is unknown, and `d_queue` may be empty or have some indices. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` may be empty or have some indices, `r_queue` contains the indices of employees who voted 'R', `d_index` is incremented by `n`, `r_index` is the index of the first employee who voted 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` may be empty or have some indices, `r_queue` contains the indices of employees who voted 'R', `d_index` is incremented by `n`, `r_index` is the index of the first employee who voted 'R'**
