Example Answer:
`r_queue` is initialized as an empty list, and `d_queue` is not affected. The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list**
