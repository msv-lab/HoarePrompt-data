Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` is not empty, a value is popped, and `d_index` will be updated accordingly. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` remains unchanged, the length of `r_queue` increases by 1.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` remains unchanged, the length of `r_queue` increases by 1**
