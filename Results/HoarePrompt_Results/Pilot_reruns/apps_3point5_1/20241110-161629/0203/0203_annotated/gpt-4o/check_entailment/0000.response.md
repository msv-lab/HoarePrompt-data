Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the voting process described in the problem description. It assigns employees to either the 'D' or 'R' queue based on their vote, then simulates the voting process until one queue becomes empty. The winner is determined based on the last employee who voted, and the correct outcome ('D' or 'R') is printed accordingly.

The code annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points and explain the logic behind processing the votes. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the correct outcome is determined based on the voting process. Since there are no examples or potential cases provided where the code does not work as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct based on the problem description and examples given.
