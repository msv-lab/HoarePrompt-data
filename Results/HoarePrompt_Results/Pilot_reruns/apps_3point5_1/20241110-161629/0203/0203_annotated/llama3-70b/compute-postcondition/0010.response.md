Example Answer:
The number of 'remocrats' is increased by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`, and 'remocrats' is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`, 'remocrats' is increased by 1**
