Example Answer:
`depublicans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`, and `depublicans` is increased by 1**
