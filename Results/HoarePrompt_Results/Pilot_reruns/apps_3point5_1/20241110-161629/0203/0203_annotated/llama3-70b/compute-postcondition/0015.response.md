Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1. If `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is incremented by 1. Both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are adjusted based on the next fraction in `fractions`.***
