Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`. If the next fraction is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1. If the next fraction is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1. This logic covers all possible cases for the fractions 'D' and 'R' in the program.***
