According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more fractions left in the `fractions` string. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`. If the next fraction is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1. If the next fraction is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since there is at least one more fraction left in the `fractions` string, `fractions` should still have at least one more fraction left.
- The next fraction in `fractions` will be the current `fraction` processed in the previous iteration.
- If the next fraction is 'D', then `depublicans` should be increased by 1.
- If the next fraction is not 'D', then `remocrats` should be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`, `depublicans` and `remocrats` adjusted based on the next fraction in `fractions`.**
