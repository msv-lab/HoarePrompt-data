Example Answer:
The value of `d_index` is added to `n` and appended to `d_queue`. The previous values of `n`, `d_queue`, `r_queue`, and `r_index` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` including the new appended value, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`, `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue`.
Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` including the new appended value, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`, `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue`**
