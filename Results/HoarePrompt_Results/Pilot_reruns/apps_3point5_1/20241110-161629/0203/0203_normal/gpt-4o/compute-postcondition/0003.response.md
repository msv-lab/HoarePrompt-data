Example Answer:
r_queue is assigned an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats; d_queue is an empty list; r_queue is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats; d_queue is an empty list; r_queue is an empty list**
