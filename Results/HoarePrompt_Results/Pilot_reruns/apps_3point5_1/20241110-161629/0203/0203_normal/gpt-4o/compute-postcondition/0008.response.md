According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `votes` string to enumerate. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, and `v` is the first character in the `votes` string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `votes` string should still have characters left after the first character has been enumerated. So, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string**
