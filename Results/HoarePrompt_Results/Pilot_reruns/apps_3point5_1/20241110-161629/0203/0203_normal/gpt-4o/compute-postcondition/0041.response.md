Functionality: **The function accepts user input for the number of employees and their corresponding votes as 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats. It then calculates the minimum number of employees needed to change their vote to achieve a majority vote for either depublicans or remocrats. The function handles cases where both parties have equal votes and outputs the party that needs fewer vote changes to win.**
