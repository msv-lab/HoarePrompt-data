Example Answer: 
The code initializes an empty list `d_queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` representing the number of employees and `votes` containing the party affiliations. The `d_queue` list is now empty. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats; d_queue is an empty list**
