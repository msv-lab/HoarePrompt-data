Output State: If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes`. If `n` is 0, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty as the loop does not execute. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the beginning of `d_queue`. After executing the code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)`, the value at index 0 is removed from `r_queue` and assigned to `r_index. `d_queue` is appended with the value `d_index + n`.
