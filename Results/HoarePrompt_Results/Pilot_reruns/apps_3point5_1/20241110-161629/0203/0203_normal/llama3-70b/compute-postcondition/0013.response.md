Example Answer:
`depublicans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is 1 (as 'D' is the next fraction), so after execution, `depublicans` becomes 2. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 2, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 2, `remocrats` is 0**
