Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer. If the next fraction is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1 and becomes 1, while `remocrats` remains 0. If the next fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1 and becomes 1, while `depublicans` remains 0. The program correctly handles both cases where the next fraction is 'D' and when it is not 'D', ensuring the counts of 'D' and non-'D' fractions are updated accordingly.***
