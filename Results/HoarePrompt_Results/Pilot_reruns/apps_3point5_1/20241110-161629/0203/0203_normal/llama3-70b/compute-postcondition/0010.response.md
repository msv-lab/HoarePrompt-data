Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1**
