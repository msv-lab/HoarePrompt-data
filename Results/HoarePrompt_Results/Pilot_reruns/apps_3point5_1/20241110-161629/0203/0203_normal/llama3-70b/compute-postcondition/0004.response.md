According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being an input integer does not directly impact the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states such that `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, and `fraction` is the first fraction in the `fractions` list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first fraction in the `fractions` list**
