Example Answer:
Since the initial state mentions that if the next fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is 1, and `depublicans` is 0, and the code snippet increments the value of `remocrats` by 1, after execution, `remocrats` will be 2, and `depublicans` will remain 0.
Output State: **If the next fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is 2, `depublicans` is 0**
