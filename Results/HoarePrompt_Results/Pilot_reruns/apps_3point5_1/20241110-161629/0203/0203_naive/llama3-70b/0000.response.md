Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly follows the problem description. It iterates through the fractions of the employees and counts the number of depublicans and remocrats. Then it compares the counts and prints the appropriate outcome. The program handles the voting process as described, where employees can deny others from voting until only one employee is left to determine the outcome. The logic of comparing the counts of depublicans and remocrats to determine the outcome is correct. All possible cases are considered in the program logic and it provides the correct output.
