Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly initializes empty queues for depublicans and remocrats.
2. It then iterates through the votes and adds the index of the employee to the respective queue based on their fraction.
3. The program then simulates the voting process by popping the first employee from each queue and comparing their indices.
4. If a depublican employee's index is less than a remocrat employee's index, the depublican employee's index is added to the end of the depublican queue, simulating the denial of voting rights to the remocrat employee.
5. If a remocrat employee's index is less than a depublican employee's index, the remocrat employee's index is added to the end of the remocrat queue, simulating the denial of voting rights to the depublican employee.
6. This process continues until one of the queues is empty, at which point the program prints the respective outcome ('D' or 'R').

The program correctly follows the rules of the voting process as described in the problem description, ensuring that each employee takes their turn to make a statement and potentially deny another employee's voting rights.
