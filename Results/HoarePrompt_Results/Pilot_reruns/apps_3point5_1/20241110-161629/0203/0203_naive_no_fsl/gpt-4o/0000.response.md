Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly follows the problem description and logic provided. It maintains queues for depublicans and remocrats, then iterates through the queues, denying voting rights to the employee with the lower index. It keeps track of the index by adding 'n' to it if needed. Finally, it prints the outcome based on which queue still has elements. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and works correctly for all inputs.
