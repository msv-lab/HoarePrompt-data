Output State: **`block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` remain unchanged. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the provided formula. `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The function returns `total_time`.**
