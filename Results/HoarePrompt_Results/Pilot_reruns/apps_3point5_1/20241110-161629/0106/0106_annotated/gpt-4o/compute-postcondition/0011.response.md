The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The preconditions state that `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n·m·k. 

After executing the function body, `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` remain unchanged. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on a provided formula. `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculate `time_to_target_floor` based on a formula, calculate `total_time` as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, and return `total_time`.
