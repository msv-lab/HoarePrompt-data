Example Answer:
The value of `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `floor_b` is subtracted by 1 and then multiplied by 5. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` are determined based on the initial values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, and `n`; `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided.
