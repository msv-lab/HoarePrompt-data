Postcondition: ***`n, m, k` are positive integers within the specified range; `a, b` are input integers; `a_floor` is the floor value of `a` within the range of 1 to `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the provided values of `a`, `m`, and `k`; `b_floor` is the calculated value based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is the calculated value based on the formula provided; `min_block_time` is the minimum block time calculated based on the formula provided; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `k`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is set to `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `b_floor` is greater than or equal to `a_floor`, `min_floor_time` is set to `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
