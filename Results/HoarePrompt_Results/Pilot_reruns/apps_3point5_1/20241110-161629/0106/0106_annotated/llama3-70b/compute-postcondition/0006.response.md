Example Answer:
The code calculates the minimum block time based on the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, and the remaining time until `n`. The initial state provides values for `a`, `b`, `m`, `k`, and `n`. Using these values, the formula for `a_floor` and `b_floor`, and the formula for `a_block`, `b_block`, the minimum block time is calculated. 
Output State: **`n, m, k are positive integers within the specified range, a is the first input integer, b is the second input integer; a_floor is the floor value of a within the range of 1 to m; a_block is calculated based on the provided values of a, m, and k, b_floor is the calculated value based on the formula (b - 1) % m + 1; b_block is the calculated value based on the formula provided; min_block_time is the minimum block time calculated based on the formula provided`**
