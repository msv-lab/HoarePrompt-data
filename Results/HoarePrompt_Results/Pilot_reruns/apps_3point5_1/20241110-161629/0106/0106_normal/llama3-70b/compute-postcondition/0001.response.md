Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers**
