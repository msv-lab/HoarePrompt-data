The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The `apartment` parameter represents a positive integer. The function calculates the `block` number based on the equation provided. The `floor_within_block` is calculated as `floor_within_block = apartment % (n * m)`. Finally, the `floor` is determined based on the equation `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to calculate the block number and the floor within that block based on the given apartment number. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, calculates the block number and the floor within that block based on the given apartment number.**
