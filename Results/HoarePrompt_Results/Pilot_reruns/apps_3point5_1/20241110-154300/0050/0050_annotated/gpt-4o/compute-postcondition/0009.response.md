Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, 1 <= n, m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, `max_shares` is the result of integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the result of the modulus operation of `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. The output prints the value of `total_bourles`.**
