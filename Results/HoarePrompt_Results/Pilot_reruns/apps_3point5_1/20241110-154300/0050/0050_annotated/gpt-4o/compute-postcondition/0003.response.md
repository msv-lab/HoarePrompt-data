Example Answer:
The variable `min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value from the list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`**
