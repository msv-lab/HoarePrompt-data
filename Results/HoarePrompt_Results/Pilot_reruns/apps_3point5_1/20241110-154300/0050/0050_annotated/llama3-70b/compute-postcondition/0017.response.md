Example Answer: 
`shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, where `s` is a list of integers. The previous value of `shares` is unknown, but `r` is between 1 and 1000, and `s[i]` is an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 30, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `shares` is increased by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `shares` is increased by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`**
