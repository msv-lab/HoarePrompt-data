Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is updated based on the conditions, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `s` is a list of integers. If shares > 0, `r` is increased by the product of shares and the element in `b` at index i, shares is set to 0. If shares <= 0, the loop is terminated. In either case, `r` is updated based on the conditions.***
