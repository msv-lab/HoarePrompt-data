Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, `r` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers inputted by the user.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers inputted by the user**
