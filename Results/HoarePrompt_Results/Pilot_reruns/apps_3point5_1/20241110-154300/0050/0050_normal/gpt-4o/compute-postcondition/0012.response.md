Functionality: **The function `func` takes input from the user for positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, followed by lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, any remaining amount of money after buying the maximum number of shares, and the total amount of money after selling those shares. It then prints the total amount of money. The function does not return any value.**
