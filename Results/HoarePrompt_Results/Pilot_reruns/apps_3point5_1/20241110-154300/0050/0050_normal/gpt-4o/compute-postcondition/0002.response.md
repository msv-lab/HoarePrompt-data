Example Answer:
The input is taken as a string, split by spaces, and converted into a list of integers stored in variable `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions; `b` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions; `b` is a list of integers**
