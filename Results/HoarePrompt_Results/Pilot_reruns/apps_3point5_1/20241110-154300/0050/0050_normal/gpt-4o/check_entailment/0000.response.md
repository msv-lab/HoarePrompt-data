Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code correctly takes input for the number of ways to buy shares, sell shares, and the initial amount of money.
2. It then calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price from the input lists.
3. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial amount of money, which is correct.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial amount of money, any remaining amount after buying shares, and the total amount after selling those shares.
5. The code then prints the total amount of money after selling shares, which is the maximum number of bourles one can hold after the evening.
6. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code's logic.
