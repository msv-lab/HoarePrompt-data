Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the program prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is calculated as the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` added to `remaining_bourles`, and the program prints `total_bourles`, where `total_bourles` is a positive integer.***
