Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `b`, `s`, `i` are positive integers. List `b` is sorted in descending order, list `s` is sorted in ascending order. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and the element at index `i` in list `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the loop. All variables retain their initial values except for `r` and `shares` as described above.***
