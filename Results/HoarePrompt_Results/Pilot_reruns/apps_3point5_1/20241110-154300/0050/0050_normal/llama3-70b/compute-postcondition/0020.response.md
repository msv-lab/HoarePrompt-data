Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers. `b` is sorted in descending order, `s` is sorted in ascending order. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], then shares is updated by adding the division of r by the element at index i in s. r is then assigned the remainder of r divided by the element at index i in s. The index i is incremented by 1. If r is less than s[i], the loop breaks. `i` is one more than the previous iteration. If r >= s[i], the shares and r are updated based on the division and remainder respectively. If r < s[i], the loop breaks and the index i is incremented.***
