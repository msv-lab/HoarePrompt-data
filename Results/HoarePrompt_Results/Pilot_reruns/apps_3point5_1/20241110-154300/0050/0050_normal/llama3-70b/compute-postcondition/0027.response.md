Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers. `b` is sorted in descending order, `s` is sorted in ascending order, `shares` is either 0 or the result of the calculation based on the if statement, `i` is 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of shares and b[i], and shares is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is not greater than 0, the loop or if statement is exited.***
