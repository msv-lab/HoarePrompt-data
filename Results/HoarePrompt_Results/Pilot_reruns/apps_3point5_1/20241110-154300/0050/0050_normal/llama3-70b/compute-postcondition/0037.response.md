Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `b` is sorted in descending order, `s` is sorted in ascending order, `i` is a positive integer less than `m+1`. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and the element at index `i` in list `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, no changes occur in the variables as the code breaks out of the loop.***
