Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `numerator` is the product of 2 raised to the power of `n` and the difference between `total_days` and `k`, `denominator` is the product of 2 raised to the power of `n` and `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, `i` is `k - 1`. If k is equal to or less than 0, the loop does not execute and `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is `k - 1`**.
