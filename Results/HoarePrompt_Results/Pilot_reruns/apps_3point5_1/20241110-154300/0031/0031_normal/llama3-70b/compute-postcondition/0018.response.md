The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, `numerator` is updated after division by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated after floor division by `gcd`, `i` and `gcd` remain unchanged, and the function returns the remainder of `numerator` divided by 10. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, update `numerator` and `denominator` based on division by `gcd`, keep `i` and `gcd` unchanged, and return the remainder of `numerator` divided by 10. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, updates numerator and denominator based on division by gcd, keeps i and gcd unchanged, and returns the remainder of numerator divided by 10.**
