The code multiplies the `denominator` by `total_days` and then calculates the modulo of the result with `MOD`. Given that `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, and all other variables are updated, the `denominator` is also updated accordingly.

Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
