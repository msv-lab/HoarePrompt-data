Example Answer:
`p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The values of `p_total`, `p_no_shared`, and `MOD` are not provided, so the output state is `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated using the given formula.
Output State: **`p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated using the formula**
