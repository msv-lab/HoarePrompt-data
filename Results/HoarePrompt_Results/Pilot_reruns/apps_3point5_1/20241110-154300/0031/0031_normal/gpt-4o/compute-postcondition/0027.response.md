The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints are that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 2 <= k <= 10^18. After executing the function body, if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n bits, the function prints 1 and returns. Otherwise, no changes occur to the program state. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n bits, it prints 1 and returns. Otherwise, no changes occur to the program state.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n bits, it prints 1 and returns. Otherwise, no changes occur to the program state.**
