Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `numerator` will be updated according to the calculations, `denominator` will be updated according to the calculations, `i` will be equal to k-1, `MOD` will remain 1000003, `total_days` will remain 1 shifted left by `n` bits. If k is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute, and `numerator` and `denominator` will remain 1, `i` will be 0.**
