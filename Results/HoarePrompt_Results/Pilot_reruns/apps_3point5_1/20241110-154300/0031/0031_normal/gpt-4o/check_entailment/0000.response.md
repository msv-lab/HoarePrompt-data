Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code seems to correctly address the problem description of calculating the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) between two integers, ensuring that the output values are coprime.
- The function `func_2` properly handles the cases where `k` is greater than the total number of days in a year, printing `1, 1` as expected. 
- For other cases, it calculates the probabilities and outputs the irreducible fraction modulo 10^6 + 3, which aligns with the problem description.
- The output hints also confirm the behavior of the code and do not indicate any potential discrepancies between the code and the problem description.
