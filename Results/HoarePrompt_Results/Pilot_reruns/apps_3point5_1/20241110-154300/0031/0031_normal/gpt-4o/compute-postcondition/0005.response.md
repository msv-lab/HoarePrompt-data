Example Answer: 
`numerator` is assigned the value `1`. Other variables are not affected. Since the value of `numerator` is 1, the output state is MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n bits, numerator is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n bits, numerator is 1**
