According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is 2 raised to the power of n, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is a valid integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.
State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
