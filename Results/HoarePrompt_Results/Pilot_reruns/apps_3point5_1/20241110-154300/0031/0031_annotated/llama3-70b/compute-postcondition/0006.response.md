According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2^n, `denominator` is equal to the updated value after multiplying by `total_days`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 since it is the loop variable. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2^n, `denominator` is equal to the updated value after multiplying by `total_days`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
