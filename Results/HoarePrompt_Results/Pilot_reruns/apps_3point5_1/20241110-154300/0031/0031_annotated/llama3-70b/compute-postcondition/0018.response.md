The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, `numerator` is the result of numerator divided by gcd, `denominator` is updated after floor division, and `gcd` remains the same. The function then returns the value of `numerator` % (10. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, perform calculations on them to update `numerator`, `denominator`, and `gcd`, and finally return the remainder of `numerator` divided by 10.
