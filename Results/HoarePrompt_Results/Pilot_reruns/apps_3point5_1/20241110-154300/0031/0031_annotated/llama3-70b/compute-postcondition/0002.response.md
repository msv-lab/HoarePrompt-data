Example Answer:
`denominator` is assigned the value 1. The values of `total_days` and `numerator` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1.
Output State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
