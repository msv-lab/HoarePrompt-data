Example Answer: 
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by the result of `total_days - i`. Since `total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, and `i` is 0, `total_days - i` is equal to `2^n`. Therefore, `numerator` is multiplied by `2^n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2^n, `denominator` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
