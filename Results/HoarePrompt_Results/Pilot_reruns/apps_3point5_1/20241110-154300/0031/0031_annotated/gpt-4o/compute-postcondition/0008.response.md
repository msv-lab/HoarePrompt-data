Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying the previous value of `numerator` with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The previous value of `numerator` is 1, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `i` is 0, and `MOD` remains 1000003. Therefore, the new value of `numerator` is 1 * (2^n - 0) % 1000003. 
Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is (2^n) % 1000003, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
