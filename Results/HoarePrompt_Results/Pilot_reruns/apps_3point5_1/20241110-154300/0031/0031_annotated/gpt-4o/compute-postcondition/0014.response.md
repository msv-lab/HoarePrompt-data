Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated to a new value based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` remains the same as `denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is 2, `denominator` is updated to a new value after the calculation `denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD`**
