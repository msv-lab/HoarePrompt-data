According to the code, the loop will execute `k` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`MOD` remains 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
