Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation `denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
