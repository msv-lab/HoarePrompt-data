Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, it calculates the values of numerator and denominator in a loop, then computes p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared, A, B, and g based on those values. Finally, it updates A and B by performing floor division with g, and prints the values of A % MOD and B % MOD. The function does not return any value, and the variables MOD, n, and k remain unchanged throughout the execution.**
