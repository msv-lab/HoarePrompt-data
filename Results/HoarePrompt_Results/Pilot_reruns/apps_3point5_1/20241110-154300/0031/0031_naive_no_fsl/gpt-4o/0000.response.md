Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a given scenario as described in the problem statement.
2. The program handles large values of n and k by using modulo arithmetic.
3. The program uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor and ensures that A and B are coprime before printing the final result.
4. The program correctly handles the edge case when k is greater than 2^n as specified in the problem description.
