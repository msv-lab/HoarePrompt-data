Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The program follows the problem description by taking the input values, calculating the required number of seconds using the given formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2), and then printing the result. 

The formula accounts for the fact that in each second, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle to obtain the desired equilateral triangle of side length y. The program ensures that the length of each side remains an integer throughout the process. 

After reviewing the problem description and the provided code, it can be concluded that the program handles all potential cases correctly and produces the expected output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
