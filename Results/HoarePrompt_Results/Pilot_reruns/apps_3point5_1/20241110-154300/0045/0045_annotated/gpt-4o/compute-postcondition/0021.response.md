According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, and `remainder` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program execution stops. In all other cases, the program continues and `remainder` is decreased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to 1 (since the loop decrements by 1 each iteration). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `remainder` is positive, `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
