Output State: 
If `remainder` is 0 before the loop starts, the loop will not execute. In this case, `sequence` remains unchanged, and `remainder` is equal to 0. 
If `remainder` is not 0 before the loop starts, the loop will execute until `remainder` becomes 0. After the loop executes, `n` and `k` remain positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. If `remainder` becomes 0 during the loop execution, the loop breaks. `sequence` values may change based on the loop iterations. 
Output State: **If remainder is 0 before the loop starts, sequence remains unchanged, and remainder is 0. If remainder is not 0 before the loop starts, sequence values may change, and remainder becomes 0 after the loop executes.**
