The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is true (non-zero) and `b` is non-zero, the new value of `a` is 1 (true) % (non-zero), which remains 1 (true). The new value of `b` is the previous value of `a`, which is true (non-zero).

Output State: **`a` is true (non-zero), `b` is true (non-zero)**
