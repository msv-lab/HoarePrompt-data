Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of the subtraction, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `k - 1. If the remainder after the subtraction is 0, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues execution based on the current state of variables.**
