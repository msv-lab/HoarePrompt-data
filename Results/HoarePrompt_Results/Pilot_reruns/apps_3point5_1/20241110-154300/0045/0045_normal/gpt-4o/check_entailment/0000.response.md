Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two positive integers `n` and `k`, and first calculates the minimum sum possible for a sequence of `k` numbers (`min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`). If this minimum sum is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the sequence based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The sequence is constructed in a way that the sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximized. The code also handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than 1 by not executing the loop and maintaining the initial values. Additionally, the code correctly adjusts the sequence to include any remainder after the initial calculation, ensuring that the sum is exact.

Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and provides a valid solution for all potential cases.
