Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b` while `b` is assigned the value of `a % b` where `b` is not equal to 0. After the swap and modulo operation, the new values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the initial values of `a` and `b`. 
Output State: **New values of `a` and `b` after the swap and modulo operation**
