The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It then iteratively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0. The final value of `a` after the iterations is returned as the result. The function accurately implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.
