Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic to generate a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n. It iterates from 1 to k and appends the numbers to the sequence while decrementing n by the current number. If n becomes less than the next number to be added, it breaks the loop. If the sequence length is not equal to k at the end, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence. 
The code also handles the case when n < k and prints -1 in that scenario. The implementation seems to align with the problem description and provides a valid solution for the given problem.
