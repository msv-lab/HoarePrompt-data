Output State: **If b is not 0, the loop will keep executing. After 1 iteration: a is the initial value of b, and b is the remainder of a divided by the initial b value. After 2 iterations: a is the initial b value, and b is the remainder of the initial a value divided by the initial b value. After 3 iterations: a is the initial value of b, and b is the remainder of the initial b value divided by the second a value. The loop will continue until b becomes 0. If b is initially 0, the loop will not execute.**
