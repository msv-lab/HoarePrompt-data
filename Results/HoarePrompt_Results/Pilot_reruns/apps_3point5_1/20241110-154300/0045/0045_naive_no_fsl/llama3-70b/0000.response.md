Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of n and k.
2. It then checks if n is less than k, in which case it outputs -1 which is correct according to the problem description.
3. The program then proceeds to create a sequence of k positive numbers that sum up to n and are strictly increasing.
4. The program achieves this by iterating from 1 to k, adding each number to the sequence and subtracting it from n.
5. If the length of the sequence is not equal to k at the end, it outputs -1 which is also correct.
6. Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence as required.
7. The program handles cases where the answer does not exist by outputting -1.
8. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and it covers all possible cases, making it correct.
