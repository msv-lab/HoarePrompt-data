Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data consisting of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` with at most 10^6 digits. It then compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, it prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. There are missing cases in the annotations where the behavior of the code does not align with the described postconditions.**
