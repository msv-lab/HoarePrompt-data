Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. Regardless of the comparison result, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains '0' after the execution of the if-else block.***
