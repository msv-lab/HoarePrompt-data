Example Answer:
The `input().split()` function reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a` and `b`, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **a and b are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits**
