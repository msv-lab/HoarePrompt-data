Functionality: ** The function `func` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` represented as strings with up to 10^6 digits as input. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The function does not have a specified return value. Missing functionality: The code does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are not valid non-negative integers represented as strings or if they exceed the maximum number of digits. **
