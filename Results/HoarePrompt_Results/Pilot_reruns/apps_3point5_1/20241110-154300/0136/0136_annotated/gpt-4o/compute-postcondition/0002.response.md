Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `data` with leading zeros removed. As `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, removing leading zeros does not change its value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
