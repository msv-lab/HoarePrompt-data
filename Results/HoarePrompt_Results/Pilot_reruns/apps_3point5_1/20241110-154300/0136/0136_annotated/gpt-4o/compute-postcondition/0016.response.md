The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the sum of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, which are represented as strings and can contain up to 10^6 digits. The function should handle the addition of these large integers and return the result as a string.
Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the sum of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, represented as strings, while handling extremely large numbers.**
