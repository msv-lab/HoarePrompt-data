Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very long integers a and b from input as a whole line using `input().split()`.
2. Leading zeroes are removed from both a and b using `lstrip('0')`.
3. If after removing leading zeroes, a or b becomes an empty string, it is replaced with '0'.
4. The program then compares the lengths of a and b. If the length of a is less than b, it prints '<'. If the length of a is greater than b, it prints '>'. If the lengths are equal, it compares the values of a and b as strings. It prints '<' if a is less than b, '>' if a is greater than b, and '=' if they are equal.
5. The program covers all cases mentioned in the problem description and handles leading zeroes appropriately.
