The function `func` does not accept any parameters but prompts the user for an integer `s` within the range 0 to 99. It then prints out the corresponding word representation of `s` according to predefined arrays `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`. The function covers cases where `s` is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and greater than or equal to 20, providing the correct word representation for each scenario. No explicit return value is specified in the function.
