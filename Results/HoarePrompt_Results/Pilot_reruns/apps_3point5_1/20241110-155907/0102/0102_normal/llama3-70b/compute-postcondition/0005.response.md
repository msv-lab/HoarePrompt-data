Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is used to index the `teens` list after subtracting 10, so if `s` is in the range 10 to 19, the corresponding value from the `teens` list is printed. The value of `s` is between 0 and 99, so if it falls within the range 10 to 19, the corresponding value from the `teens` list is printed. The variable `ones` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged.
Output State: **s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged**
