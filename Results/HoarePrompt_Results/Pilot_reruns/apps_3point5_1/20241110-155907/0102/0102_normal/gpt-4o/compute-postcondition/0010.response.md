Postcondition: ***`ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of numbers from ten to ninety. If 0 <= n <= 9, the function returns the string representation of the number at index `n` in the `ones` list. If 11 <= n <= 19, the function returns the string representation of the number at index n - 10 in the `teens` list. If 10 <= n <= 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the string representation of the number at index n // 10 in the `tens` list. If 10 <= n <= 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the number at index n // 10 in the `tens` list, followed by a hyphen and the string representation of the number at index n % 10 in the `ones` list. This covers all possible scenarios when n is within the range of 0 to 99, ensuring the correct string representation is returned for each case.***
