The function func_1 accepts an integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and returns the appropriate string representation based on the value of n. If n is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If n is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string from the `teens` list by adjusting the index. For n between 10 and 99, if n is divisible by 10, the function returns the string from the `tens` list based on the division of n by 10. If n is not divisible by 10, the function returns a concatenated string representation of the tens and ones place separated by a hyphen. This functionality covers all possible scenarios when n is within the range of 0 to 99, ensuring the correct string representation is returned for each case.
