Postcondition: ***`ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of numbers from ten to ninety. If 10 <= n <= 99, the function returns the string representation of the number at index n // 10 in the `tens` list if n is divisible by 10. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the number at index n // 10 in the `tens` list, followed by a hyphen and the string representation of the number at index n % 10 in the `ones` list. This postcondition covers all scenarios when n is within the range 10 to 99, handling cases where n is a multiple of 10 or not, providing the correct string representation for each case.***
