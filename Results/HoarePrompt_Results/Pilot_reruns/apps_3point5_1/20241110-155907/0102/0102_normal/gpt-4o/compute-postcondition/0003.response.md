Example Answer: 
The function returns the element at index `n` from the `ones` list. No variables are changed other than the return value. Therefore, the output state is `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of numbers from ten to ninety, and the function returns the element at index `n` from the `ones` list.
Output State: **`ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of numbers from ten to ninety, and the function returns the element at index `n` from the `ones` list**
