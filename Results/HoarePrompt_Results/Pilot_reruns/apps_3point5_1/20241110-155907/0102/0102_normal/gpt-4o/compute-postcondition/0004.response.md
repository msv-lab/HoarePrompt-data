Example Answer: 
The function returns the value of `teens[n - 10]`. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value. Therefore, the output state is: `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of numbers from ten to ninety.
Output State: **`ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of numbers from ten to ninety**
