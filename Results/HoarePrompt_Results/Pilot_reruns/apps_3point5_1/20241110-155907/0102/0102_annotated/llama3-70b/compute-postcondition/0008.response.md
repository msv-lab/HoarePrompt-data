Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the corresponding value from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the function prints the corresponding value from the `teens` list based on `s - 10`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 20, the function prints the concatenation of the value from the `tens` list at index `s // 10` and the value from the `ones` list at index `s % 10`, separated by a hyphen if `s % 10` is not 0. This postcondition covers all scenarios and edge cases for the execution of the program fragment.***
