Functionality: ** The function receives an integer input 's' and prints out the corresponding value in words based on the input value. It categorizes 's' into three ranges: single-digit numbers, numbers between 10 and 19, and numbers between 20 and 99. For single-digit numbers, it prints the corresponding word from the 'ones' list. For numbers between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the 'teens' list. For numbers between 20 and 99, it constructs the word by combining the word from the 'tens' list at the tens place and the word from the 'ones' list at the units place, separated by a hyphen if needed. The function covers all possible scenarios within the ranges of 0 to 99.**
