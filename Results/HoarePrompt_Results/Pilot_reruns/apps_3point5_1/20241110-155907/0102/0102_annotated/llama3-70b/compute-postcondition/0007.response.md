Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 20, the function prints the corresponding value from the `teens` list based on `s - 10`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 20, the function prints the concatenation of the value from the `tens` list at index `s // 10` and the value from the `ones` list at index `s % 10`, separated by a hyphen if `s % 10` is not 0. The postcondition covers all edge cases for the program execution.***
