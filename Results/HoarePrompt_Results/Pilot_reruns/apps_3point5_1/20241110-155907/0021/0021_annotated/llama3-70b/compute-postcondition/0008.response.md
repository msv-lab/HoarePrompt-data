Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then reads a list of integers `a`. It finds the indices of the first occurrence of 1 and `n` in the list `a`, calculates the maximum and minimum distances between these indices and prints the maximum of either the maximum distance or `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not take any parameters and does not return any value. However, the code does not handle cases where the values 1 and `n` do not exist in the list `a`, potentially leading to a `ValueError` when trying to find their indices.**
