Example Answer:
`a` is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input values split by space. Since `n` is an input integer, the state after execution is `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**
