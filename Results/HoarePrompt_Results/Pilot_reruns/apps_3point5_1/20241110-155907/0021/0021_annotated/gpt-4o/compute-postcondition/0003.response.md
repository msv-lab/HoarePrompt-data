Example Answer: 
max_pos is assigned the index of n in list a. Since the integers in list a are distinct and each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), the index of n in list a would be n-1. Therefore, max_pos is n-1. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1**
