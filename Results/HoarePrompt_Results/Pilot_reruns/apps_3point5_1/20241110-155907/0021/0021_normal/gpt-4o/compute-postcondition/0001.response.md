Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values input from the user after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The list `a` now contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` provided as input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
