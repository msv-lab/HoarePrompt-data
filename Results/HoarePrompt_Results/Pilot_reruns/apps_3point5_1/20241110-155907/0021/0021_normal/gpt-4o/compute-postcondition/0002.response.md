Example Answer:
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the value 1 in the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the index of 1 in a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` will always be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0**
