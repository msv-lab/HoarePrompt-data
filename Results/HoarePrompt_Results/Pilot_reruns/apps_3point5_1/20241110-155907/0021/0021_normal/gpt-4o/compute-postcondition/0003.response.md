Example Answer: 
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the element `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is known as it is an input integer, and `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Since the list is 0-indexed, `max_pos` will be the index of the element `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, `max_pos` will be the position of `n` in list `a`. The value of `min_pos` is not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`**
