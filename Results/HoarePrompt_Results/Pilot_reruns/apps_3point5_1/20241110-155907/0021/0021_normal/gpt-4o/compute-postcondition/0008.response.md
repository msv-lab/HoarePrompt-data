Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, `dist4`**
