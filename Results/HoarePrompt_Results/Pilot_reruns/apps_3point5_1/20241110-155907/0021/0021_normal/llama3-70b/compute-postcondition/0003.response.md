Example Answer:
The variable `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, and the list `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive. Since `a` contains distinct integers, the index of `n` in list `a` is unique. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`**
