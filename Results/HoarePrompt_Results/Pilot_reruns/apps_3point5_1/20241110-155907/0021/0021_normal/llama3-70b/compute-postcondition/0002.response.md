Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the number 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to `pos1`. Since each integer in list `a` is distinct and between 1 and n, and 1 is guaranteed to be in the list, the index of 1 will always exist. Therefore, `pos1` will be the index of 1 in list `a`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`**
