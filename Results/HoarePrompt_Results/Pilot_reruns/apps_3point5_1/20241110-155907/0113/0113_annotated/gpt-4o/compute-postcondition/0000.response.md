Example Answer: 
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` can take values between 0 and 8 inclusive, the possible values of `multiplier` range from 1 to 100,000,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `multiplier` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100,000,000.
Output State: **`multiplier` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100,000,000**
