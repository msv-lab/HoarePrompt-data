Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers within the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
