Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated by multiplying `n` by `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. Since `n` and `multiplier` are positive integers, and `k` is a non-negative integer, `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` will return a positive integer. Therefore, `x` will be a multiple of `n` that is divisible by `multiplier`. The output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, and x is the result of the calculation.
