Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input and calculates the `k`-rounding of `n` correctly.
- The function `func_1` calculates a multiplier based on the value of `k` and then multiplies `n` by this multiplier to get the `k`-rounding of `n`.
- The output hints agree with the code and also confirm that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
- All the provided examples in the problem description are covered by the code and give the correct output.
