Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer. Since `k` can be between 0 and 8 inclusive, the value of `multiplier` will be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 depending on the value of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
