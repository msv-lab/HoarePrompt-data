According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is updated, chosen_route is set to i + 1, i is incremented by 1, s_i is the source of the next tuple in bus_routes, and d_i is the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Increment `i` by 1
- Update `s_i` to the source of the next tuple in bus_routes
- Update `d_i` to the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is updated, chosen_route is set to i + 2, i is incremented by 1, s_i is the source of the next tuple in bus_routes, and d_i is the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes**
