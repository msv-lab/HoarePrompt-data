According to the postcondition, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. `s_i` needs to be assigned the source of the next tuple in bus_routes.
3. `d_i` needs to be assigned the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes.
4. `s_i` and `d_i` need to be assigned the values of the next tuple in bus_routes.
5. If `s_i >= t`, wait_time is calculated as `s_i - t`.
6. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then wait_time is initialized to 0.
7. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

State: **Postcondition holds true after adjusting the necessary states for the next iteration.**
