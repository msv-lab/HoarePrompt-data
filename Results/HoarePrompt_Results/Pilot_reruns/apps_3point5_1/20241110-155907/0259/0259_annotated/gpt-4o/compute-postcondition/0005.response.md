Example Answer: 
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the first tuple, d_i is the destination of the first tuple, and wait_time is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the first tuple, d_i is the destination of the first tuple, and wait_time is 0**
