Example Answer:
`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity. This variable will be used to keep track of the minimum waiting time for Serval at the bus station. Since no calculations have been performed yet, the output state is: Precondition: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station. bus_routes is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. min_wait_time is positive infinity.
