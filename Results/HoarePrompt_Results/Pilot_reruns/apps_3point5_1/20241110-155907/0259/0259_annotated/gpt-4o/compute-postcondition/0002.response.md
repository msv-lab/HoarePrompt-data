According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than 0. However, the initial state does not ensure the loop will execute, so adjustments need to be made. For the loop to execute, the variables need to be modified as follows:
State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0**
