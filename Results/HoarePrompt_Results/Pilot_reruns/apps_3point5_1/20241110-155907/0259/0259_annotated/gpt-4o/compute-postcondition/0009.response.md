Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is wait_time, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the first tuple, d_i is the destination of the first tuple. If s_i is greater than or equal to t, wait_time is calculated as s_i minus t. If (t - s_i) divided by d_i equals 0, then wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i.**
