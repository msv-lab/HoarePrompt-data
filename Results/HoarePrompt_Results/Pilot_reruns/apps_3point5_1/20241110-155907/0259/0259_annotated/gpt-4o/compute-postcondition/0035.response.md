The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes.
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station.
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively.

After the loop executes, the function returns `chosen_route`, which is set to the index of the chosen route plus 1. Additionally, `min_wait_time` contains the minimum wait time, `i` equals n - 1, `s_i` is the source of the last tuple in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the destination of the last tuple in `bus_routes`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`, calculate the minimum wait time and choose the best bus route based on the input parameters, and then return the index of the chosen route.
