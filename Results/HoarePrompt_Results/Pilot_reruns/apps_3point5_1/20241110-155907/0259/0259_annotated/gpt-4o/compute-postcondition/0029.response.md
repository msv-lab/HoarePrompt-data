Output State: **min_wait_time is updated, chosen_route is set to i + 2, i is incremented by 1, s_i is the source of the next tuple in bus_routes, d_i is the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes, and s_i, d_i are assigned the values of the next tuple in bus_routes. If s_i >= t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, then wait_time is initialized to 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.**
