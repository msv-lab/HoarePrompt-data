Example Answer:
The list `buses` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is an empty list**
