According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop will definitely execute. At the start of the loop, `buses` is an empty list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the adjusted state should be `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, and `buses` is still an empty list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is an empty list**
