Postcondition: ***`min_time` is the minimum value of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is the index of the minimum time value plus 1, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values extracted from the first element of the buses list, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. This condition is updated only if the calculated time is less than the previous minimum time value.***
