Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are not given in the initial state, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`**
