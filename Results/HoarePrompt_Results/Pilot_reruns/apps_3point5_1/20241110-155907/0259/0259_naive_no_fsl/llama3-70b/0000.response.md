Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes input for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. It then iterates through each bus route, calculates the time difference between the arrival time of the first bus on that route and Serval's arrival time, and keeps track of the minimum time difference. Finally, it prints the bus route with the minimum time difference, which is the correct bus route for Serval to take according to the problem description. The logic implemented in the program correctly handles the scenario where Serval will choose the bus with the least waiting time.
