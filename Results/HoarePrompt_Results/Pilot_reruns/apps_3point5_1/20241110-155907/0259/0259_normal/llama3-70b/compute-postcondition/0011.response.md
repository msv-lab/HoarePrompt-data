According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer + 2, `t` is a positive integer, and buses contains a new tuple (s, d). For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer + 2, t is a positive integer, buses contains a new tuple (s, d), _ is less than n + 1**
