Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated to 2, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `s` and `d` are the values of the third tuple in the `buses` list, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, if the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. All variables maintain their initial values and relationships after the execution of the if statement, ensuring proper handling of edge cases where `time` is not less than `min_time`.***
