Example Answer:
The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values by splitting the input into integers using `map` and `int`. The values of `s` and `d` are updated accordingly. The initial state of `n` and `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer + 1, t is a positive integer, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d).
Output State: **n is a positive integer + 1, t is a positive integer, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d)**
