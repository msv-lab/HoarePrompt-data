According to the code, the loop will execute n times. The loop will execute even if n is 0. So, for the loop to execute, t being a positive integer is enough. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer.
State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer**
