Example Answer:
The values of s and d are assigned by mapping the input to integers. The values of s and d are determined by the input provided. Since the initial state of variables n and t are not specified, the output state will be: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, s is determined by input, d is determined by input.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, s is determined by input, d is determined by input**
