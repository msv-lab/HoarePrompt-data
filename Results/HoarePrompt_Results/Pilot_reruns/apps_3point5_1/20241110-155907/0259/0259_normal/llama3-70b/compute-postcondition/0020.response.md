According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `buses`. If `buses` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is an integer, `min_time`, `i`, `s`, `d` are as described. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `buses` must have at least 2 elements. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`ans` is 1, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the second tuple in the `buses` list, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`**
