According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer + 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, it needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer + 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer + 2, t is a positive integer, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d)**
