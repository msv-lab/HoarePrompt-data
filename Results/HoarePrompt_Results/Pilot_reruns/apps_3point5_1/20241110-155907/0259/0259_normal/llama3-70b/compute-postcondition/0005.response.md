According to the code, the loop will execute 'n' times based on the range(n). At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer and t is a positive integer. Additionally, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d). For the loop to execute one more time, n should be incremented by 1 to account for the next iteration.
State: **n is a positive integer + 1, t is a positive integer, the list buses contains a new tuple (s, d)**
