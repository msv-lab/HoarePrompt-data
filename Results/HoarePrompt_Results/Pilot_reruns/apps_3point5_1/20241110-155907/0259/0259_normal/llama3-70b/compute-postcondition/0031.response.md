Output State: **`ans` is an integer. If the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`. In all cases, `ans` is the index of the tuple in `buses` with the smallest `time` value, starting from 1. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains -1.**
