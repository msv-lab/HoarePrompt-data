Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program fragment execution, ensuring the initial state of the variables is maintained while updating `wait_time` based on the conditions.***
