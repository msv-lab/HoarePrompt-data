Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This ensures that the program variables are in the correct state after the if else block executes, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
