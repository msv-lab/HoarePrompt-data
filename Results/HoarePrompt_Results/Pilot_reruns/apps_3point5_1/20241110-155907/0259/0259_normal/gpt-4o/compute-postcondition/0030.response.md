Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`, but the initial state of `i` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is calculated as `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is calculated as `i + 1`**
