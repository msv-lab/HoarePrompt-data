The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes.
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station.
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers: `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route respectively.

The function calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route based on the conditions provided. It updates `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` during the loop execution. After the loop, it returns the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time. 
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function sets `min_wait_time` to positive infinity and `chosen_route` to -1.
