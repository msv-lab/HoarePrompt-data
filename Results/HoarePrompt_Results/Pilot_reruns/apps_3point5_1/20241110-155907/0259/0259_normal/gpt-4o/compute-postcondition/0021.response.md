Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is the minimum of all `wait_time` values encountered, `chosen_route` is updated to the index of the minimum `wait_time` route. `n` remains greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration. The updated `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions specified in the precondition, ensuring the integrity of the initial state of the variables. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program fragment execution, handling cases where `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time` and updating `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` accordingly.***
