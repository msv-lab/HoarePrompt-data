Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If s_i >= t, `wait_time` is set to s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i, ensuring that all possible scenarios and edge cases are covered for the program variables after the if-else block executes.***
