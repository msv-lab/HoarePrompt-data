Example Answer:
`wait_time` is assigned the value 0. Since `wait_time` is now 0, the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration, `wait_time` is 0**
