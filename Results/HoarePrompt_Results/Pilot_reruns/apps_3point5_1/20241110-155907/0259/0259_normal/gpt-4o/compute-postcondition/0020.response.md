Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the chosen route. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the updated value based on the index `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the updated value based on the index `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration**
