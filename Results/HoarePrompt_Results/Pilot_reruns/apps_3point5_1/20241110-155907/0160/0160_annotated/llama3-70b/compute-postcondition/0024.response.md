Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`. The value of `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`, so the new value of `max_divisor` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison with `i`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, i is less than the square root of gcd**
