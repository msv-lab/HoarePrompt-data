Postcondition: ***N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison with `i`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the integer division of `gcd` by `i`.***
