According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is 2 or greater, `K` is any integer, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `i`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1. If gcd % i == 0, then `max_divisor` is updated accordingly. If i * i is not equal to gcd, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and gcd // i. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `i + 1`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1**
