Postcondition: ***N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers. If gcd % i == 0, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is further updated to be the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and gcd divided by `i`. The postcondition also ensures that `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1 and that i is less than the square root of gcd.***
