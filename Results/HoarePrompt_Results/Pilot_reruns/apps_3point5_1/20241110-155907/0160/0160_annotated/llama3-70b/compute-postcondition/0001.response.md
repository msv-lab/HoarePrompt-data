Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values obtained by mapping each input integer after splitting the input string. The values of `N` and `K` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a list containing integers obtained from input.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a list containing integers obtained from input**
