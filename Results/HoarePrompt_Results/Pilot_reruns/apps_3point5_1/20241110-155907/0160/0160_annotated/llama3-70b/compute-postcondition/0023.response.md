Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. The previous values of `max_divisor` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison with `i`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, i is less than the square root of gcd.
Output State: **N is 2 or greater, K is any integer, A is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison with `i`, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, i is less than the square root of gcd**
