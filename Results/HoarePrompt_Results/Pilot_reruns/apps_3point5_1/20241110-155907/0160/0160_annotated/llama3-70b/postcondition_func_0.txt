The function `func` reads input values for N and K, followed by a list of integers A. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A and determines the maximum divisor of this gcd. The function prints the maximum divisor as the output. If the gcd is 1, the loop executes once to find the maximum divisor. If the gcd is 0, the loop does not execute. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.
