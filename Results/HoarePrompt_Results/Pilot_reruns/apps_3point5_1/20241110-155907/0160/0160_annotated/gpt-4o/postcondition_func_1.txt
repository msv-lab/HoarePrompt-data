The function func_2 accepts a positive integer x, finds all the divisors of x, sorts them in reverse order, and returns the sorted divisors set. The function correctly generates all divisors of x using a set, but the reverse sorting returned by the function may not be accurate as the code does not explicitly reverse the divisors set. This missing functionality should be noted in the summary. Additionally, the code does not handle edge cases where x is not a positive integer, which could be considered a missing logic in the function.
