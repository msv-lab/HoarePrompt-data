Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` already contains at least one divisor of `x`, after adding `i`, `divisors` will have another divisor of `x`. The range of `i` is from 1 to the square root of `x`, so the new `divisors` set will contain more divisors of `x`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing more divisors of `x`, `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`**
