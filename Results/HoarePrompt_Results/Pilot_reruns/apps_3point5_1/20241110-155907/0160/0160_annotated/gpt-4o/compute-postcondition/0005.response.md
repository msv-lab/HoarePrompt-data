According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing at least one and potentially more divisors of `x`, and `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`divisors` is a set containing at least one and potentially more divisors of `x`, `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x` incremented by 1**
