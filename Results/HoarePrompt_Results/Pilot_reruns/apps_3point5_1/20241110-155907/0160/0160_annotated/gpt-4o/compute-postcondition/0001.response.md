According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` falls within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be within that range. Additionally, since `divisors` is an empty set before the loop starts, it indicates that no divisors have been found yet. For the loop to execute, `divisors` should be adjusted to indicate that it is not empty, so it should contain at least one element, which is a divisor of `x`.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing at least one divisor of `x`, `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`**
