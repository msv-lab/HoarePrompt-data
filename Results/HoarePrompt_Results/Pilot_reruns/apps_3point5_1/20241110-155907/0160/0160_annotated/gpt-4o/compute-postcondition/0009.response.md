According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x` incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing at least one and potentially more divisors of `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next `i` value should be considered. The next `i` value should be the next integer after the current square root of `x`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from the current square root of `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing at least one and potentially more divisors of `x`, `i` is the next integer after the square root of `x`**
