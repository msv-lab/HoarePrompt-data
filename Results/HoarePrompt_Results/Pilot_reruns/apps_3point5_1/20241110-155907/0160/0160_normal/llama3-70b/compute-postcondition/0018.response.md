Output State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the greatest common divisor of all integers in list `A` and 1 if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `gcd` is greater than 1, and `math` is defined, `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` value and 2**
