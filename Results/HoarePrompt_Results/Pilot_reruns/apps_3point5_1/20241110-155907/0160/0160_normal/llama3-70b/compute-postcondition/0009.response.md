According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the previous iteration, `N` is greater than 2 and `i` is 5. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 6.
State: **List A contains N integers ranging from 1 to 10^6, gcd is updated based on calculations, N is greater than 2, i is 6**
