According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 2, and `i` is incremented by 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be 3 more than the previous value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **List A contains N integers ranging from 1 to 10^6, gcd is updated based on calculations, N is greater than 2, i is 5**
