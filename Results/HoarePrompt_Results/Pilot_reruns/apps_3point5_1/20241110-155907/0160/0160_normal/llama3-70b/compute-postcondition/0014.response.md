Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is reassigned to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `gcd` is greater than 1, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is updated to a new value based on the calculation result.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated to a new value based on the calculation result**
