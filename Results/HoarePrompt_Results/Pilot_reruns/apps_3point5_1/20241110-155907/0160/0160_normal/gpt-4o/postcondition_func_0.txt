The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst`. It calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `lst` using the math.gcd function. If the list `lst` has only one element, the function returns that element as the greatest common divisor. The function then returns the calculated greatest common divisor along with the last element in the list `lst`.
