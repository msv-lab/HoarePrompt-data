According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by i, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. `i` ranges from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the next value of `i` becomes `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` and the loop will exit. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by `int(math.sqrt(x))`. `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**.
