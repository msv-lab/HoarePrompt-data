Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, the value of `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, the new divisor set `divisors` now includes this new value.
Output State: **`divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by `int(math.sqrt(x))` and `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
