Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts a positive integer x, calculates all the divisors of x up to its square root (inclusive), including the result of x divided by the square root of x if applicable. The function then returns a sorted list of these divisors in reverse order. If x is not a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the function returns an empty list.**
