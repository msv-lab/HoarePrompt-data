Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, which is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The result is added to the set of `divisors`. The previous values of `divisors` contain all divisors of `x` up to its square root. After this operation, the set `divisors` will now include the result of `x` divided by `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.
Output State: **`divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
