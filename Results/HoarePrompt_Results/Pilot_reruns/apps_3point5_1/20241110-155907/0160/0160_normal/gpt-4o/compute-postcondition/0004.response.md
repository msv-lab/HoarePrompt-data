Postcondition: ***`divisors` is an empty set initially. `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` starts at 1 and ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, both `i` and `x // i` are added to the `divisors` set. The `divisors` set would contain 1 and `x` after the if-else block executes, covering all possible cases of factors of `x`.***
