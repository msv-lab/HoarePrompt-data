Postcondition: ***`divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Additionally, if `x` is divisible by `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, then `divisors` will also contain this divisor. `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`***
