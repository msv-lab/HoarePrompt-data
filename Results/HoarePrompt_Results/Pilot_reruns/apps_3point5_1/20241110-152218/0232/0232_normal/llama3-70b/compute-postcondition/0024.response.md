Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 and greater than `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` key and value 0 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
