The function does not accept any parameters. It reads input values, processes them to determine if the counts of lightsabers of each color match the desired counts, and prints 'YES' if the counts match, and 'NO' if they do not. The function iterates through the colors and their counts to check if the total count matches the sum of all counts. If the colors list is empty, it will print 'NO'.
