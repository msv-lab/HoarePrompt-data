According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than `i`. Additionally, the loop will iterate from `i` to `n-1` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 and also greater than `i`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is equal to `i`**
