Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean that is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is mapped to 1 (if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, its count is set to 1), `j` is equal to `i+1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its count is increased by 1. After the execution of the if statement, the state of the program variables will remain the same as the precondition, with the addition that if the condition in the if statement is met, `found` will be True and the loop will break. No changes occur to the other variables specified in the precondition.***
