Postcondition: ***If the loop executes, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. `i` remains 1. `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1 and greater than `i`. `window_counts` is updated with the count of the new `color`. `j` is equal to the last value of `j` in the loop. `color` is assigned the value of the last `colors` element. If `color` was not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to the count of `color`. If the loop does not execute, the initial state remains the same as before the loop started.***
