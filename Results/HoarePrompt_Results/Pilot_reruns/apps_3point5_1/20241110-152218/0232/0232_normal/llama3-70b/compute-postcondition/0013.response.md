Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`, where `color` is a color from the `colors` list. The `color_counts` dictionary is updated with the count of `color` being set to `0`. The previous values of `colors` and `counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 more color left to process, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the updated counts of colors.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 more color left to process, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the updated counts of colors**
