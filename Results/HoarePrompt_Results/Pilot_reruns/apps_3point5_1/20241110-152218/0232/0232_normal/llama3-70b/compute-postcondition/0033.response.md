Output State: **`found` is a boolean variable that remains True if all counts in the dictionary `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in the `counts` list. `i` is an integer that remains 0. `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`. `window_counts` is a dictionary where each color key has a corresponding value of 0 if the color was not previously in `window_counts`. `j` is incremented by 1. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. Regardless of the color being in `window_counts` or not, the program ensures that the dictionary `window_counts` has the color key with a corresponding value of 0 if it was not previously present.**
