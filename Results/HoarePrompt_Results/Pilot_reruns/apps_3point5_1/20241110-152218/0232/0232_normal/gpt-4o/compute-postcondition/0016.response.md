Example Answer:
The value of current_counts at the index corresponding to the color at position `right` is incremented by 1. The previous values of current_counts and right are not provided, so the output state is: current_counts and desired_counts have been adjusted to satisfy the condition, and `right` is increased by 1.
Output State: **current_counts and desired_counts have been adjusted to satisfy the condition, and `right` is increased by 1**
