Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checks if the counts of lightsabers in that interval match the desired counts. If a matching interval is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loops. The program then prints "YES" if a matching interval was found, and "NO" otherwise. The logic of the program seems sound and covers all possible cases, so the correctness of the program is true.
