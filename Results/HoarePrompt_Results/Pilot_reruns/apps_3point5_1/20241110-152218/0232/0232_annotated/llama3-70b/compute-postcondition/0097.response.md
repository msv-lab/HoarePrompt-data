According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key with an incremented value of 1. `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, and `color` is the color at index 2 in the `colors` list**
