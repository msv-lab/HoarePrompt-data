Postcondition: ***`window_counts` dictionary contains the key `color` with an incremented value of 1. `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to `i`, `j` remains 0, and `found` is True if all values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If the color was not previously present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0.***
