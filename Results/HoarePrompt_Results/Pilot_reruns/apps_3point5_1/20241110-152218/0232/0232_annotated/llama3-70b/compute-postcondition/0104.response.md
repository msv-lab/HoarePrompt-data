Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key with a value of 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, and `color` is the color at index 2 in the `colors` list. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added as a key with a value of 0. If all values in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken.***
