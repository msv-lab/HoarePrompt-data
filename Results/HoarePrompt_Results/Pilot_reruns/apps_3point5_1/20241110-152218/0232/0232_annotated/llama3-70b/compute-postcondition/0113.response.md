Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values n, m, colors, and counts. It then constructs a dictionary `color_counts` to store the count of each color in the `colors` list. Next, it iterates through a range of indices to create a `window_counts` dictionary to track color counts within a window. If the counts in the `window_counts` match the target counts in the `counts` list, the function sets `found` to True. Finally, it prints 'YES' if a solution is found, indicating that the desired counts of lightsabers for each color can be achieved; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters.**
