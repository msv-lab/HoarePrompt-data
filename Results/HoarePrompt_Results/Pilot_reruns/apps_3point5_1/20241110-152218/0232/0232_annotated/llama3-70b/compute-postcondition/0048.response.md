Postcondition: ***If `colors` is an empty list or `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop will not execute. In this case, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, and `i` is equal to its initial value. If the loop does execute, `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the non-empty `colors` list, `colors` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `window_counts` will have keys for each color in the window with their counts updated, `i` is less than `n`, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts, and `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. The loop will break when the condition for `found` is met.***
