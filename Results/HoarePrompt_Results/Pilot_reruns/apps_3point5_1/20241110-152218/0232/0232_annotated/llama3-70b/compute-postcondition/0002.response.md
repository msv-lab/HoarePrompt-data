Example Answer:
The list `counts` is assigned the result of converting the input values to integers. Since `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with the total count being at least 1 and at most n.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with the total count being at least 1 and at most n**
