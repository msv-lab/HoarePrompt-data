Postcondition: ***`window_counts` dictionary contains the key `color` with a value that is either incremented by 1 if `color` was previously present or set to 1 if `color` was not present. `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 1, and `found` is True if all values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If all values in `window_counts` match with `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
