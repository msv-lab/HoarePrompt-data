Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. Since the input is not specified, the values of `n` and `m` can be any positive integers within the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with the total count being at least 1 and at most n.**
