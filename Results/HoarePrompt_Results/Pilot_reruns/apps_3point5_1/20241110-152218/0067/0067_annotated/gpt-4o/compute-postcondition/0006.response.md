Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('+')` does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer within the same range as `x`; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`**
