The function reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the input. It then prints different symbols based on the values of x, y, and z. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x equals y and z is 0, it prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, it prints '?'. If x does not equal y, it always prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
