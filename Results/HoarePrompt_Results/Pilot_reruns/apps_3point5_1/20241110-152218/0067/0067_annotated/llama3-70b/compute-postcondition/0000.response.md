Example Answer:
The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x,y,z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x,y,z <= 100**
