Example Answer:
`max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`, where `y` is the value of the variable `min_downvotes` and `z` is the value of the variable `z`. The values of `x, y, z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, so `max_downvotes` will be between `0 + 0` and `100 + 100`, i.e., `0` and `200`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200.
Output State: **`x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200**
