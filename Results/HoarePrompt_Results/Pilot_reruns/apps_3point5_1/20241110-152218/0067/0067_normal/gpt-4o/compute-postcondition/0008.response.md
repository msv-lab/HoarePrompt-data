Postcondition: ***`x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'.***
