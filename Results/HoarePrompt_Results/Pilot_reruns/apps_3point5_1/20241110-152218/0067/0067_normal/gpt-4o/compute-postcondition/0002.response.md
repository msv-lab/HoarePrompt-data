Example Answer:
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, where `x` and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Since `x` and `z` are non-negative integers, the sum of `x + z` will also be a non-negative integer between 0 and 200. Therefore, the Output State is: `x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200.
Output State: **`x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 200**
