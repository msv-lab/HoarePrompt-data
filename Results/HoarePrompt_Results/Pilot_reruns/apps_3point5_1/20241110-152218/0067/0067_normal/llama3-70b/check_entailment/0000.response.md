Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the code correctly prints '+'
- If `x` is less than `y`, the code correctly prints '-'
- If `x` is equal to `y`, the code further checks if `z` is 0 and prints '0' or prints '?' if `z` is not 0
- If `x` is not equal to `y`, the code correctly prints '?'.

The code seems to cover all the possible cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints also agree with the functionality of the code. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
