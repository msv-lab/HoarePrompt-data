Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If `x` is greater than `y + z`, then the result is definitely "+", which is handled correctly.
- If `x` is less than `y`, then the result is definitely "-", which is handled correctly.
- If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, the result is "0" and if `z` is not 0, the result is uncertain, which is handled correctly.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the result is uncertain, which is also handled correctly.
