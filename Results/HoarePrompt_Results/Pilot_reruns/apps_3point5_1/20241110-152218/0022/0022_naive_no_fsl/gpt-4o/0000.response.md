Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the given string is symmetric around the middle. It iterates over the first half of the string and compares the characters with their corresponding characters from the second half. If all characters match, it returns `True`, indicating that the string is an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns `False`. The main program then reads the input string, calls `func_1`, and prints "TAK" if the function returns `True` and "NIE" if it returns `False`. This logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
