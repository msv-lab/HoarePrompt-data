Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True initially, and `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop breaks. This condition covers cases where the input string `s` is not a palindrome, and the program flags it as such.***
