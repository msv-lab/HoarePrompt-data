Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `i` is 2 initially. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. This condition covers the scenario where the string `s` is not a palindrome at index `i`.***
