Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, then the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables `s`, `n`, and `i`.***
