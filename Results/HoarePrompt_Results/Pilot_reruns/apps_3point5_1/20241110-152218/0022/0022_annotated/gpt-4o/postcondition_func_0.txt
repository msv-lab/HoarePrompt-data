The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length between 1 and 1000. It then checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string match. If the characters do not match at any symmetric positions, the function returns False. The function returns True if all symmetric positions have matching characters. If the length of the string `s` is less than 2, the function does not execute the loop.
