The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). It initializes an integer `n` to the length of `s`. Then, it iterates through the first half of the string comparing characters at symmetric positions. If any pair of characters is not equal, the function returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If all character pairs are equal, the function returns True.
