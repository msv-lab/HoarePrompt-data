The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). It also accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 1000, and an integer `i` initialized to 0. 

In Case 1, the function compares the character at index `i` in `s` with the character at index `n - 1 - i`. If they are not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.

In Case 2, there is no specific operation defined and no return value specified.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s`, an integer `n`, and an integer `i`, and in Case 1, it compares characters at specific indices in the string `s` and returns False if they are not equal. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.
