Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`. As the length of the string `s` can vary between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), the value of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000 (inclusive); `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **s is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000 (inclusive); `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
