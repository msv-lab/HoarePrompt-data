Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This accounts for all cases where the palindrome condition is checked for the given string `s` up to the specified index `n`.***
