Functionality: The function `func` reads a string input from the user, calculates its length, and then determines if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string towards the center. If the characters do not match at any point, the variable `is_spalindrome` is set to False. Finally, the function prints 'TAK' if the input string is a palindrome and 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not explicitly return a value, and the output is based on the print statement. The function does not handle cases where the input string contains special characters, numbers, or spaces, and its behavior for such cases is not specified.
