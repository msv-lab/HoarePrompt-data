Example Answer:
The value of `result` is calculated by subtracting `remainder` from `n`. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer, and `remainder` is a single digit between 0 and 9. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a single digit between 0 and 9, and `result` is the result of subtracting `remainder` from `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a single digit between 0 and 9, `result` is the result of subtracting `remainder` from `n`**
