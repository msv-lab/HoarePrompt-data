The function `func` takes user input as a non-negative integer `n` within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It then checks if `n` is divisible by 10. If it is, it prints `n`. If not, it further checks if the remainder when dividing `n` by 10 is less than or equal to 5. If true, it prints a multiple of 10 obtained by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If false, it prints a value obtained by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`. The function does not have any specific return value.
