Correctness: True

Explanation: The program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly rounds the input number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The logic in the code is sound, and it covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The program considers both cases where the remainder is less than or equal to 5 and greater than 5, leading to the correct rounding behavior. Additionally, the code handles the edge case where the input number itself ends with 0 and does not perform any unnecessary rounding in that case. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
