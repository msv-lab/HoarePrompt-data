Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the value of n rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the function prints the value of n rounded up to the next multiple of 10 greater than n.***
