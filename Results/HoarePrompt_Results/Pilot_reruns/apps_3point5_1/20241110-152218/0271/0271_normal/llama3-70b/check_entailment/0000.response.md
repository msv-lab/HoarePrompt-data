Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer n from the user and prints the nearest multiple of 10 based on the value of n as described in the problem. If n is a multiple of 10, it prints n. If n is less than or equal to 5 modulo 10, it prints the rounded down value to the nearest multiple of 10. If n is greater than 5 modulo 10, it prints the rounded up value to the next multiple of 10 greater than n. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
