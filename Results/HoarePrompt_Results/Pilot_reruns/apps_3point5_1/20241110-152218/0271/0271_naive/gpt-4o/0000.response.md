Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer input and rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It calculates the remainder when dividing the input by 10 and then rounds it accordingly. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from the input, otherwise, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to the input. This logic covers all possible cases and correctly rounds the input to the nearest integer ending with 0 as required by the problem description. All the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the given program.
