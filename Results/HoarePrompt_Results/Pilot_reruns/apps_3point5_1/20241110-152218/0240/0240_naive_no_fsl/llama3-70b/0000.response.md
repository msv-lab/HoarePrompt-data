Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to build a new string `n` by only including the characters that are present in `t`. Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. This logic correctly follows the problem description and for all potential cases, it will output the smallest integer `n` that Vasya could pass to Kate.
