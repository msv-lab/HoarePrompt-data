The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, where `s` and `t` are strings. The function checks for characters in `s` that are also present in `t`. If any such characters are found, they are concatenated with string `t` to form a new string `n`. If no matching characters are found, `n` remains empty. Finally, the function returns the integer value of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, extract characters from `s` that are in `t`, concatenate them with `t`, and return the integer value of the resulting string `n`.
