Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`. If the function `is_valid_number` returns true for the `candidate` and `sub`, then the function yields the `candidate`.***
