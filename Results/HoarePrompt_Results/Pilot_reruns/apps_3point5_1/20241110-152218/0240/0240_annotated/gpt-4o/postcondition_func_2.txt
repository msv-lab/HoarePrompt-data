Functionality: The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. If `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, the function generates permutations of the characters in `chars`. For each permutation, it creates a candidate string and checks its validity using the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If the candidate passes the validation, it yields the candidate. If `chars` is an empty string, the function does not execute the loop.
