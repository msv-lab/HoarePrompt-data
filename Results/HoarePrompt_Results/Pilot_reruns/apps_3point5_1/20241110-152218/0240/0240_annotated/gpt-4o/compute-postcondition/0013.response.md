Output State: 
- If `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, the loop will execute to generate permutations of the characters in `chars`. 
- For each permutation, `perm` will be assigned the current permutation, and `candidate` will be the string formed by joining the characters in the permutation. 
- If `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub` in the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the loop yields `candidate`. 
- If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and no action is taken.

**If chars is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, the loop generates permutations, checks their validity, and yields valid candidates. If chars is an empty string, the loop does not execute.**
