According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of the characters in `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `chars`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. This means adjusting the state of `perm` to be the next permutation after the current `perm`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `chars`**
