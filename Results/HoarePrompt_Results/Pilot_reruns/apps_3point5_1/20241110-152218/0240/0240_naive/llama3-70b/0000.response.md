Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` and only keeps the characters that are present in `t`. It then appends the substring `t` to the end of the filtered string `n`. Finally, it converts the resulting string back to an integer and prints it out. 

The program follows the problem description correctly and is able to reconstruct the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the given input. The logic is sound and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
