Functionality: **The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string representing a sequence of digits, and `sub`, a string representing a substring. It generates permutations of the characters in `chars`, concatenates them to form `candidate`, and yields `candidate` only if it satisfies the condition specified by `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If there are no valid candidates or if `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not found in `candidate`, no values are yielded. The function does not have a specific return value provided in the given information.**
