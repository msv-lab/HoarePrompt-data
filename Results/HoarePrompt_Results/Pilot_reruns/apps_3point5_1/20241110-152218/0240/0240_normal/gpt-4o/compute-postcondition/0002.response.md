Example Answer:
The `yield` statement returns `candidate`, which is a string formed by joining the elements of `perm`. The state of other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `candidate` is a string formed by joining the elements of `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining the elements of `perm`**
