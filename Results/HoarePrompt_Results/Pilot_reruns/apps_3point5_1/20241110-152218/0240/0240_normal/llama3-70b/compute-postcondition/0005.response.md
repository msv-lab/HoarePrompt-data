According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If there are more characters left in the string `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the value of `c` added to the end if `c` is in `t_set`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged. 

To execute the loop one more time, the string `s` should still have characters remaining. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to `s`. The other states that need to be adjusted are related to the loop variables `c` and `n`. Since the loop will move to the next character in the string `s`, `n` should be updated based on the next character `c` in `s`. If the next character `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` should have `c` added to the end. If `c` is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the value of the next character in `s` added to the end if the next character is in `t_set`. If the next character is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged.**
