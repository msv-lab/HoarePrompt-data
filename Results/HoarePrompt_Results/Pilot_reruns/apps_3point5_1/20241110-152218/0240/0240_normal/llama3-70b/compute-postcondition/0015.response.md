The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, both of which are strings. After executing the function body, if string `s` is empty or none of the characters in `s` are in `t`, the function returns an empty string `n`. If at least one character in `s` is in `t`, the function will create a new string `n` containing only those characters from `s` that are in `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and return a new string `n` containing only the characters from `s` that are also present in `t`. If `s` is empty or none of its characters are in `t`, then `n` remains an empty string.
