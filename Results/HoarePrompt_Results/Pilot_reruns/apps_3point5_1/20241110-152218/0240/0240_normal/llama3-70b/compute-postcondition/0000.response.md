Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is assigned the set of characters present in string `t`. The values of `t` and `s` are not affected, so the output state is: `s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`.
Output State: **`s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`**
