Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]` or remains 0. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before `j` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is either incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]` or remains 0.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is either incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]` or remains 0**
