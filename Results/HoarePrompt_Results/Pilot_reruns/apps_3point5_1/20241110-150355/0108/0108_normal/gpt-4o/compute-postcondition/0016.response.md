Output State: **If the string `s` contains all the letters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to `target_len` which is 26. If `s` does not contain all the letters in order, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be less than 26. If `s` is shorter than the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` will be less than the length of `s`, `j` will be 0.**
