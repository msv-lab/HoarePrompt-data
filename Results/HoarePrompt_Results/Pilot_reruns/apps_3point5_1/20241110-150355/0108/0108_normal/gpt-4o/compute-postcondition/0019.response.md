Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all the letters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order, `i` is equal to the length of `s` and `j` is equal to `target_len` which is 26, then the program prints `target`. If `s` does not contain all the letters in order, `i` is equal to the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26, then the program prints -1. If `s` is shorter than the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is 0, then the program prints -1.***
