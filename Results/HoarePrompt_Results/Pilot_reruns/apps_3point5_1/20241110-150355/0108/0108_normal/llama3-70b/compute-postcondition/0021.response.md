Example Answer:
The value of 'char' is concatenated to the end of 'res'. 'char' is the last replaced letter, so it gets added to 'res'. 's' contains the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char', 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' contains the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char', 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 'char' is the last replaced letter and 'char' is in the updated 's'.
Output State: **'s' contains the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char', 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 'char' is the last replaced letter and 'char' is in the updated 's'**
