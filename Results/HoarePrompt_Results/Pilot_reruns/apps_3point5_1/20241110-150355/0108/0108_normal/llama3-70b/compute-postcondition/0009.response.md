According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `char` is 'a' and `s` is 'bbr'. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `char` needs to be in `s`. Therefore, the value of `char` needs to change to 'b' for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`s` is 'bbr', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'b'**
