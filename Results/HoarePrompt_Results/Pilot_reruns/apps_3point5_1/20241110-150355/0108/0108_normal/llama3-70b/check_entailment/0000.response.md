Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. When the input string `s` does not contain all 26 letters of the English alphabet, the code will never reach a point where `len(res)` equals 26. This means that the code will always print -1 in such cases, even if it is possible to obtain a string containing the English alphabet as a subsequence. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem.
