Example Answer: 
The character 'char' in string 's' is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. Since 'char' is 'a', it is replaced with 'b'. The replace function only replaces the first occurrence, so the output state is: `s` is a string with 'char' replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'char' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
