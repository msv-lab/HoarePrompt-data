Example Answer:
The character 'b' is added to the string stored in the variable 'res', which results in 'aab'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 'bbr', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aab', `char` is 'b'.
Output State: **`s` is 'bbr', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aab', `char` is 'b'**
