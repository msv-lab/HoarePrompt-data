Example Answer:
'res' is appended with the value of 'char', so 'res' now contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order. 'char' itself is the last replaced letter and is also updated in 's'. Therefore, the Output State is: If 'char' is present in 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'.
Output State: **If 'char' is present in 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'**
