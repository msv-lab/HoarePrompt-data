Example Answer: 
The value of `char` is added to `res`. Since `char` is the next character in `alphabet` and `char` is in `s`, the value of `char` is valid and can be added to `res`. Therefore, after execution, `res` will have the next two characters in the alphabet added to it. The value of `alphabet` has the first two characters removed, but it does not impact the addition of `char` to `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` has the next four characters in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first two characters removed, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` and `char` is in `s`.
Output State: **`res` has the next four characters in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first two characters removed, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` and `char` is in `s`**
