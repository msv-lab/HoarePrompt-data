Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, it can be seen that the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The code takes a string `s` as input and iterates through the alphabet, replacing each character with the next character in the alphabet until all 26 characters are included in the resulting string `res`. If `res` contains all 26 English lowercase letters, it is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. The code handles the scenario where it's impossible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence by returning -1, as specified in the problem description. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the code logic, and upon matching them with the code and problem description, it is evident that the code functions as intended.
