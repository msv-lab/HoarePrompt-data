Example Answer:
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. Since `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, the character following `char` is `d`. Therefore, the first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `d`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `res` has the next two characters in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first two characters removed, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` and `char` is in `s`.
Output State: **`res` has the next two characters in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first two characters removed, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` and `char` is in `s`**
