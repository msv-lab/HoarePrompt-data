Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet after it. The `char` is processed, so the next character in the alphabet is assigned to `char`. Therefore, after execution, the `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet, and the `s` string is modified accordingly.
Output State: **`res` contains at least one character from 'alphabet', 'alphabet' has at least one unprocessed lowercase English letter, `char` is the next character in 'alphabet' after the last processed one**
