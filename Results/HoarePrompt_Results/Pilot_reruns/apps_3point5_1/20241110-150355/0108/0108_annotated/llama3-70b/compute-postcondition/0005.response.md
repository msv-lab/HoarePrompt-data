Example Answer:
The `replace()` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. Since `char` is the first character in the `alphabet`, it will be replaced by the character that comes after it, which is 'b'. Therefore, the new value of `s` will have the first occurrence of the first character in `alphabet` replaced by 'b'.
Output State: **`s` is the original string with the first occurrence of the first character in `alphabet` replaced by 'b', `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` is 'a', `char` is the first character in `alphabet'**
