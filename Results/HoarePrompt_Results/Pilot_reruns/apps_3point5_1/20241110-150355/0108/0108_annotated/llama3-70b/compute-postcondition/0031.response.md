According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the added character `char`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`res` contains the added character `char`**
