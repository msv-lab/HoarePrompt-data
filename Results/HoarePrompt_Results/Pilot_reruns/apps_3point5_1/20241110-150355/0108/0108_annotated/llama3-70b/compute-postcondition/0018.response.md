Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to `res`, where `res` already has the next character in the alphabet added to it. The first character is removed from `alphabet`, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, which is also present in `s`. Therefore, after execution, `res` will have the next two characters in the alphabet added to it. The state of `alphabet` and `char` will change accordingly.
Output State: **`res` has the next two characters in the alphabet added to it, `alphabet` has the first two characters removed, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` and `char` is in `s`**
