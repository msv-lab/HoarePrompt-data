Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user and processes it to create a new string `res` by replacing the characters in `s` with the next character in the alphabet based on the order of appearance. If the resulting string `res` contains all 26 English lowercase letters, it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and it is expected to return nothing.**
