Example Answer: 
The code appends the first character of the alphabet string to the empty string res. The alphabet contains all lowercase English letters, and char is assigned the first character of the alphabet, which is 'a'. Therefore, after execution, res will be 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.  
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` is 'a', `char` is the first character in `alphabet'**
