According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has the original string with the first occurrence of the first character in `alphabet` replaced by 'b'. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the first character in `alphabet` that was replaced by 'b' in `s` should be added to `res` if it is different than 'b'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` has the original string with the first occurrence of the first character in `alphabet` replaced by 'b', `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` is updated by adding the first character in `alphabet` where the first character in `alphabet` is different than 'b' in string `s`**
