According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `alphabet`. The loop will always execute since `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` is assigned the string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
