According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `res` contains at least one character from 'alphabet', 'alphabet' has at least one unprocessed lowercase English letter, and `char` is the next character in 'alphabet' after the last processed one. To execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains at least one character from 'alphabet', 'alphabet' has at least one unprocessed lowercase English letter, `char` is the next character in 'alphabet' after the last processed one**
