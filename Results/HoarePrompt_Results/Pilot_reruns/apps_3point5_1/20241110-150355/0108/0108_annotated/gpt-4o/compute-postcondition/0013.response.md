Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 3. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. The program updates the state such that `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` matches `target[j]`. The condition ensures that `i` remains less than the length of `s` and `j` remains less than the length of `target`.***
