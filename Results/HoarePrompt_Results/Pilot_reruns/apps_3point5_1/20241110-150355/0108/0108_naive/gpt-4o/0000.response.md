Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the input string `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' simultaneously. It checks if the characters match, and if they do, it moves to the next character in the target string. If at the end of the iteration the target string has been completely matched, it prints the target string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program is correct and covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
