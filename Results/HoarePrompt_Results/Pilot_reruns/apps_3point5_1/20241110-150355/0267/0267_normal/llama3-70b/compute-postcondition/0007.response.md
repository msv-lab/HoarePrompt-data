Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the formula provided. The value of `i` is not given, so it is unknown. The calculation involves exponentiation and subtraction, which could result in a new value for `dp[n, k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` has been updated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` has been updated based on the formula provided**
