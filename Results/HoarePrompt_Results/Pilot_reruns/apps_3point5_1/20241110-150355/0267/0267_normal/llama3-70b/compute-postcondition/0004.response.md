Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. After the execution of the if statement, if the pair (n, k) is already present in `dp`, then the function returns the value stored in `dp` corresponding to the pair (n, k). Otherwise, there are no changes to the values of `n`, `k`, and `dp. `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`.**
