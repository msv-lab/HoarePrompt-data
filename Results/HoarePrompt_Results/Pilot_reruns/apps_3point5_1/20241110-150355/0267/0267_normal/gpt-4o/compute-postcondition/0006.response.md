Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. The `total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD if func_1(num, k) is true, where `num` is equal to `l + 1. If func_1(l + 1, k) is true, then `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + l + 1) % MOD. Otherwise, `total_sum` remains unchanged.***
