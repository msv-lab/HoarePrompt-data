According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `num` is within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. The `total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD if func_1(num, k) is true. If func_1(l + 1, k) is true, then `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + l + 1) % MOD. Otherwise, `total_sum` remains unchanged.

For the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `num` should be the next number after `r`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`l` is equal to `r + 1`, `r` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD if func_1(num, k) is true.**
