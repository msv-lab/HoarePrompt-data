The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the function calculates the total sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the function `func_1(num, k)` and then takes the modulo MOD of this total sum. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, calculate the total sum of numbers that satisfy `func_1(num, k)` in the range from `l` to `r`, and then return the result after taking the modulo MOD.
