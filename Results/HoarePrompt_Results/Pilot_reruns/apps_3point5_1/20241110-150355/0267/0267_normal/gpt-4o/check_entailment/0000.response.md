Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function correctly checks if the number of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
- The `func_2` function iterates through numbers in the range [l, r], checks if they satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, and updates the total sum accordingly by taking the modulo MOD. It handles the case where l > r by returning 0, and the case where l = r by evaluating `func_1(l, k)` once to determine the total sum.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and there are no edge cases identified where the code fails to meet the requirements.
