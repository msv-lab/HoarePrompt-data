According to the code, the loop will execute for i ranging from 1 to k-1. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 9. To set the states for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the values to k is greater than 1 and i is 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 9, i is 1**
