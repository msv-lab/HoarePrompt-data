According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range [1, k), meaning `i` is less than k. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a new calculated value, i is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a new calculated value, i is 4**
