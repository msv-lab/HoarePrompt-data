Example Answer:
The value of dp[n, k] is updated by adding 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)). The previous value of dp[n, k] is 999999999, and i is 2. After the calculation, the new value of dp[n, k] will be 900000000. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 900000000, i is 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 900000000, i is 2**
