According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 900000000, i is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 900000000, i is 3**
