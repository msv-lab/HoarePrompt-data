Example Answer:
The value of dp[n, k] is updated by adding the result of the calculation provided. The previous value of dp[n, k] is 9, so after the execution, the new value of dp[n, k] is 999999999. The value of i remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 999999999, i is 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value of 999999999, i is 1**
