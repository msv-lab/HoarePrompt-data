Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` and taking the modulo operation with MOD. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. After execution, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + l) % MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated according to the formula `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the formula `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
