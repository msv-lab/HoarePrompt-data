According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified by `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is updated based on the formula (total_sum + l) % MOD, `num` is equal to `l`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. This ensures that the loop will execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: *total_sum is updated based on the formula (total_sum + l) % MOD, num is equal to l, and l is less than or equal to r*
