According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is now equal to `l`.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
