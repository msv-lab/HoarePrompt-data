Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program consists of two functions that accurately implement the problem description. 
- The func_1 function correctly determines if a given number contains at most k different digits.
- The func_2 function calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that satisfy the condition of having at most k different digits by utilizing func_1 within a loop.

Both functions adhere to the problem description and handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The annotations also align with the logic of the code and do not introduce any conflicting scenarios. Therefore, based on the code implementation and the problem description, the correctness of the program is confirmed to be True.
