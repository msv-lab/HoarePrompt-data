The function func_1 accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer. It then converts `n` to a string, creates a set of its digits, and checks if the number of unique digits is less than or equal to `k`. The function returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise.
