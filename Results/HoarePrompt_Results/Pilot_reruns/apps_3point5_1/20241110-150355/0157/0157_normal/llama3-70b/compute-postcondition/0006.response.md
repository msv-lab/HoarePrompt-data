Functionality: **The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and prints the result of adding this minimum value multiplied by 1, 2, and 4. The function does not return any specific message based on the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c as mentioned in the annotations.**
