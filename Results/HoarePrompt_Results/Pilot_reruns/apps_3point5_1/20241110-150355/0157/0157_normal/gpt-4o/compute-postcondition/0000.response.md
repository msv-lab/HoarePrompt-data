Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` can range from 1 to 1000 based on the given precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` and `c` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` and `c` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000**
