Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are known, so we can calculate the value of `min_lemon`. If `a` is 100, `b` is 8, and `c` is 16, then `min_lemon` will be 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
