Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are known to be input integers and positive integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, `max_lemons` will be the minimum of these values. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
