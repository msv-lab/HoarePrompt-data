Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `b` can be any positive integer between 1 and 1000. The variables `a` and `c` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
