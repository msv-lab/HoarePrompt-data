Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the difference between Vasya's favorite number and the first element of the sequence is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements. If the condition is satisfied, then it prints 'YES', indicating that Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This logic covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
