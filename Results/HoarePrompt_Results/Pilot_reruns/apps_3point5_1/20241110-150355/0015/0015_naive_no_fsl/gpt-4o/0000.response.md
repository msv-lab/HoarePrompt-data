Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence s and outputs "YES" if it does and "NO" if it doesn't. The conditions in the if-elif-else block cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The code handles cases where b is equal to a, where c is 0, and where (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. Therefore, the program is correct.
