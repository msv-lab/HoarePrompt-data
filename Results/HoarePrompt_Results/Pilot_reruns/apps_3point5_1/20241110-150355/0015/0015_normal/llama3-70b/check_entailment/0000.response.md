Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the difference between the favorite number 'b' and the first element of the sequence 'a' is divisible by the difference 'c' between consecutive elements. If 'c' is 0, it directly checks if 'a' is equal to 'b'. The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming its correctness.
