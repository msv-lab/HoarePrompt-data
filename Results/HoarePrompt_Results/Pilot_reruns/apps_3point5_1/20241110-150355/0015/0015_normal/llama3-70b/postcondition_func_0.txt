The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
