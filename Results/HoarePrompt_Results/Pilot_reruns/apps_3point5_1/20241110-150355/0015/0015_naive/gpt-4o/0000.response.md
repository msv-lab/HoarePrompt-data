Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly checks if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence s based on the input values of a, b, and c. 
1. If b is equal to a, it prints 'YES', which covers the case where Vasya's favorite number is the first element of the sequence.
2. If c is 0, it prints 'NO', which covers the case where there is no difference between elements and b cannot be reached.
3. If (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES', which covers the case where Vasya's favorite number can be reached in the sequence.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO', ensuring that all other cases are handled correctly.
Overall, the program covers all scenarios described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
