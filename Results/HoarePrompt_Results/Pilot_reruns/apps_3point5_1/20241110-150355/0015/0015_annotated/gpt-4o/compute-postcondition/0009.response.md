Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then checks if `b` is equal to `a`, in which case it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, it further checks if `c` is 0, in which case it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is met. If this condition holds true, it prints 'YES', indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is evenly divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function covers scenarios where the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c` or the division result is negative, providing a comprehensive output based on the relationships between the input values. The function does not have any return value.**
