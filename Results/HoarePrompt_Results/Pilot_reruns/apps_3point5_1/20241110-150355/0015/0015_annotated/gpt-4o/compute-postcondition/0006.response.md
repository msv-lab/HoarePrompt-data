Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input. If `c` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is met, 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is evenly divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative. In all other cases where the condition is not satisfied, 'NO' is printed. The program accounts for scenarios where the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c` or the division result is negative, ensuring a comprehensive handling of edge cases.***
