Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are dependent on the user input. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input**
