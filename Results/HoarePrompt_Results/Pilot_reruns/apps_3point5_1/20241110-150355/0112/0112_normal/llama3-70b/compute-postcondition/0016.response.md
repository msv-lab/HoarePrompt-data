Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, then reads `n` lists of integers into a variable `cubes`. It extracts unique digits from all cubes and removes '0' if present. After that, it calculates the maximum number that can be formed by sorting and joining the unique digits in reverse order. Finally, it prints this maximum number. The function does not accept any parameters and executes its body to produce the output as described.**
