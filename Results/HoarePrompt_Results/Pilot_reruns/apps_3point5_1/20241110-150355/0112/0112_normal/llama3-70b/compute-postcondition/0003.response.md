According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube (list of integers), the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the state needs to be adjusted such that the cubes list has at least 1 cube, and the cube being iterated over is the first cube in the list. Additionally, the digits set is empty at the start of the loop.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the list**
