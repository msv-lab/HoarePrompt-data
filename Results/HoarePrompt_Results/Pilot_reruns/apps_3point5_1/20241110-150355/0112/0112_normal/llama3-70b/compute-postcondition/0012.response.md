Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing unique string representations of all digits in the cubes combined without '0', `cube` is the last cube in the list. If `cubes` is an empty list, `digits` remains an empty set and the loop does not execute. After the execution of the if statement, if '0' is in the set `digits`, it is removed.***
