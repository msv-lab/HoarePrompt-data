According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and `False` otherwise, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is `True` if the condition is met and `False` otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and `False` otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is `True` if the condition is met and `False` otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
