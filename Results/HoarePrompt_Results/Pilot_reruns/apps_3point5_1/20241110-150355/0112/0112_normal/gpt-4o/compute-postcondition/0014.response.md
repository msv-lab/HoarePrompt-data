According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `digit` needs to be updated to the next digit in the `digits` list.
- If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` should be set to True.
- `found` should be updated based on whether the condition is met or not.

State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, adjustments made based on the condition check in the loop body.**
