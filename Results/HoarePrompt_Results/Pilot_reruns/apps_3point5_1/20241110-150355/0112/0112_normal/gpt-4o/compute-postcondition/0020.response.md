Output State: 
- `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`
- `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise
- `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list
- `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is terminated
- If the list `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False
- If none of the conditions in the loop are met, `found` remains False and the loop continues to iterate through the digits.
