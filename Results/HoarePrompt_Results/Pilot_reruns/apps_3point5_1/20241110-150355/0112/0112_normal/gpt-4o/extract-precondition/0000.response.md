**Precondition:**

- n is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha got for her birthday, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3.
- cube_faces is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes.
- Each integer a_{i}_{j} in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9).
- The cubes can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.
