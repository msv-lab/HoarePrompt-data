According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Since `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values, it does not affect the loop execution. At the start of the loop, for the loop to execute, the `digit` variable needs to take the value of the first digit in the `digits` list.
State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list**
