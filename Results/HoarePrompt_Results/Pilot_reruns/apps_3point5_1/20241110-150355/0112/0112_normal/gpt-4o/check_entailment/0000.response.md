Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
- The function `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the cube faces provided by iterating through each digit and checking if a corresponding cube face is available. If all digits can be formed, it returns True.
- The function `func_1` iterates through increasing values of `x` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the condition of the `can_form_number` function.
- The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the code and do not introduce any additional cases that the code does not handle.
- Based on the code implementation, it seems to cover all potential cases and correctly determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes.
