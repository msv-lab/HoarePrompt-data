Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and `False` otherwise, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is `True` if the condition is met and `False` otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the condition is satisfied.***
