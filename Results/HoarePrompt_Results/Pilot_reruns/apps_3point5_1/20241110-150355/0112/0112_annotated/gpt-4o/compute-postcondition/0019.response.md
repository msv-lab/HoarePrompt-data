According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with the first element set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first character in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, and `used_cubes[i]` is True if the condition in the if statement is met**
