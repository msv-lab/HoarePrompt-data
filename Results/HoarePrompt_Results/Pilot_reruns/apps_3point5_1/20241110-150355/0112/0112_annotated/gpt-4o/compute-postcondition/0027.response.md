According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the `digits` list to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `found` is False and `digits` has at least one more element to iterate over. Since `digits` has at least one more element to iterate over, the loop will execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least one more element to iterate over**
