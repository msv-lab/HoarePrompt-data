Postcondition: ***The loop iterates through `n` times, checking if the `i-th` cube face has been used and if the `digit` is in that cube face. If the condition is met, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the loop completes without finding a suitable cube face, `found` remains False. If the loop does not start due to `n` being 0 or `digits` being empty, all variables retain their initial states. In all cases, if `found` is False, the function returns False.***
