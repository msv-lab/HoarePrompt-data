The function func_1 accepts two parameters `n` and `cubes`. It iterates over values of `x` starting from 0 until the condition can_form_number(x + 1) is False. The function then returns the final value of `x`. If can_form_number(1) is True but can_form_number(2) is False, `cube_faces` remains the same, and `x` is 1. If can_form_number(3) is True, `cube_faces` remains the same, and `x` is 3. The actual functionality may differ from what the annotations suggest, so it's essential to consider the code's behavior in each case.
