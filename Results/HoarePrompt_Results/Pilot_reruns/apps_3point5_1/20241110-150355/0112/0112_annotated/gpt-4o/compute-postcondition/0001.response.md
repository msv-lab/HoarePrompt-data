Example Answer:
A list `used_cubes` is created with `False` repeated `n` times. The previous values are not provided, but it is clear that all elements in `used_cubes` are initialized as `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values**
