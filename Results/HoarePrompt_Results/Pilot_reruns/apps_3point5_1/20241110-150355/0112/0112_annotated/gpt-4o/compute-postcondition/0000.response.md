Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of characters obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string and then converting each character to an element in a list. The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, so the output state is `digits` is a list of characters.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters**
