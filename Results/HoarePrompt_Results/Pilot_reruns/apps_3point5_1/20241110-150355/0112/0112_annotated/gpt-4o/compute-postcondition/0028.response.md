Output State: 
The loop iterates through `n` times, checking if the `i-th` cube face has been used and if the `digit` is in that cube face. If the condition is met, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the loop completes without finding a suitable cube face, `found` remains False. If the loop does not start due to `n` being 0 or `digits` being empty, all variables retain their initial states. In all cases, if `found` is False, the function returns False.

If there are no cube faces or digits to iterate over, the loop does not execute and all variables retain their initial states.

Output State after the loop executes:
- If the loop does not execute: All variables retain their initial states.
- If the loop executes: `found` is False. `digits` may have at least one more element to iterate over.
