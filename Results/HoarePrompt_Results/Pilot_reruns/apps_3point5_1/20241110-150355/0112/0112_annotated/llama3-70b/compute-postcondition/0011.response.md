Example Answer:
The code removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. If '0' was present in the set, it is now removed. The set `digits` may or may not have contained '0' before this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from all the cubes in the `cubes` set except '0'.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from all the cubes in the `cubes` set except '0'**
