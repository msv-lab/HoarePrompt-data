Correctness: **False**

In the provided code, the function takes input for the number of cubes and the numbers on each face of the cubes. It then finds the maximum possible total sum by selecting one face from each cube, ensuring no two selected faces have the same number. However, the code does not fully adhere to the problem description.

The code does not account for the restriction that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice versa by rotating the cubes. This means that the code may potentially generate incorrect results in cases where the numbers 6 and 9 are involved.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
