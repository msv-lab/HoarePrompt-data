According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` set. If there are more cubes in the set, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, and `cubes` is a non-empty set. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next cube in the `cubes` set should be available, and the `digits` set should be updated accordingly with the string representations of digits from that cube.
State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set with one less cube available**
