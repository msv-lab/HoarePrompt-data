According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `len(s)`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` has been increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` should be 2).
- `j` should be incremented by 1.
- No adjustment needed for `len(s)` and `target_len`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, `j` has been increased by 2**
