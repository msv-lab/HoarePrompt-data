According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` has been increased by 3 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, else `j` remains the same. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be less than the length of string `s` and `j` should be adjusted to be less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of string `s`, `j` is less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
