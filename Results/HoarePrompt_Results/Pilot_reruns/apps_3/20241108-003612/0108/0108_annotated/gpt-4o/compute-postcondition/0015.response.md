According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and the condition `s[i] == target[j]`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` should be less than the length of string `s`.
2. `j` should be less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
