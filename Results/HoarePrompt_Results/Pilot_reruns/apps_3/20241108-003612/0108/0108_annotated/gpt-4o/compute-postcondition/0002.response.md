Example Answer:
`target_len` is assigned the length of the string `target` which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and has a length of 26 characters. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26**
