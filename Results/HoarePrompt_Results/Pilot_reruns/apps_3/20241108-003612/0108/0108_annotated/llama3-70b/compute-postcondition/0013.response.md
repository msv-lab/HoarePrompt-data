Output State: **If 's' contains 'a' then res will be a string of 'a's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in the original 's'. 's' will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', and char will remain 'a'. If 's' does not contain 'a' the loop will not execute, and res will remain an empty string, 's' will remain unchanged, and char will be the first character in the alphabet.**
