Example Answer:
`char` is added to the end of `res`, where `char` is the first character in the alphabet. Since `char` is 'a', after execution, `res` becomes 'a'. The states of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `res` is 'a', `char` is the first character in the alphabet**
