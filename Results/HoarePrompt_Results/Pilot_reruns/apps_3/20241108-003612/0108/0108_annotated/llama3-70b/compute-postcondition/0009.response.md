According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'ba', `res` is 'aa', and `char` is 'a'. For the loop to execute one more time, the `char` variable should still be present in the updated `s` string after the last iteration. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is 'ba', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
