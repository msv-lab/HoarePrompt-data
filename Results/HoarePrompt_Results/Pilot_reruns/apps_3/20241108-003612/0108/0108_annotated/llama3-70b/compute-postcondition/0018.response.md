Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated by concatenating the value of `char`, which is 'a'. If 's' contains 'a', then the length of `res` will increase by 1, and `char` will remain 'a'. 's' will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b'. Therefore, the Output State is: If 's' contains 'a', `res` will be a string of 'a's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in 's', 's' will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', and `char` will remain 'a'.
Output State: **If 's' contains 'a', `res` will be a string of 'a's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in 's', 's' will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', and `char` will remain 'a'**
