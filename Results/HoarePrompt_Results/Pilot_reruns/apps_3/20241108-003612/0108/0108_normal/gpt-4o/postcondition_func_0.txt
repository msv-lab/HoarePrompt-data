The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It then iterates through `s` and checks if it matches the predefined `target` string, printing `target` if there is a match, and -1 if there isn't. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include an empty `s` string, a `target` string with a length of 0, and scenarios where `s` and `target` have no common characters.
