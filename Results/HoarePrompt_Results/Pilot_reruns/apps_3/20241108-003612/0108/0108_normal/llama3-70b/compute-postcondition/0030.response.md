Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet in string `s`. The replacement occurs only once. The value of `char` is incremented to the next character in the alphabet. If 'a' is in `s`, it will be replaced with 'b'. The output state after execution is: If 'a' is in `s`, `s` does not contain 'a' but contains 'b', `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' replaced with the next character in the alphabet until 'a' is no longer in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`.
Output State: **If 'a' is in `s`, `s` does not contain 'a' but contains 'b', `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' replaced with the next character in the alphabet until 'a' is no longer in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`**
