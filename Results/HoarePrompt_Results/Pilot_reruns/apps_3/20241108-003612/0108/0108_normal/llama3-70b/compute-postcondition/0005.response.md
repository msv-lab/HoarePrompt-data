Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. Since `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string, which is 'a', and 'b' comes after 'a' in the alphabet, the first occurrence of 'a' in `s` will be replaced with 'b'. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of 'a' with 'b'.
Output State: **`s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of 'a' with 'b'**
