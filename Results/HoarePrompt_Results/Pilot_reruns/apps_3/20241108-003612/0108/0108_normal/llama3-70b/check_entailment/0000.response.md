Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that if the input string does not contain the letter 'a' initially, the code will not perform any replacements and will output -1, even though it might be possible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence by starting with a different letter. This missing edge case is not handled by the code. So, the correctness of the code is false.
