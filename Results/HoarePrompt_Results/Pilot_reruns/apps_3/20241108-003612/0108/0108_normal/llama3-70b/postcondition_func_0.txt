Functionality: The function reads a string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters. It then iterates through each character of the alphabet and replaces occurrences of that character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet until 'a' is no longer in `s`. If the resulting string `res` has a length of 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. There is a missing edge case where if `s` does not contain 'a' initially, the function does not perform any replacements, and the final output will be -1.
