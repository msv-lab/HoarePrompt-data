Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three integers as input representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the ratios provided in the problem description. The total number of fruits is calculated by multiplying the number of lemons by 1, apples by 2, and pears by 4. Finally, the code prints the total number of fruits which Nikolay can use to cook the compote.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given ratios. The output hints also agree with the code, as it accurately describes the functionality of the code and the calculation of the total number of fruits.
