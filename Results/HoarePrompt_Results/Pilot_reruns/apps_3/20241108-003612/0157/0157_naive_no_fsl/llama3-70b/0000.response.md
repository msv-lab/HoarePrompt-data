Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote by finding the minimum of the number of lemons, apples divided by 2, and pears divided by 4. It then calculates the total number of fruits based on this minimum value. The logic follows the described ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The program works as expected for all cases and there are no edge cases identified where it fails to provide the correct output.
