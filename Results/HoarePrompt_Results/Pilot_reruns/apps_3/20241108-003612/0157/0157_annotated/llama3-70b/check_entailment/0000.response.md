Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It ensures that the fruits are used in the ratio 1:2:4 as required by the problem description. The calculation of `min_lemon` ensures that the minimum possible number of lemons is considered based on the number of apples and pears available. The final calculation of the sum of lemons, apples, and pears follows the correct ratio. The program handles the case where there might not be enough pears to cook any compote by returning 0, as described in the problem description. All provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.
