Example Answer:
The value of `min_lemon` is determined by finding the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, the sum of `min_lemon`, `min_lemon * 2`, and `min_lemon * 4` is printed. The output state is `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the sum of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` is calculated.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the sum of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` is calculated**
