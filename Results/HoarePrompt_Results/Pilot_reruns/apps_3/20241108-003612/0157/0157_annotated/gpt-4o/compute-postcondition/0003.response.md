Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. Therefore, `max_lemons` will be the minimum value among the inputs divided by 2 for `b` and divided by 4 for `c`. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
