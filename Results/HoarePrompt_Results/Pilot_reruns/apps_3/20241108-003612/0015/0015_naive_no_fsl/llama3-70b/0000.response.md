Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the difference between Vasya's favorite number and the first element of the sequence is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements, and if the result is greater than or equal to 0. It handles the case when the difference between neighboring elements is 0 separately. The logic in the program is sound and covers all possibilities as described in the problem statement.
