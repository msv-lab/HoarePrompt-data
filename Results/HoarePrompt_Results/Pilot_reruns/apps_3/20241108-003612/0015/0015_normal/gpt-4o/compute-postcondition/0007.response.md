Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integer values within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is 0, the program prints 'NO'. If (b - a) % c is equal to 0 and (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.***
