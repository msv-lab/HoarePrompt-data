Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, it prints 'YES', which is in line with the problem description.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements of the sequence is 0, it prints 'NO', which is also as per the problem description.
3. If the favorite number is reachable from the first element of the sequence based on the difference between neighboring elements, it prints 'YES', as expected.
4. If the favorite number is not reachable from the first element of the sequence based on the difference between neighboring elements, it prints 'NO', which aligns with the problem description.
Therefore, the code is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
