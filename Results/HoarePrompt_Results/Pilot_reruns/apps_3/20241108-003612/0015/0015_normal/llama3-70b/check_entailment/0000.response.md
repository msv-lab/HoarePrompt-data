Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
1. When the difference between any two neighboring elements in the sequence is 0 (c=0), the code correctly checks if the first element (a) is equal to Vasya's favorite number (b) and prints 'YES' if they are equal, otherwise 'NO'.
2. When the difference is non-zero, the code verifies the conditions ((b - a) % c == 0) and ((b - a) / c >= 0) to determine if Vasya's favorite number (b) appears in the sequence. This logic correctly handles scenarios where the favorite number is in the sequence and where it is not, ensuring accurate output. 

Therefore, the code is correct as it covers all cases described in the problem statement.
