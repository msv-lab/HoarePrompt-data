Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the problem description. It checks if the favorite number b appears in the sequence based on the provided formula and conditions. It handles the case when the difference c is zero separately and checks if a and b are equal. It also correctly calculates whether b can be obtained from the sequence based on the difference c. The program covers all the possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and gives the correct output for each case. Hence, the program is correct.
