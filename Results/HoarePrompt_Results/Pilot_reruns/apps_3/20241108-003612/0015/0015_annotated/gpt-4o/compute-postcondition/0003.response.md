Example Answer:
The code `print('YES')` simply outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input and are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input**
