Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'. The program handles all cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers and checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative. The output depends on whether the condition is met or not.***
