Functionality: **The function `func` takes three input integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. It then checks the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If `c` is 0, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it prints 'YES' if the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` is satisfied, otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. The provided annotations give insight into the expected behavior based on different conditions, but the actual code execution determines the output.**
