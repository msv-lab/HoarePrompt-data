Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where Masha can't make even number 1. The program simply removes '0' from the digits set and finds the maximum number that can be formed. However, if there is no '1' present in the digits set, then the output should be 0 because Masha can't even make the number 1. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
0 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 0 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9
```
In this case, Masha cannot form the number 1, so the expected output should be 0.
