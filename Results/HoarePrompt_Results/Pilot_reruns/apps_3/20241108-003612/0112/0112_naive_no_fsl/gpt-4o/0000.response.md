Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where Masha can't make any number from 1 to x. The program only increments x and checks if it can form the number x + 1, but it does not consider the scenario where Masha can't form any number. Additionally, the program does not consider the restrictions on forming the number 6 and 9, as mentioned in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program needs to be revised to handle the case where Masha can't form any number, as well as to take into account the restrictions on forming the number 6 and 9.
