The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a positive integer. The function also has a loop that iterates over each digit in a list `digits`. The loop checks if there is a cube face in `cube_faces` that contains that digit and has not been used before. If such a face is found, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a matching face is not found for any digit, the loop returns False. The loop may not execute if `digits` is empty or if all available cube faces with the required digits have already been used.

If the loop completes successfully without returning False, it returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `num`, iterate over each digit in a list `digits`, and check if there are corresponding cube faces in `cube_faces` that can form the number. It returns True if the number can be formed using the cube faces, otherwise it returns False.
