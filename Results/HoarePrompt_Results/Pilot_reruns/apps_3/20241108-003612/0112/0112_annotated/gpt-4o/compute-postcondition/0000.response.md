Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of individual digits of the number `num` by converting it to a string and then creating a list. The previous values of the affected variables are `num` is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each list contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of the number `num`.**
