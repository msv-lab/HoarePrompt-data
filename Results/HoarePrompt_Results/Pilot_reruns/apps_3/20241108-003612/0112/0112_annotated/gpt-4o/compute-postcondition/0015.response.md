Example Answer:
The boolean value at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list is set to True, indicating that the ith cube face has been used. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the ith element is set to True if it was not used before and the digit is in the corresponding cube face list, `found` is False.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the ith element is set to True if it was not used before and the digit is in the corresponding cube face list, `found` is False**
