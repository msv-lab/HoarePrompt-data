Example Answer:
Each element in the `used_cubes` list is initialized to `False`, and the length of the list is `n`, which represents the number of cubes Masha has. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each list contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of the number `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans initialized to False**
