According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop executes. At the beginning of the loop, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each list contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of the number `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans initialized to False, and `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list.
