Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each list contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube. `num` is a positive integer. `digits` is a list of individual digits of the number `num`. `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the ith element is set to True if not used before and `digit` is in the ith cube face list. `found` is True if a matching cube face is found, False otherwise. `i` is 0. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
