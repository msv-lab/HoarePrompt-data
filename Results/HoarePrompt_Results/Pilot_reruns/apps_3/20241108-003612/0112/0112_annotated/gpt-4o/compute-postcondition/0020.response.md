Output State: **The loop iterates over each cube in `cube_faces` and checks if the `digit` is present on any face that has not been used before. If a matching cube face is found, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True, and `found` is set to True. The loop breaks as soon as a matching cube face is found. If no such cube face is found for the current `digit`, `found` remains False.**
