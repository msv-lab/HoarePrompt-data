Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `can_form_number` is supposed to check if a given number can be formed using the cube faces provided. However, the implementation of the function does not match the problem description.

In the given examples, the code does not handle the case where Masha cannot form a number from 1 to x using the available cubes. The function `can_form_number` does not consider the constraint that Masha cannot make the digit 6 from digit 9 and vice versa using cube rotations.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all the requirements specified in the problem description.
