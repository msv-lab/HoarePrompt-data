According to the code, the loop will execute for each digit in the list until there are no more digits left. At the end of the previous iteration, `found` is False, indicating that the desired condition to exit the loop has not been met, and there are more digits in the list to iterate over. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`found` is False, there are more digits in the list to iterate over**
