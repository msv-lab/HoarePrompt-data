According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans, `found` is either True or False, and `i` is 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans, `found` is either True or False, `i` is 1**
