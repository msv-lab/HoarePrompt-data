Output State: **The loop iterates over each digit in the list `digits` and checks if there is a cube face in `cube_faces` that contains that digit and has not been used before. If such a face is found, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a matching face is not found for any digit, the loop returns False. The loop may not execute if `digits` is empty or if all available cube faces with the required digits have already been used.**
