Example Answer: 
The code iterates through each digit in the second cube and updates the `digits` variable with the string representation of each digit. Since the second cube is represented by `cube` and `digits` is updated with the string representation of digits in the second cube, the `digits` variable will be updated accordingly. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, and `cube` is the second cube in the list. After running the code, the `digits` variable will be updated with the string representation of digits in the second cube.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, cube is the second cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the second cube**
