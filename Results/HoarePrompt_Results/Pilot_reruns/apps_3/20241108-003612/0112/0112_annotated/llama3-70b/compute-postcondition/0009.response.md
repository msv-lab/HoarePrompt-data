According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 4 cubes, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, cube is the third cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the third cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 cubes and the cube is the fourth cube in the list, and digits should be updated with the string representation of digits in the fourth cube.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 4 cubes, cube is the fourth cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the fourth cube**
