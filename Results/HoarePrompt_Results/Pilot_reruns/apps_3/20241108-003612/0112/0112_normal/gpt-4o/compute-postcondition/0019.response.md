According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the `i-th` element set to `True`, `found` is True, and `i` is 2. 

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 since the loop checks if `i` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the `i-th` element set to `True`, `found` is True, and `i` is 3**
