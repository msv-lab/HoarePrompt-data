According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `digits` contains at least one digit. Additionally, for the loop to execute, the `used_cubes` list needs to have `n` elements. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, so it doesn't need to be adjusted. The `digits` list containing individual digits of `num` needs to be adjusted to contain at least one digit. The `used_cubes` list needs to be adjusted to have `n` elements set to `False`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`**
