According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is set to `True` if not already used, `found` is True, `i` is 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the list.
- If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` should be set to True and `found` should be set to True.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the `i-th` element set to `True` if not already used, `found` is True, `i` is 2**
