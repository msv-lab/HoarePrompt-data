According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `digits` list. If `digits` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, if `digits` is empty, the function returns False without any changes to the state. If `digits` is not empty, the loop iterates through the elements of `used_cubes`, checking for matches and updating the state accordingly. The final state will have `used_cubes` updated based on the matches found, `found` set to True if a match was found, and `i` equal to the number of iterations that occurred.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
State: **`used_cubes` updated based on matches found, `found` set to True if a match was found, `i` incremented by 1**
