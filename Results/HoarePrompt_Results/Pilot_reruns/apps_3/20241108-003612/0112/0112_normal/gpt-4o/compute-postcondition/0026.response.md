Example Answer: 
The variable `found` is initialized as False. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `used_cubes` updated based on matches found, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `digits` has more elements left to iterate through.
Output State: **`used_cubes` updated based on matches found, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `digits` has more elements left to iterate through**
