The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then reads `n` lists of integers and collects all digits from these lists into a set `digits`. It removes '0' from `digits` if it exists. It then constructs the largest number possible from the digits in descending order and prints this number. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
