Example Answer:
The code updates the `digits` set by adding the string representation of each digit in the `cube`. Since `cube` is the second cube in the list, the set `digits` will be updated with the string representations of the digits in the second cube. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the second cube, `cube` is the second cube in the list**.
