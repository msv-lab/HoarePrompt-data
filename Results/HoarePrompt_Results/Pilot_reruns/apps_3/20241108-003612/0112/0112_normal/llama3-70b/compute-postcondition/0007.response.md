According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 3 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the second cube, `cube` is the second cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 3 cubes, and `cube` should be the third cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the third cube, `cube` is the third cube in the list**
