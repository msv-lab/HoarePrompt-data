Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the string representations of the digits in the third cube. Since the cube is the third cube in the list, we can assume that the list `cubes` contains at least 3 cubes. The set `digits` now contains the string representations of the digits from the third cube. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the third cube.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the third cube**
