Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to check if a number contains at most $k$ different digits and calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ that meet this condition, respectively. The `func_1` function correctly returns True if the number contains at most $k$ different digits. The `func_2` function iterates through the range of numbers from $l$ to $r$ and adds the numbers that satisfy the condition to the total sum, which is then returned modulo $998244353$. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
