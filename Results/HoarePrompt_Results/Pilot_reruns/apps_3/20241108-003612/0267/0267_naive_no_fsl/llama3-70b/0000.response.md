Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a function `count` to calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits in a given range.
2. The main function `func_1` calculates the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits between `l` and `r` using the `count` function and returns the result modulo `998244353`.
3. The program reads input, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the result, which matches the problem description.
4. The logic in the `count` function correctly handles the cases where `n` is less than `10**k`, and for larger `n` values, it calculates the count based on the number of digits and their combinations.
5. The program uses memoization to optimize the calculation and avoid redundant computations.
6. The program works within the constraints specified in the problem description and handles the edge cases properly.
