Output State: 

If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop will not execute, and `total_sum` will remain 0. 
If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop will execute once, updating `total_sum` if `func_1(l, k)` is true.
If `l` is less than `r`, the loop will execute for each `num` in the range `[l, r]`. 
After the loop executes, `total_sum` will contain the sum of all `num` values where `func_1(num, k)` is true, computed as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The final values of `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` will be integers.
