Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is an integer, `num`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to the result of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The value of `num` remains equal to `l` after the operation. `l` is ensured to be less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is ensured to be greater than or equal to `l`.***
