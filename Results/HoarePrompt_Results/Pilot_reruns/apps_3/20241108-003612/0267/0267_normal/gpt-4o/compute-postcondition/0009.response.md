Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `num`, `l`, `r` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num = (l + 1) + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. This update occurs for all valid values of `l` and `r`, ensuring that `total_sum` is always updated correctly based on the conditions specified.***
