Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total_sum` and then the result is taken modulo `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `total_sum` is the new value after adding `num` and taking modulo `MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is the new value after adding `num` and taking modulo `MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**
