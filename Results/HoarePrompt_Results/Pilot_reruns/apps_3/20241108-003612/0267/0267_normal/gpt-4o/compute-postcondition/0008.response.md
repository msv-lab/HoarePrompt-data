Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The value of `num` is equal to `(l + 1) + 1`, where `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated according to the condition `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `(l + 1) + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the condition `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `(l + 1) + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**
