According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is 2. Since the loop starts from 1, `i` will be 1 after the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `k`, which means `i` needs to be less than 2. Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is `k`.
State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 1, `dp` dictionary now stores the updated value for key (n, k)**
