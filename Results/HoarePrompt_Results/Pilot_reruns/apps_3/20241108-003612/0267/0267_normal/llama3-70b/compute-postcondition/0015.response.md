Example Answer:
The value of the key (n, k) in the dictionary dp is updated by performing the modulo operation with MOD. Since n is 0, k is 1, and dp already stores the updated value for key (0, 1), the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 1, `dp` dictionary still stores the updated value for key (0, 1)**
