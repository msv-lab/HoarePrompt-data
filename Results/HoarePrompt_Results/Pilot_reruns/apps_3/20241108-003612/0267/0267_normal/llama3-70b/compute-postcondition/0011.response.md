Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The current values of `n`, `k`, and `dp` are used in the calculation. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are given, and `i` is not defined, the result of the expression cannot be calculated precisely. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 0, `k` is 1, and the updated value for key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`.
Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 1, and the updated value for key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`**
