Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is 9. The output state is: `n` is 0, `k` is 2, and `dp` dictionary now stores the updated value for key (n, k).
Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 2, `dp` dictionary now stores the updated value for key (n, k)**
