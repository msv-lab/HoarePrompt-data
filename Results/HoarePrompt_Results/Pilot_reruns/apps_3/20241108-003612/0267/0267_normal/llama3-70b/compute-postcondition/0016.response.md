Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the corresponding value. If n < 10 ** k, `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is calculated based on the provided formula and stored in the dictionary. In the case where n is 0 and k is 1, the updated value for key (0, 1) is stored in the dictionary. The modulo operation with MOD is performed on the final value of `dp[n, k]`.***
