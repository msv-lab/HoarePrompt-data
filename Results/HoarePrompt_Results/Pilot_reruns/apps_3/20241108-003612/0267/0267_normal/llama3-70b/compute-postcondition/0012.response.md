According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is 1. Since the loop starts from 1 and excludes the value of `k`, the loop will not execute in the current state. To execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 2, updated value for key (n, k) in dictionary `dp`**
