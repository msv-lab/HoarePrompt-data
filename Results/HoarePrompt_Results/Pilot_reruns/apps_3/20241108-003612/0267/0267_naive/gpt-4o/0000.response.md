Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in the input integers $l$, $r$, and $k$, and then iterates through all numbers from $l$ to $r$ (inclusive). For each number, it checks if the number of unique digits in the number is less than or equal to $k$ using the `func_1` function. If it is, then the number is added to the total sum modulo $998244353$. The program then returns the total sum.

The program follows the problem description accurately by calculating the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits and returns the correct result for all potential cases.
