Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the annotations, it can be observed that the program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function checks if a given number `n` contains at most `k` different digits. The `func_2` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition specified in `func_1` modulo `MOD`, where `l` and `r` are within the constraints provided in the problem description.

The `func_1` function correctly determines if a number contains at most `k` different digits, and the `func_2` function correctly calculates the sum of numbers between `l` and `r` that meet this condition. Additionally, the program handles the constraints specified in the problem description for the input values of `l`, `r`, and `k`.

Furthermore, the examples provided in the problem description are consistent with the expected output of the program. Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the problem description, the code is correct for all potential cases.
