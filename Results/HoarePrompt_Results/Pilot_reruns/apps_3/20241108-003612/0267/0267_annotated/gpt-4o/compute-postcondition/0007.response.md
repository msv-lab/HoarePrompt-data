According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is equal to `l % MOD`, `num` is `l + 1`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. To execute one more time, `num` should be incremented by 1, `l` should be incremented by 1, and `num` should still be less than or equal to `r`.
State: **`total_sum` is equal to `l % MOD`, `num` is `l + 2`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
