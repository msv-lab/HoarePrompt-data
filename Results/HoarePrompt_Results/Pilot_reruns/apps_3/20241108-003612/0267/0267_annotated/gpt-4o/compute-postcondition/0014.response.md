Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If the loop executes, `total_sum` is the sum of all numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`, and the function returns `total_sum`. The function calculates the sum of numbers between `l` and `r` based on a condition from `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`.**
