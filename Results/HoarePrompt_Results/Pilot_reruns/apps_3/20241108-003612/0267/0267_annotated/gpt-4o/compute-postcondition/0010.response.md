According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is equal to `(l + 2 + total_sum) % MOD`, `num` is `l + 2`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 2) % MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `total_sum`, `num`, and `l`, and the program continues with the initial values. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next iteration should have `num` incremented by 1, and `l` should also be incremented by 1 to maintain the condition that `l` is less than or equal to `r`. No other states need adjustment.

State: **`total_sum` is equal to `(l + 2 + total_sum) % MOD`, `num` is `l + 3`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
