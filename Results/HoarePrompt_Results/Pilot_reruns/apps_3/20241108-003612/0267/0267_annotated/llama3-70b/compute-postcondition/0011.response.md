Example Answer: 
`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to its current value. The values of `n` and `k` are not changed. The value of `i` is 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is updated with a new value, `i` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is updated with a new value, `i` is 3**
