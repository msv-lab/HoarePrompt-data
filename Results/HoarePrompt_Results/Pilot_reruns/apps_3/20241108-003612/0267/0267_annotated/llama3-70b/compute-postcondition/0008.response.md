According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1. This means the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, `i` is 2**
