Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute. `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, `i` is the number of times the loop executed, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the given expression**
