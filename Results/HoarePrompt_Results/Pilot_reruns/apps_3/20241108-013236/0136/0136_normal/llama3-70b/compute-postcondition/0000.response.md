Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input string after removing leading zeros using `lstrip('0')`. The input is assumed to be a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros and no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros and no more than 10^6 digits**
