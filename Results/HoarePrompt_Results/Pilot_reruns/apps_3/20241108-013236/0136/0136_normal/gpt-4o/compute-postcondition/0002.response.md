Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated to be the second element of the list `data` with leading zeros stripped. Since `b` is represented as a string, stripping leading zeros does not change its value. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
