Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two non-negative integers a and b from input, removing any leading zeros.
2. It then compares the lengths of a and b. If the length of a is less than b, it prints "<", if the length of a is greater than b, it prints ">", and if the lengths are equal, it compares the values of a and b.
3. If a is less than b, it prints "<", if a is greater than b, it prints ">", and if a is equal to b, it prints "=".
4. The program correctly handles cases where a and b contain leading zeros and compares the numbers as required by the problem description.
5. The logic in the program is correct and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
