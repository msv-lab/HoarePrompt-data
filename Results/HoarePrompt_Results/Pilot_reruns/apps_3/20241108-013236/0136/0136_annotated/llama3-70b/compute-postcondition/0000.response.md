Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the input value after stripping leading zeros. The input can be any non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits**
