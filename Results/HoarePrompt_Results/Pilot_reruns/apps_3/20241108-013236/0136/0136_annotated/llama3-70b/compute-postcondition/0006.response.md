Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. This comprehensive postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases where `a` can be equal to, less than, or greater than `b.***
