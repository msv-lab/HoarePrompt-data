Example Answer: 
The code simply prints '<' to the console. There is no impact on the variables `a` and `b` as they are not used in the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros**
