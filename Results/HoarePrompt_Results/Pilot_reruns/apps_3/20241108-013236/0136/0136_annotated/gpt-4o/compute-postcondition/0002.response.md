Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `data` after removing any leading zeros. Therefore, `b` is updated based on the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros. The value of `a` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a` is the first element of the list `data` without leading zeros, `b` is updated based on `data[1] without leading zeros`**
