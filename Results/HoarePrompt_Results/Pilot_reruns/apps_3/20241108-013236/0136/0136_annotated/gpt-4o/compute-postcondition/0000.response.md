Example Answer:
The input is split and stored in the list `data`. The values of `a` and `b` are now represented as strings in the list `data`. The variables `a` and `b` are not directly affected, but their values can be accessed through the list `data`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings in the list `data`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings in the list `data`**
