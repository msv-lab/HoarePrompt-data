The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers. The function performs a loop where `a` holds the original value of `b`, and `b` holds the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. The loop continues to execute as long as `b` is not equal to 0. If `b` is initially 0, the loop will not execute at all. Finally, the function returns the original value of `b`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, performs a loop where `a` holds the original value of `b` and `b` holds the remainder of original `a` divided by `b`. The loop continues until `b` is 0. Returns the original value of `b`.**
