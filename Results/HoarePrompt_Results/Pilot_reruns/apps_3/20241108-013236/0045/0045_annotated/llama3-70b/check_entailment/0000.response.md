Correctness: False

The provided code only contains a function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it does not generate the strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers that sum up to n with the maximum possible greatest common divisor as required by the problem description. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
