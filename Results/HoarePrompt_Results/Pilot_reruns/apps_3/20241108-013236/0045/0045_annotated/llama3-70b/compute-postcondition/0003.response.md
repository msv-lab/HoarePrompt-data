According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `b` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments to the state.
State: **`a` holds the original value of `b`, `b` holds the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, and `b` is not equal to 0**
