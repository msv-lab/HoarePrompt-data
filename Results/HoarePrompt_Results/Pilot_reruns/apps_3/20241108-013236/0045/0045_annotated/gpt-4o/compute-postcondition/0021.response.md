According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `k - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 10^10. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is adjusted accordingly; `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1; `k` is decreased by 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop. `remainder` is decreased by 1. `k` is greater than 1**
