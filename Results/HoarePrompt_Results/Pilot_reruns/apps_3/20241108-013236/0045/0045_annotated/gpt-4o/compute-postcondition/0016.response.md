According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `k - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is adjusted accordingly, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1. If `remainder` is 0, the loop breaks. 

To execute one more time, the value of `i` should be within the range from `k - 2` to 0. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k - 1`. Additionally, since `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 and `remainder` is decreased by 1, those adjustments need to be reflected as well.

State: **Output State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is adjusted accordingly; `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1; `k` is decreased by 1**
