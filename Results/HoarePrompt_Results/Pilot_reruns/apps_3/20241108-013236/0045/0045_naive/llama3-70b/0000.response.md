Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two inputs, n and k, and then creates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor of the sequence is maximal. The program then outputs the resulting sequence or -1 if no such sequence exists.

The program iterates through numbers from 1 to k, adding the number to the sequence if n is greater than or equal to the number, and subtracting the number from n. If the sequence is not of length k by the end of the loop, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the sequence.

For all inputs and potential cases, the program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output.
