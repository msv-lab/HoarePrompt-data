According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is at least 1**
