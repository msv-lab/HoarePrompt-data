According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `k-1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 2`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, `k` is at least 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to move within the specified range.
2. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, so the condition of `remainder` being equal to 0 should be considered.

State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 2`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, `k` is at least 1**
