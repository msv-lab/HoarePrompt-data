Postcondition: ***`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 2`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, `k` is at least 1. If the `remainder` is 0, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
