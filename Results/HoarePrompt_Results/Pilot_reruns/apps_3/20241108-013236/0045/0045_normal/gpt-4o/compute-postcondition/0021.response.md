According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range specified in the for loop. If `i` is greater than or equal to the start value of the range (-1 in this case), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 3`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, `k` is at least 1. If the `remainder` is 0, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `remainder` is decremented by 1. 
To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the start value of the range specified in the for loop (k - 1 in this case). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 3`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, `k` is at least 1**
