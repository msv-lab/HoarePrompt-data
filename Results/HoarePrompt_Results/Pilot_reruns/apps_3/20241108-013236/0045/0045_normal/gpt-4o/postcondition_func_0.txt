The function `func_1` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`. If the calculated `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns -1, indicating an error. Otherwise, it constructs a list `sequence` by incrementing values based on certain conditions. If `k` is at least 1 and `remainder` is positive, the loop will update the elements of `sequence`. If `remainder` becomes 0 during the loop, it will break. If `k` is less than 1 or `remainder` is non-positive, the loop will not execute, and the function will return the original `sequence`.
