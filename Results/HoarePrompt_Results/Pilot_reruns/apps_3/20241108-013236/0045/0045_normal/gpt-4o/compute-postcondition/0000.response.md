Example Answer:
The value of `min_sum` is calculated by multiplying `k` with `k + 1` and then dividing by 2. Since `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^10, the result of the calculation will also be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer**
