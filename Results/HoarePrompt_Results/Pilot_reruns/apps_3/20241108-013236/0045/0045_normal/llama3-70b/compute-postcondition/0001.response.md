According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (i.e., not 0, None, False, or an empty collection), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` have been swapped. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `b` is truthy after the swap. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` have been swapped and `b` is truthy**
