The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. The constraints for these parameters are that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. The loop within the function will continue to execute until `b` evaluates to 0. After the loop finishes, `a` will contain the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0. If `b` is initially 0, the loop will not execute. The function returns the value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and return the resulting value.
