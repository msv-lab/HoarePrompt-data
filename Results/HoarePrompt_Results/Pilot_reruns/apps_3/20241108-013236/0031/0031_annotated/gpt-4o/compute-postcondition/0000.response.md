Example Answer: 
The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `10 ** 6 + 3`, which is 1000003. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; MOD is 1000003.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; MOD is 1000003**
