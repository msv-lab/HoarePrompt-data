Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying `denominator` with `total_days` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - (i+1)) % MOD`, `denominator` is an updated value, `i` is incremented by 1. After executing the code, the new value of `denominator` will depend on the previous values of the variables.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - (i+1)) % MOD`, `denominator` is an updated value, `i` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `denominator` is calculated by multiplying the previous `denominator` with `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD`**
