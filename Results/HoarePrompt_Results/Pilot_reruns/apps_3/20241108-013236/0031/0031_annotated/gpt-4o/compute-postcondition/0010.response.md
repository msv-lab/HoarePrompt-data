According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is updated value. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is updated value, `i` is incremented by 1**
