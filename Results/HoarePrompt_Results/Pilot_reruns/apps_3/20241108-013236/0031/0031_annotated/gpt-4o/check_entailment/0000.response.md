Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days, given k people. The code handles the cases where k is greater than 2^n, where the probability is guaranteed to be 1, and calculates the probability using the provided formula otherwise. The code also reduces the fraction A/B to its irreducible form as required. All the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code, and the annotations align with the logic of the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
