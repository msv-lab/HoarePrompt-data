Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1` with parameters `A` and `B`. The variables `n`, `k`, `MOD`, `total_days`, `numerator`, `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, `A`, and `B` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` contains the product of (total_days - i) for i ranging from 0 to k-1, `denominator` contains the product of total_days for i ranging from 0 to k-1, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1` with parameters `A` and `B`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` contains the product of (total_days - i) for i ranging from 0 to k-1, `denominator` contains the product of total_days for i ranging from 0 to k-1, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1` with parameters `A` and `B`**.
