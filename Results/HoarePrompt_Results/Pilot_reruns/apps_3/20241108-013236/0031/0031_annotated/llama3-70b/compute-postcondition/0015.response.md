Example Answer:
The `numerator` is divided by the `gcd`, which might affect the value of `numerator` based on the previous calculations of `gcd`. Since the initial state is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact value after the division. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the previous calculations and is not explicitly defined.
Output State: **Dependent on previous calculations**
