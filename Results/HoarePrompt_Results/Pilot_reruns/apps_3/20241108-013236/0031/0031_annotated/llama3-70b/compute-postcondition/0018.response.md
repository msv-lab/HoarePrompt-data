The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the function returns the result of the operation `numerator % (10^9 + 7)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, perform a modulo operation on the numerator with (10^9 + 7), and return the result.
