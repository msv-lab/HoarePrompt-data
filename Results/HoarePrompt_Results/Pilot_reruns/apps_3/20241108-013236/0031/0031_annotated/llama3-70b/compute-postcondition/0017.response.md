Example Answer:
The function returns the remainder of the division of `numerator` by (10 ** 6 + 3) and the remainder of the division of `denominator` by (10 ** 6 + 3). Since no specific initial values are given, the output state after running this code is simply the return values of the remainders.
Output State: **function returns numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)**
