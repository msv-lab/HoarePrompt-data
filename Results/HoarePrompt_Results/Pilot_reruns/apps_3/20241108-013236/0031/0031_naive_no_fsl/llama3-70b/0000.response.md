Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days based on the input values of n and k. It uses the formula for calculating the probability and reduces the fraction to its irreducible form. The program then prints the A and B values modulo 10^6 + 3. The implementation follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
