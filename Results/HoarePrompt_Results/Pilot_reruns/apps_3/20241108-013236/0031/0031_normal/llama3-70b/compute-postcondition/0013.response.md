Output State: **If k is greater than 0, then after the loop executes, `numerator` will be the product of `total_days` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1) multiplied by (`total_days` - 2) ... up to k, while `denominator` will be `total_days` raised to the power of k. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `numerator` remains 1, and `denominator` remains 1.**
