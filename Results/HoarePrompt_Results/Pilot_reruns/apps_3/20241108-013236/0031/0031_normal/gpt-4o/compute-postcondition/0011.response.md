Example Answer:
The value of numerator is updated by multiplying it with `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The variables total_days, i, and MOD are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: MOD is 1000003, numerator is updated based on the value of total_days, denominator is updated based on the value of total_days modulo MOD, i is 1, and k is greater than 0.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, numerator is updated based on the value of total_days, denominator is updated based on the value of total_days modulo MOD, i is 1, and k is greater than 0**
