Example Answer: 
The value of `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`. The value of `p_shared` is calculated based on a formula, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is `p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of k; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of k; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`**
