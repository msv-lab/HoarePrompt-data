Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x. The code then prints the result of the expression ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2). This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description. 

The code works correctly for all potential cases as it follows the problem description and provides the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the correctness of the code is determined as True.
