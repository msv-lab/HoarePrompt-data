Example Answer:
x and y are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. Since the values of x and y are not provided initially, the output state is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
