According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b` have updated values based on the loop's conditions; `i` is incremented by 1.**
