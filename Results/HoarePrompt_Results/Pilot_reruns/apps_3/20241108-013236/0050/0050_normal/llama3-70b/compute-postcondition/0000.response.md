Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts input separated by spaces and `int` converts them to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are now based on the user input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers based on user input. s is a list of n positive integers and b is a list of m positive integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers based on user input. s is a list of n positive integers and b is a list of m positive integers**
