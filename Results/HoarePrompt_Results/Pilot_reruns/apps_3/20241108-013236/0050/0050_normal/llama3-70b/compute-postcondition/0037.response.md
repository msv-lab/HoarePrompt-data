Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b` have updated values based on the loop's conditions; `i` is incremented by 1. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop.***
