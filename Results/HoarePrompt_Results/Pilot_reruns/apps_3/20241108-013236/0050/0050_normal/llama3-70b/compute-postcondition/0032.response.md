Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b` have updated values based on the loop's conditions; `i` is incremented by 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
