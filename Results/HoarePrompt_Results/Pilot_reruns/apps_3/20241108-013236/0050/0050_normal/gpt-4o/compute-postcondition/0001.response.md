Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted into a list of integers stored in variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints**
