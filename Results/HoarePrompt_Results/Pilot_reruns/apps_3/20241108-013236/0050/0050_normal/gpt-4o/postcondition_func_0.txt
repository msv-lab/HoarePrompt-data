The function `func` reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from input, as well as lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, computes the total amount of money remaining after buying shares, and prints this total amount. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but operates based on the input provided.
