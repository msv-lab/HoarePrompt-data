Example Answer:
The list `b` is populated by converting the input values to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**
