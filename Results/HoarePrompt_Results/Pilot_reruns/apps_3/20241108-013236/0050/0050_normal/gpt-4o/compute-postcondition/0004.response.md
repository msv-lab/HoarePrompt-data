Example Answer:
The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value in the list `b`. The list `b` is obtained from input, and `min_buy_price` is not explicitly used in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`**
