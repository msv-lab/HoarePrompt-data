Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input by spaces. The input is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
