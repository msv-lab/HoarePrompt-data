Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, and `b` is a list of integers created from user input split.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, and `b` is a list of integers created from user input split**
