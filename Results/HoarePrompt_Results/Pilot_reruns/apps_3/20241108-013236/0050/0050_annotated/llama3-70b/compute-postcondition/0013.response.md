Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by taking the modulus of `r` and `s[i]`. The previous values of `r` and `s[i]` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than the current value, `m`, `r` is updated according to the calculation, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than the current value, `m`, `r` is updated according to the calculation, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged**
