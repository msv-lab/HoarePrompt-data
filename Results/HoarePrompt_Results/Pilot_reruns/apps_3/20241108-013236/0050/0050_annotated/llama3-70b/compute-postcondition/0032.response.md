Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` have user-assigned values, `r` is either greater than or equal to any element in `s` or less than any element in `s`, `shares` is updated accordingly, `i` is incremented by 1. If shares > 0, `r` is updated based on the calculation, `shares` is set to 0. If shares <= 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Ensure all variables retain their initial user-assigned values and relationships, with `shares` being 0 after the execution of the fragment.***
