Example Answer:
The code concatenates the string representation of the tens place and the ones place of the input integer `s`. The variable `s` has a value between 0 and 99, so the output will be the concatenation of the corresponding strings from the `tens` and `ones` lists based on the value of `s`. If the ones place is 0, it does not add a hyphen. 
Output State: **`s` is an input integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety.**
