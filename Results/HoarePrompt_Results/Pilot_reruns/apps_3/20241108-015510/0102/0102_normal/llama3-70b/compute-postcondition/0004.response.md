Example Answer:
The code prints the string at index `s` from the `ones` list. The value of `s` is given to be an input integer between 0 and 99. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety.
Output State: **`s` is an input integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety**
