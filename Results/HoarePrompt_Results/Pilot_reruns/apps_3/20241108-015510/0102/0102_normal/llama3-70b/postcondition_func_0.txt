The function `func` takes user input `s` which should be an integer between 0 and 99. It then prints out the corresponding word representation of the number input based on whether it falls in the range of single digits, teens (10-19), or multiples of ten. The function handles boundary cases effectively. The function does not explicitly return any value.
