Postcondition: ***`ones`, `teens`, `tens` contain words representing numbers from zero to nine, eleven to nineteen, and tens from zero to nine respectively. If n is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representation of the tens place of n. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the word representation of the tens place of n, a hyphen, and the word representation of the ones place of n. This covers all possible cases for converting the given number n to its word representation.***
