Postcondition: ***`ones`, `teens`, `tens` contain words representing numbers from zero to nine, eleven to nineteen, and tens from zero to nine respectively. If 10 <= n <= 99, the function returns the word representation of the tens place of n if n is divisible by 10. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the word representation of the tens place of n, a hyphen, and the word representation of the ones place of n. This covers all possible cases for converting the given number n to its word representation, ensuring the correct representation for all two-digit numbers between 10 and 99 inclusively.***
