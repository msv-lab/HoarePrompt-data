Example Answer:
The function returns the value at the index `n // 10` from the list `tens`. The value of `n` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value returned. Therefore, the output state is: `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` contains words representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` contains strings representing tens from zero to nine.
Output State: **`ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` contains words representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` contains strings representing tens from zero to nine**
