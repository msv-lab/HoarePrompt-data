Postcondition: ***`ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` contains words representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` contains strings representing tens from zero to nine. If 0 <= n <= 9, the function returns the word representation of the number n from `ones`. If 11 <= n <= 19, the function returns the word equivalent of n - 10 from `teens`. If 10 <= n <= 99, and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representation of the tens place of n from `tens`. If 10 <= n <= 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the word representation of the tens place of n, a hyphen, and the word representation of the ones place of n. This postcondition covers all possible cases for converting the given number n to its word representation, including edge cases at the boundaries (0, 9, 11, 19, 20, 99) and ensuring the correct representation for all two-digit numbers between 10 and 99 inclusively.***
