The function `func` reads an integer `s` as input and prints the corresponding English word representation of that number. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word for that number from 0 to 9. If `s` is between 10 and 19 inclusive, it prints the word for that number from 10 to 19. For values of `s` greater than or equal to 20, it prints the word representation for the tens and ones place. The function handles all cases within the range 0 to 99, ensuring the correct word representation is displayed for each scenario. The function does not explicitly return any value.
