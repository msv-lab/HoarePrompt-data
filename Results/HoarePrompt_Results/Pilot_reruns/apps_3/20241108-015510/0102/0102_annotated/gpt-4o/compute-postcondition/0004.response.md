Example Answer:
The function returns the value at index `n - 10` in the list `teens`. The value of `n` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value that will be returned. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99**
