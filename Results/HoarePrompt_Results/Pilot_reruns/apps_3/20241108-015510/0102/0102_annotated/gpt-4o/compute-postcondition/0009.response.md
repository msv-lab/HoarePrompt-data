Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99. If 11 <= s <= 19, the function returns the element at index s - 10 in the list `teens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 == 0, the function returns the element at index s // 10 in the list `tens`. If 10 <= s <= 99 and s % 10 != 0, the function returns the concatenation of the elements at indices s // 10 in `tens` and s % 10 in `ones` separated by a hyphen. For all other cases where s is outside the range of 10 <= s <= 99 or s % 10 != 0, the function does not return anything.***
