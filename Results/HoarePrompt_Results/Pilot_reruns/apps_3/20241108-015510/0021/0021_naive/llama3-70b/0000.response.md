Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing exactly one swap. It finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, calculates the maximum and minimum possible distances, and then returns the maximum of the two. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
