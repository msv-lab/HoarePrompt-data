Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance between these two elements after exactly one swap by considering all possible scenarios. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for all test cases.
