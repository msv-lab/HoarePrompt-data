Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n` in the list, or the distance from the beginning or end of the list, and the minimum distance between the indices of 1 and `n`. Finally, it prints the maximum of these calculated distances or the distance from `n` to 1 in the list. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it performs these calculations based on the input parameters `n` and `a`. **
