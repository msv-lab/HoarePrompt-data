Example Answer:
`min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n` minus 2. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, so `n - 2` will always be positive. The previous values of `pos1` and `posn` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` stores the index of n in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance calculated based on the positions of 1 and n in the list or the distance from the beginning or end of the list, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated based on the positions of 1 and n in the list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` stores the index of n in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance calculated based on the positions of 1 and n in the list or the distance from the beginning or end of the list, `min_dist` is the minimum distance calculated based on the positions of 1 and n in the list.**
