Example Answer: 
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the integer 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of 1 in the list `a` will be 0. Therefore, after execution, the value of `min_pos` will be 0.
Output State: **`a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0**
