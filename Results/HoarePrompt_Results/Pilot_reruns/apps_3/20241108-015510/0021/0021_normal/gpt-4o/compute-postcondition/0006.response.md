Example Answer: 
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, which is currently 0. Therefore, `dist3` is 0. The values of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1; `dist2` is 0; `dist3` is 0**
