Example Answer:
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`. The value of `min_pos` is 0, and the value of `n - 1` is `n - 1`, so `dist4` is assigned the value `n - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1; `dist2` is 0; `dist3` is 0; `dist4` is n - 1
Output State: **`a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is n-1; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1; `dist2` is 0; `dist3` is 0; `dist4` is n - 1**
