Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`. The values of `n`, `max_pos` are given, and they are used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, dist2 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, dist2 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos**
