Example Answer:
max_pos is assigned the index of n in list a. The value of n is the largest integer in list a, so max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a**
