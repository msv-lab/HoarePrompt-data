Example Answer: 
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`. The value of `max_pos` is the index of the largest integer in list `a`, but the initial state of `max_pos` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list `a`, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list `a`, and `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos**
