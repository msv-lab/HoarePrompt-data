Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100 as per the precondition. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (1 <= a_i <= n)**.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (1 <= a_i <= n)**
