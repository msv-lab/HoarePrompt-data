Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the `index()` method. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of distinct integers between 1 and `n`, and `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`. Therefore, `posn` will be the index of `n` in list `a`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a**
