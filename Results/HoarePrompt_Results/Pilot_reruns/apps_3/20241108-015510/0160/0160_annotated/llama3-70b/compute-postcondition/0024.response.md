Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the current `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`. The previous state of `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of elements in list `A`, `K` is based on user input, `A` is a list of integers based on user input, `max_divisor` is updated to a new value.
Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of elements in list `A`, `K` is based on user input, `A` is a list of integers based on user input, `max_divisor` is updated to a new value**
