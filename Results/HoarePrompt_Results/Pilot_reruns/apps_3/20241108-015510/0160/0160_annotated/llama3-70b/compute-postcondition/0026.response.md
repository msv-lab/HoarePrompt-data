Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of elements in list `A`, `K` is based on user input, `A` is a list of integers based on user input. If gcd % i is equal to 0, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`. If i * i is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum value between its current value and `gcd` divided by `i`, `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.***
