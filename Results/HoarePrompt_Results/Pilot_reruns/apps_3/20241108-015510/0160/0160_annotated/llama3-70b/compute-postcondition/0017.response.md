According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` is greater than 1, so the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is at least 2, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of elements in list A, K is based on user input, A is a list of integers based on user input, max_divisor is assigned the value of the maximum between max_divisor and gcd // i, i is 1, and int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1 is greater than 1**
