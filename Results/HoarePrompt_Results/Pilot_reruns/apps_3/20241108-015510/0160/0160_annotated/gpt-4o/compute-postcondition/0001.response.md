According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range specified by `i` from 1 to the square root of x (inclusive of the square root of x) has at least one element. So, for the loop to execute, `int(math.sqrt(x))` must be greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `divisors` being an empty set does not directly affect the loop execution, but to ensure the loop executes, we can adjust the state to specify that `x` is a positive integer.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
