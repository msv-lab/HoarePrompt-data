Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of a list of integers, which is essential for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
- Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly calculates the divisors of a given positive integer, which is necessary for determining the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
- The problem description is well understood and implemented in the code through the functions provided. The code should work correctly for all cases as described in the problem statement.
