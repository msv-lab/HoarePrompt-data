The function `func_2` takes an integer parameter `x` and calculates all the divisors of `x`. It then returns these divisors in descending order as a sorted list. The code correctly iterates through the range of divisors and updates the set `divisors` with the appropriate values. However, it does not handle the case where `x` is a negative integer or 0. Additionally, the annotations do not cover the scenario where `x` is 1, which has only one divisor. The function output is a sorted list of divisors in descending order.
