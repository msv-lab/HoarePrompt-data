Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set. If `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is less than the square root of `x`, then if `x` is divisible by `i`, both `i` and `x // i` are added to the `divisors` set. This process covers all possible divisors of `x` within the specified range of `i`.***
