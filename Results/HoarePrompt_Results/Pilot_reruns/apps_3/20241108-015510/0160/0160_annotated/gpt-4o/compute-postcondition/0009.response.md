According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer greater than the previous `i` value. 
State: **`divisors` is a set, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is less than the square root of `x`**.
