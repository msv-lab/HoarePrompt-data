Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, then iterates through the divisors of the gcd to find the maximum divisor that satisfies the conditions. The logic in the program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases.
