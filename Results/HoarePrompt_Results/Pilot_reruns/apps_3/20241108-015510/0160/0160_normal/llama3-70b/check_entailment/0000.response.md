Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers N and K, followed by a list of integers A, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A and finds the maximum divisor of gcd, which is in line with the problem requirements.
- The code then prints the maximum divisor of gcd as the output, which is exactly what is expected.
- The code covers all possible cases and edge scenarios to ensure the correctness of the output.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality and do not suggest any discrepancies.
