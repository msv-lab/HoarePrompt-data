Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N. After the execution of the program fragment, `divisors` contains the newly added integer `x // i` if x % i == 0, where i is the divisor of x, which is a perfect square. There exists at least one more perfect square divisor for x that has not been covered in the previous iteration.***
