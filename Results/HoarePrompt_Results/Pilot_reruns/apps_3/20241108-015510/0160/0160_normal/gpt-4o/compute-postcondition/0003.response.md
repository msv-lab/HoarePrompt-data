Example Answer:
The code adds the value of `x` divided by `i` to the set `divisors`. The value of `x` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, and `divisors` includes the divisors of x which is a perfect square.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, and `divisors` includes the divisors of x which is a perfect square**
