The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. The `gcd_result` is updated based on the calculation with each element in the list starting from the second element. If the list has only one element, the function returns that element as the GCD. If the list is empty, the function returns None as there are no elements to calculate the GCD from.
