The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the value of 2 to the power of n minus 1, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function also calculates and returns the value of k factorial, where k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return 2^n - 1 and k factorial.
