Example Answer: 
`n` is increased by 1, and the initial state mentions that `n` is increased by 6, so after execution, `n` is increased by a total of 7. The value of `k` remains the same. The value of `x` is adjusted to meet the condition `n % x != 0`, but the initial value of `x` is not provided, so the exact value of `x` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is increased by 7, `k` remains the same, and `x` is adjusted to meet the condition `n % x != 0`.
Output State: **`n` is increased by 7, `k` remains the same, and `x` is adjusted to meet the condition `n % x != 0`**
