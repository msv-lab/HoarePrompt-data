The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the result of the expression (2^k) * n. The parameters n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the result of the expression (2^k) * n and return it.
