Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated as the difference between `s_i` and `t`. The values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.
Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
