Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `chosen_route` remain unchanged. `i` is 1, `s_i` is the source of the 1st bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the 1st bus route. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`.**
