According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the initial state should be modified as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
