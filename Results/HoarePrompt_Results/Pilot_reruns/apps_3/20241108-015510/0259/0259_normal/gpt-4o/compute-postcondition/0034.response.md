Example Answer:
If `n` is positive, the function returns the value of `chosen_route`, which is the route index with the minimum waiting time. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute. If `n` is positive, `min_wait_time` will be the minimum waiting time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` will be the route index with the minimum waiting time, and the function returns `chosen_route`.
Output State: **If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute. If `n` is positive, `min_wait_time` will be the minimum waiting time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` will be the route index with the minimum waiting time, and the function returns `chosen_route`**
