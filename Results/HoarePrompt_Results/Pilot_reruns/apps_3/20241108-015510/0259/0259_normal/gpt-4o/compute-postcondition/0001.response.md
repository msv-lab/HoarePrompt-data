Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value -1. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, bus_routes is a list of tuples, and min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, chosen_route is -1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, chosen_route is -1**
