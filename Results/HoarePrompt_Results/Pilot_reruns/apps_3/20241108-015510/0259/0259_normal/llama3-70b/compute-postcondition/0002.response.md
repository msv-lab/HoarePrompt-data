According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `buses` is an empty list, which indicates that the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, and `buses` is an empty list.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, `buses` is an empty list**
