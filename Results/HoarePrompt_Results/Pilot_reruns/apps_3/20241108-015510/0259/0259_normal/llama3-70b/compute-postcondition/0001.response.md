Example Answer:
`buses` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `n` and `t` are assigned values based on user input, but the specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are assigned values based on user input; `buses` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned values based on user input; `buses` is an empty list**
