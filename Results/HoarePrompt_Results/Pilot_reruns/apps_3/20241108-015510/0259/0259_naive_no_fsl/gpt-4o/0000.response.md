Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given conditions and selects the route with the minimum wait time, which is the correct approach as per the problem description.
3. The program then prints the chosen bus route correctly.

Overall, the code logic aligns with the problem description and seems to handle all potential cases as described.
