Output State: **`buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `min_time` is the minimum value between the current `min_time` and the result of the calculation `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is the index of the bus (`i + 1`) that has the minimum time, `i` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is updated to the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, Time is recalculated as `(t - s) % d` after the execution of the if else block. If `buses` is an empty list, `min_time` remains positive infinity, `ans` remains -1.**
