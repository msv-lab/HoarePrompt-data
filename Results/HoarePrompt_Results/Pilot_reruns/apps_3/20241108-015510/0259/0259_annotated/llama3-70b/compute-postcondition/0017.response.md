Example Answer:
`min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, where `time` is the result of the calculation `(t - s) % d`. The initial values of the variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `min_time` is the result of the calculation `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in buses, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in buses.
Output State: **`buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `min_time` is the result of the calculation `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in buses, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in buses**
