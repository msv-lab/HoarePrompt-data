According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, the `buses` list is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to have a length of `n`. Additionally, since `_` is the loop variable and its value is not used within the loop body, no adjustment is needed for it. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to: 
State: **`n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n`**
