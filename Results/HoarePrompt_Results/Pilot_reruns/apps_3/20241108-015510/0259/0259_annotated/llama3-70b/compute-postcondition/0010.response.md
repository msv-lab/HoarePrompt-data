Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The length of the list `buses` increases by 1. The values of `s` and `d` are obtained by splitting the input, which are then stored in the tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n+1` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+5`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `s` and `d` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`n+1` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+5`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `s` and `d` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input**
