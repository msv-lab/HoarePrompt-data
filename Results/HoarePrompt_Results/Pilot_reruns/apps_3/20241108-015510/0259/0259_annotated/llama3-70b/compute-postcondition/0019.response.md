Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list with at least 1 element. `min_time` is the minimum value between the current `min_time` and the result of the calculation `(t - s) % d`. `ans` is the index of the bus (`i + 1`) that has the minimum time. `i` remains unchanged. `s` and `d` are updated to the first and second elements of the first tuple in `buses`, respectively. Time is recalculated as `(t - s) % d` after the execution of the if else block.***
