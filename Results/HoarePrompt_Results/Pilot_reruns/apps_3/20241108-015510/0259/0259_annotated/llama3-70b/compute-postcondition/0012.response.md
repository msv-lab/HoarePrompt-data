Output State: 
The loop reads input pairs of integers (s, d) and appends them to the list buses. After the loop executes, buses will contain n tuples of integers (s, d) where n is within the specified range. If n is 0, the loop will not execute and buses will remain an empty list. `s` and `d` will contain the last input integers.
