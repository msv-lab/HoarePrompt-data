Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes the input of the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. It then reads the arrival time and interval between buses for each route. The code calculates the time Serval needs to wait for each bus route and selects the route with the minimum wait time. The output is the index of the selected bus route. The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it correctly determines the bus route that Serval will use based on the provided input. The code logic aligns with the problem requirements, and the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly.
