Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The list `buses` now contains an additional tuple. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+1`, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+1`, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer**
