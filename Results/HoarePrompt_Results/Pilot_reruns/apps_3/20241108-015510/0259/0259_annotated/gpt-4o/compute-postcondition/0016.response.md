Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are derived from the tuples in `bus_routes`. The `wait_time` is then calculated using the formula provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`**
