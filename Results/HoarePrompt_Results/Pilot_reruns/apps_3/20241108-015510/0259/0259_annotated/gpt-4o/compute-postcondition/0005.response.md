Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route, wait_time is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route, wait_time is 0**
