Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples. min_wait_time, chosen_route, i, s_i, and d_i are appropriately updated based on the values in the bus_routes list for the next iteration of the loop. If s_i is greater than or equal to t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i is equal to 0, wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i. In the if-else block, if wait_time is less than min_wait_time, min_wait_time is updated to wait_time, and chosen_route is set to i + 1. This covers all possible scenarios for wait_time comparisons, ensuring proper computation and assignment of variables based on the given conditions, including edge cases where the values of s_i, t, and d_i result in different outcomes for wait_time.***
