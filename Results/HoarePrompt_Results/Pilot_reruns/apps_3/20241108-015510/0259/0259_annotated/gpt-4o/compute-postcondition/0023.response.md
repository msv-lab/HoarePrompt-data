Example Answer:
s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the tuple at index i in the bus_routes list. The values of s_i and d_i are dependent on the specific tuple at index i in the list, so the output state is: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, wait_time, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i are appropriately updated based on the values in the bus_routes list for the next iteration of the loop, s_i and d_i are updated based on the tuple at index i in bus_routes.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, wait_time, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i are appropriately updated based on the values in the bus_routes list for the next iteration of the loop, s_i and d_i are updated based on the tuple at index i in bus_routes**
