Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` are appropriately updated based on the values in the `bus_routes` list for the next iteration of the loop, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.**
