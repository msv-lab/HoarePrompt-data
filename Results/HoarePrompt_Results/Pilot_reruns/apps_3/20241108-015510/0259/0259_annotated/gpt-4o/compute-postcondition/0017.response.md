Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This logic ensures that `wait_time` is appropriately calculated based on the conditions of the if else block, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
