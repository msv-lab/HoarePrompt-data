Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` represents the index of a bus route. Since `chosen_route` is based on the index `i`, it will be incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time based on the conditions, `chosen_route` is the index `i + 1`.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time based on the conditions, `chosen_route` is the index `i + 1`**
