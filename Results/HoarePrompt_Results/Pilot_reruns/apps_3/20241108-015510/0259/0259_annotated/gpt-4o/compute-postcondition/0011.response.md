Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time based on the conditions, `chosen_route` is the index `i + 1`. If the wait_time is less than min_wait_time, then min_wait_time is updated to the wait_time value, and chosen_route is updated to i + 1. This postcondition ensures that the program correctly updates min_wait_time and chosen_route based on the comparison with wait_time.***
