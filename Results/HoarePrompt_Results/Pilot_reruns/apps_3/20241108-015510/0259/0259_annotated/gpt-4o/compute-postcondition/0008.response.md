Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a specific value, chosen_route is a valid route number, s_i is the source of the chosen route, d_i is the destination of the chosen route, and wait_time is the calculated wait time based on the values of t and s_i. If s_i is greater than or equal to t, then the wait_time is equal to s_i minus t. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, the wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, the wait_time is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i. This comprehensive postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the accurate determination of wait_time based on the given conditions.***
