Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. The variables `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are appropriately assigned values based on the tuple elements in `bus_routes`. The calculation of `wait_time` considers scenarios where `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, setting `wait_time` as `s_i - t`. Additionally, if `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. For other cases, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring accurate determination of the wait time for the chosen route while handling all possible edge cases.***
