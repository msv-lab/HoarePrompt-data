Example Answer:
The code calculates n - n % 10, which essentially removes the last digit from the number n. For example, if n is 456, the result would be 450. Since n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the output will always be a multiple of 10 with the same digit in the hundreds place. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the last digit has been removed.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the last digit has been removed**
