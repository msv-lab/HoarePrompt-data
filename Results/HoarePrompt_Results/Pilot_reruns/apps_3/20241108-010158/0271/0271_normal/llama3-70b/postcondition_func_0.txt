The function `func` reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` with its last digit removed. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it prints the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`.
