Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`.
- If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` with its last digit removed.
- If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it prints the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`.

The code follows the problem description for all cases provided in the examples, and the logic implemented in the code matches the requirements mentioned in the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code and do not provide any conflicting information. Therefore, we can conclude that the code is correct.
