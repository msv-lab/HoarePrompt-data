Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9, the value of `result` will always be a non-negative integer. The output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9, `result` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ remainder ≤ 9, `result` is a non-negative integer**
