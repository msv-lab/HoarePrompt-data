Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly checks if the given number n ends with 0. If it does, it prints the number n as it is already rounded. If n does not end with 0, it then calculates the nearest number that ends with 0 by either subtracting the remainder from n or adding the difference of 10 and the remainder to n. This covers all possible cases as mentioned in the problem description.
