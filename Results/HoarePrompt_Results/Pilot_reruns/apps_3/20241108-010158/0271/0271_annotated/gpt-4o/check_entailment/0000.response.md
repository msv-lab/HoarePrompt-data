Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the remainder of the input number `n` when divided by 10, and then rounds `n` to the nearest integer ending with 0 by either subtracting the remainder from `n` if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, or by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n` if the remainder is greater than 5. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
