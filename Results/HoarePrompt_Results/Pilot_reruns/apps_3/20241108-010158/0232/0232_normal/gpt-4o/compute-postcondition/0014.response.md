Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts matching the counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If there is at least one color count in `current_counts` that is less than the desired count, the loop will continue updating the counts until all colors match the desired counts. If the loop ends due to some color not meeting the desired count, the program state remains unchanged with the last updated values of `colors`, `k`, `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, and `right`.**
