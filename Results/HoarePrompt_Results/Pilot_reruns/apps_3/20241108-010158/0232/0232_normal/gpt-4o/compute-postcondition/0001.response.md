Example Answer:
No variables are affected by this line of code. The `current_counts` dictionary is initialized as an empty defaultdict with default value 0. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers of subsequent Jedi Knights, `k` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0**
