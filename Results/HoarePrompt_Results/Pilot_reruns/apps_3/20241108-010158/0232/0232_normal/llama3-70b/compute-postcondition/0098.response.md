Example Answer: 
`color` is assigned the value `colors[j]`. The value of `j` is unknown, so the specific color cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is a boolean, `window_counts` is updated, `i` is the starting index, `n` is greater than `i + 2, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`.
Output State: **`found` is a boolean, `window_counts` is updated, `i` is the starting index, `n` is greater than `i + 2, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`**
