Output State: **`found` is a boolean variable that becomes True if all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts` after sorting. `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of each color, where the color key is updated with the incremented count or initialized to 0 if not present. `color` is the current color value from `colors[j]`. `i` is the starting index, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 3. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color` is the last color in the list, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1.**
