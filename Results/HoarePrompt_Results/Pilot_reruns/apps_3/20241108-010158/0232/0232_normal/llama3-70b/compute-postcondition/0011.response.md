Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` is not already in `color_counts`, it is updated with the value of 0 for that color. If `color` is already in `color_counts`, its value is incremented by 1. The previous values of the variables are `colors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `color` is the second color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `color` is the second color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `color` is the second color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is updated accordingly**
