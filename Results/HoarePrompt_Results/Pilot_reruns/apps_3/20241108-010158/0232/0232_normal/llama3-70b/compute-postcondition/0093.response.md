Output State: **`found` is a boolean, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as the key, and its value is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `color` is the new color value from `colors[j]`, `i` is the starting index, and `n` is greater than `i + 1. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, its value is set to 1.**
