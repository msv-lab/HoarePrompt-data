Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, a list of `n` colors, and a list of `m` counts. It then checks if the counts list represents a valid distribution of lightsabers among Jedi Knights based on the colors list. The function prints 'YES' if the counts list is valid and 'NO' otherwise. The counts list is considered valid if the sum of counts is between 1 and `n`, inclusively. **
