Output State: **`colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `color` is the color at index `j+1` in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, `found` is True, n is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and the count of that color incremented by 1. If the color is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include the color with a count of 1. If all counts of colors in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.**
