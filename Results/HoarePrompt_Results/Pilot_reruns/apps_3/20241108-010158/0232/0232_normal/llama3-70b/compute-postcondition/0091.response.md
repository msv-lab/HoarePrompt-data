Example Answer:
The value of `color` is the new color value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0. This will reset the count of the color in the dictionary to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is a boolean, `window_counts` remains the dictionary with `color` as the key and the value incremented by 1, `color` is the new color value from `colors[j]`, `i` is the starting index, and `n` is greater than `i + 1.
Output State: **`found` is a boolean, `window_counts` remains the dictionary with `color` as the key and the value incremented by 1, `color` is the new color value from `colors[j]`, `i` is the starting index, and `n` is greater than `i + 1**
