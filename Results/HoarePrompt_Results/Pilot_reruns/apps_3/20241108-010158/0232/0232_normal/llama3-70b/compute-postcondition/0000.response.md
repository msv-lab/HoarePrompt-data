Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values of integers separated by a space from the input. The values of `n` and `m` are unknown until the input is received. Therefore, the Output State is: colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 <= sum(counts) <= n; n and m are input integers.
Output State: **colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 <= sum(counts) <= n; n and m are input integers**
