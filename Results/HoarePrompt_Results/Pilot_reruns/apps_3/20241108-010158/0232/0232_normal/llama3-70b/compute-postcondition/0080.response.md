Example Answer:
`window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: If `found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color` is the last color in the list, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1.
Output State: **If `found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color` is the last color in the list, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1**
