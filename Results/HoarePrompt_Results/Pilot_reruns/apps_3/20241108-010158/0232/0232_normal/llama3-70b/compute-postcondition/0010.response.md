Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `color` is the second color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the second color in the list is not already in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` is updated with the value of 0 for that color. Otherwise, no changes are made to `color_counts`.***
