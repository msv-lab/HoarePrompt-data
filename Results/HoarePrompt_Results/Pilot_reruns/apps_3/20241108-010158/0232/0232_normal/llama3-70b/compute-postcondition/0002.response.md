Example Answer:
The `counts` list is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces. The `colors` list is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
