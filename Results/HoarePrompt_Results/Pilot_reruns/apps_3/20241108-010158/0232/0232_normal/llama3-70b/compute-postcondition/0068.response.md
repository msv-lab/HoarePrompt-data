Output State: **`found` is a boolean variable that is True if all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding counts in the `counts` list, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and the updated count value for that color, `colors` is a list of `n` integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of `n` Jedi Knights, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, `i` is the index at which the loop stopped + 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1, if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a value of 0, after executing the code snippet, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts` is updated to have `color` as key with a value of 1, if all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding counts in the `counts` list, `found` is set to True, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts` is updated to have `color` as key with a value of 1, the loop or if statement breaks at this point.**
