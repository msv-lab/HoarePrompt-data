Example Answer:
The dictionary `window_counts` is updated with the value 0 for the key `color`, where `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`found` is a boolean, `window_counts` is updated with 0 for the key `color`, `i` is the starting index, `n` is greater than `i + 2, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`**
