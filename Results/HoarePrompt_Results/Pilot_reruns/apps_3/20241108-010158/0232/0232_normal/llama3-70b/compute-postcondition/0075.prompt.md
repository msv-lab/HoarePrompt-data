You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *`found` is a boolean variable that is True if all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding counts in the `counts` list. `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and the updated count value for that color. `colors` is a list of `n` integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of `n` Jedi Knights. `color` is the last color in the list. `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value. `i` is the index at which the loop stopped + 1. `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a value of 0. After executing the code snippet, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. `window_counts` is updated to have `color` as key with a value of 1. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True, `color` is updated in `window_counts` and the loop is terminated. The postcondition covers all the edge cases, ensuring the correct update of variables and the termination of the loop based on the equality of counts.
```
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
