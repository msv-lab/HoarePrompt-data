According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` and `n` are such that `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n` and `j` must be equal to `i`.
State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is not defined, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`**
