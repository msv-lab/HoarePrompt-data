According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `found` being False does not affect the loop execution directly, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0 in order for the loop to execute.
State: **`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
