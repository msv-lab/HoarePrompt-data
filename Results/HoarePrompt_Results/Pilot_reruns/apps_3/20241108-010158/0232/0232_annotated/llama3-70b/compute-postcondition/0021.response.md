According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `n`. Also, since `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` should be equal to `i` and `i` should be less than `n`.
State: **`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
