Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input. The values of `n` and `m` are now determined based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight (1 <= colors[i] <= m), counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color (1 <= sum(counts) <= n).
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight (1 <= colors[i] <= m), counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color (1 <= sum(counts) <= n)**
