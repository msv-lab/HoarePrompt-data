Functionality: **The function `func` reads input representing the number of Jedi Knights, the number of possible lightsaber colors, the colors of lightsabers for each Jedi Knight, and the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. It then distributes the lightsabers to Jedi Knights based on the colors available and the desired counts. The function outputs 'YES' if the distribution can be achieved as desired, otherwise 'NO'.**
