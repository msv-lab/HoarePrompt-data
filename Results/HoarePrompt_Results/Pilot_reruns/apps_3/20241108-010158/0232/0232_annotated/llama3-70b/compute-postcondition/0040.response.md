Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with keys representing colors and values of 1 if the color was not present in `window_counts` before, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. After the execution of the if statement, if the color is not present in `window_counts`, then the value corresponding to that color in `window_counts` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.***
