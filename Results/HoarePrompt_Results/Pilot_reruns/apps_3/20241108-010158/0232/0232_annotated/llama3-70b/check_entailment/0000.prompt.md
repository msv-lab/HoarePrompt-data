You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

Output
YES
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight (1 <= colors[i] <= m), counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color (1 <= sum(counts) <= n)
    colors = list(map(int, input().split()))
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color
    counts = list(map(int, input().split()))
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color
    color_counts = {}
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary
    for color in colors:
        if color not in color_counts:
            color_counts[color] = 0
        
        color_counts[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop updates the count of each specific lightsaber color used by Jedi Knights in the `color_counts` dictionary. If `colors` is an empty list or `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.
    found = False
    #State of the program here: found is False
    for i in range(n):
        window_counts = {}
        
        for j in range(i, n):
            color = colors[j]
            if color not in window_counts:
                window_counts[color] = 0
            window_counts[color] += 1
            if all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.
                values()), counts)):
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If the loop does execute, found is a boolean indicating whether the condition all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts)) is met. If found is true, the loop or the if statement is exited. If found is True, the loop breaks. The window_counts dictionary is empty. If the loop does not execute, window_counts remains an empty dictionary and found is not defined.
    print('YES' if found else 'NO')
    #State of the program here: If the loop executes and the condition is met, found is True and the loop exits. If not, found is not defined. window_counts is an empty dictionary. The output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of found.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for distributing lightsabers to Jedi Knights based on the colors available and the desired counts of each color. The function will return a list of n integers representing the final distribution of lightsabers among the Jedi Knights, ensuring that each Jedi Knight receives the desired count of lightsabers of each color.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
