Example Answer:
A dictionary `window_counts` is created. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
