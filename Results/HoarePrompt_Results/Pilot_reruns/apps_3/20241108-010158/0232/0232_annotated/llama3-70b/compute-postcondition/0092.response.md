Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` are equal to corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting. `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is set to the new value of `i`. `color` is the value of `colors[j]` before breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
