Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an integer representing the number of possible lightsaber colors, `colors` is a list of at least `n+1` integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, and `color_counts` is a dictionary where the count of the specified `color` is incremented by 1.
