Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly takes the input string and the remembered substring, then iterates through the input string to find the characters that are also present in the remembered substring. It then concatenates these characters with the remembered substring to form the smallest possible integer n. The program handles the given problem description correctly and produces the expected output for the provided examples. Additionally, the program logic is sound and covers all potential cases.
