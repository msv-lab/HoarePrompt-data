Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the smallest possible integer n contains leading zeroes. The problem description explicitly mentions that the decimal representation of number n should contain no leading zeroes, except when n is equal to zero itself. 

In the provided code, there is no logic to handle the case when the smallest possible integer n has leading zeroes. The program should be modified to consider this scenario and ensure that the output meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
