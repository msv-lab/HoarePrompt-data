Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to find all the characters that are present in `t`. It then appends `t` to the end of the new string `n` and returns the integer value of `n`.

The program seems to correctly handle the problem description by reconstructing the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the given inputs. The logic used to iterate through `s` and construct `n` seems to be in line with the problem requirements. 

Additionally, the program handles the input of leading zeroes in the substring `t`, as mentioned in the problem description. Since the logic of the program appears to align with the problem statement and all the examples provided seem to work correctly, the correctness of the program is considered to be True.
