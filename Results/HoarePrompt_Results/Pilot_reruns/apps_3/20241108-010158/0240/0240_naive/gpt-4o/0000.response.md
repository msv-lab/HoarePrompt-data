Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that generates possible numbers by permuting the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring. It then checks if the generated number is valid by ensuring that the remembered substring is present in the number. The program then finds the smallest valid number and returns it. The logic seems correct and handles the problem description as expected. Additionally, the use of Counter to efficiently handle character counting and itertools permutations to generate possible numbers covers all potential cases.
