According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and the validity of the candidate permutation. If `chars` has more permutations available and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` has even more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `sub` must be a substring of `n` that allows `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` to evaluate to true. 
State: **`chars` has even more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a different substring of `n` that satisfies the conditions for `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` to evaluate to true**
