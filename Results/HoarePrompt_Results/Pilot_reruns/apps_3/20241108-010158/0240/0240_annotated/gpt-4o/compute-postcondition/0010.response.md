Example Answer: 
The function yields `candidate`, which is the joined string of `perm`. The values of `chars` and `sub` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `chars` has even more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, and the function yields `candidate`.
Output State: **`chars` has even more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, and the function yields `candidate`**
