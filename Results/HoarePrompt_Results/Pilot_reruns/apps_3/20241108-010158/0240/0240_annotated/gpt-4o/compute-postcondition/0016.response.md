Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`, calculates the difference in character counts between `s` and `sub`, generates a string `remaining_chars` based on the updated character counts, creates a list of possible numbers from `remaining_chars` and `sub`, and then returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. The function does not handle edge cases where `s_counter` might not have enough characters to form `sub`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.**
