Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The values of `chars` and `sub` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` has more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` has more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`**
