Postcondition: ***`chars` has even more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables and no action is taken. Ensure that all edge cases are handled appropriately based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
