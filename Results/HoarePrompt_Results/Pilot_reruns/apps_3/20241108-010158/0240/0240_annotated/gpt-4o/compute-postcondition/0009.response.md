Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The values of `perm` are not provided, so the possible values of `candidate` could be any permutation of characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` has even more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` has even more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`**
