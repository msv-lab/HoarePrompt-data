Example Answer:
The code yields the value of `candidate`, and the initial value of `candidate` is unknown. The state of `chars` and `sub` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n, and the value of `candidate` is unknown.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n, and the value of `candidate` is unknown**
