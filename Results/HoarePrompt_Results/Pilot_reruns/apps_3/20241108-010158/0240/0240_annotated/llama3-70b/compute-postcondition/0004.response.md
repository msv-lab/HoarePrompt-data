Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the first character in `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the characters of `c` and the previous value of `n`. If the first character of `s` is in the set of characters in `t`, then `n` is updated to include the first character of `s`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n`.***
