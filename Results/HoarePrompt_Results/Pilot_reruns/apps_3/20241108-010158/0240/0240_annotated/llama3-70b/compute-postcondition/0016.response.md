Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two string parameters, `s` and `t`, where `s` represents a very large integer with at least one character, and `t` is a substring of `s`. It creates a new string `n` by concatenating characters from `s` that are also in `t`. If no characters in `s` are found in `t`, it returns an empty string. However, there is missing functionality in the code where it should handle cases where `s` is empty or `t` is empty. These cases are not explicitly addressed in the annotations. **
