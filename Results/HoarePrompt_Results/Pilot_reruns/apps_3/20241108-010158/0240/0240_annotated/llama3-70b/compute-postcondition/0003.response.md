Example Answer:
The value of `c` is added to the value of `n`. Both `c` and `n` are characters, so they will be concatenated together. Therefore, the new value of `n` will be the concatenation of the characters of `c` and the previous value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the first character in `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the characters of `c` and the previous value of `n`**
