Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `n` is an integer. If the character `c` is present in `t_set`, then `n` is incremented by the value of `c`. Otherwise, no changes are made to any variables.***
