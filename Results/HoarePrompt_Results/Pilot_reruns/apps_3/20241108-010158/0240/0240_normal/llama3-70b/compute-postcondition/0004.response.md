Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is an empty string. If the character `c` is present in the set `t_set`, then `n` is updated by appending `c`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables `s`, `t`, `t_set`, and `n`.***
