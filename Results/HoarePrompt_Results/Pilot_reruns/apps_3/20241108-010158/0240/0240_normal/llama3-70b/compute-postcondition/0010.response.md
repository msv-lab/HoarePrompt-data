Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with remaining characters to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c` if `c` is in `t_set`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` contains the concatenated value of `c`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
