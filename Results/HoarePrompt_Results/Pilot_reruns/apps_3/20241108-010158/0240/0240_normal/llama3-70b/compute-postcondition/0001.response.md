Example Answer:
`n` is assigned an empty string. The variables `s`, `t`, and `t_set` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is an empty string**
