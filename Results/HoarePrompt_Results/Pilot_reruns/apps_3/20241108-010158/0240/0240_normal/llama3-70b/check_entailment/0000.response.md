Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes two inputs: a string `s` received by Kate and a substring `t` that Vasya remembers.
- The function `func_1` creates a set `t_set` containing unique elements from `t`.
- It iterates over each character in `s` and appends the character to `n` if it exists in `t_set`.
- Finally, it appends the entire string `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`.

The code follows the problem description and output hints accurately. It correctly constructs the smallest possible initial integer `n` using the substring `t` that Vasya remembers. The logic of the code aligns with the problem requirements, and there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the description or hints that suggest otherwise. Thus, the code is correct.
