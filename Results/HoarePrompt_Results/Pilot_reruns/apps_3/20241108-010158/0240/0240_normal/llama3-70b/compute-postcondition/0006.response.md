Example Answer:
The value of `c` is added to the end of the string `n`. The previous value of `n` is empty, and the value of `c` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string with remaining characters to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is a string with the value of `c` added to the end.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with remaining characters to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is a string with the value of `c` added to the end**
