The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, both of which are strings. The function checks if `t_set` is empty or if `s` is an empty string. If either condition is met, `n` remains an empty string. If `t_set` is not empty and `s` is a non-empty string, `n` will contain all characters from `s` that are present in `t_set`. The function then returns the integer value of `n`. The parameters `s`, `t`, and `t_set` remain unchanged throughout the function execution.
Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters s and t. If t_set is empty or s is an empty string, n remains an empty string. If t_set is not empty and s is a non-empty string, n contains all characters from s that are present in t_set. The function returns the integer value of n.**
