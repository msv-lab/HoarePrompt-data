According to the code, the loop can execute as long as string `s` has at least 1 character. However, the condition involving the set `t_set` and empty string `n` does not directly impact the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted such that `s` is not an empty string. Since `t` is specified to be a string, its presence is not required for the loop to execute. Thus, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to: 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from `t`, `n` is an empty string**
