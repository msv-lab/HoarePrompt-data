Example Answer: 
The variable `candidate` is assigned the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list using the `join` function. The function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, which means the string created is a valid number. Therefore, the Output State is: `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True.
Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True**
