Functionality: **The function generate_possible_numbers takes two parameters: chars, a string representing a number, and sub, a string representing a substring of chars. It generates permutations of chars, concatenates them into candidate strings, and checks if each candidate is a valid number using the is_valid_number function. If a candidate is valid, it yields the candidate. The function does not have a specific return value, it yields valid candidates.**
