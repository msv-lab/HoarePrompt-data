Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It decrements the count of characters in `s_counter` based on the count of characters in `sub_counter`, creates a string `remaining_chars`, generates a list of possible numbers using `generate_possible_numbers` function, retrieves the smallest number from the list, and returns it as the output. However, the annotations mention a loop that decrements character counts, but this loop is missing in the provided code. It's important to note this missing functionality in the summary.**
