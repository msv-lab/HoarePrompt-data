According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `perm` list and the condition `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluating to True. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` list needs to be adjusted with more elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, `perm` list is adjusted with more elements**
