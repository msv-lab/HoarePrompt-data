Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate` value, which is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list. The previous state of `candidate` and `perm` is unknown, so the output state is: `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list.
Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list**
