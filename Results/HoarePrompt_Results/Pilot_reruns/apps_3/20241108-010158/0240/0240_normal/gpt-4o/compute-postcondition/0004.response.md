According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the result of the `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` function. If the function evaluates to True, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list. To execute the loop one more time, `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` must evaluate to True. 
State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True**
