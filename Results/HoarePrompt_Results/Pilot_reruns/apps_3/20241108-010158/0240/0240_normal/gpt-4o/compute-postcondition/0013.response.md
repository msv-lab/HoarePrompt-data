Output State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, the function yields `candidate`. If `perm` has less elements than the length of `chars`, the loop continues. If `perm` is equal to or greater than the length of `chars`, the loop stops.**
