Postcondition: ***`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True. If the condition is met, the function yields `candidate`, and `perm` list is adjusted with more elements. There are no changes if the condition is not met.***
