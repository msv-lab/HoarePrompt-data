According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to be 3.
State: **s is a string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, n is the length of string s, i is 3**
