Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string `s`, calculates its length `n`, and checks if `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters at symmetric positions within the string. It then prints 'TAK' if `s` is a palindrome, and 'NIE' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and the input string `s` must consist of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**
