Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. This suggests that the program is initially assuming the input string `s` is a palindrome. No other variables are affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`s` is the input string provided, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True**
