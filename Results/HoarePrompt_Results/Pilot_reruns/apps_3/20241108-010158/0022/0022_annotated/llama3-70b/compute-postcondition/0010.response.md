Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string provided, `n` is the length of `s` and at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False based on the comparison of characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1`, where `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken. The program ensures that the palindrome property is checked at index 1 and breaks the loop accordingly, ensuring proper handling of edge cases.***
