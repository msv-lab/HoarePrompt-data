Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2. `n` is the length of string `s` and `i` is less than `n // 2`. If the character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This condition covers all possible cases when comparing characters at symmetric indices in the string `s`.***
