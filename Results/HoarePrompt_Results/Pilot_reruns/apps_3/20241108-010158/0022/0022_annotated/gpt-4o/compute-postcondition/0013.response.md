The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. The function contains two cases:

Case_1: If the length of string `s` is at least 2, the function iterates through the first half of the string comparing characters at symmetric positions. If a pair of characters at indices `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal, the function returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the loop does not execute.

Case_2: If the length of string `s` is at least 2 and the characters at symmetric positions are equal, the function returns True. If the length of the string is less than 2, the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return False if there are non-matching characters at symmetric positions in the string, and return True if all characters at symmetric positions are equal.
