Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input values of x, y, and z. Then, it compares these values to determine the result Nauuo would get. If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, it prints '-'. If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?' to indicate uncertainty. The output hints also agree with the code and describe the same logic that the code is implementing. All examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.
