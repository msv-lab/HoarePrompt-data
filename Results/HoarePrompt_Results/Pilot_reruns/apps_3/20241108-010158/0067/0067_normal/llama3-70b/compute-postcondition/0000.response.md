Example Answer: 
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values based on the input using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100**
