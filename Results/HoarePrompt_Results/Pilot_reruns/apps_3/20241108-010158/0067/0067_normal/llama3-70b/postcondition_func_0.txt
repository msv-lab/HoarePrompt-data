The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the input, and then based on certain conditions, it prints either '+', '-', '0', or '?'. If x is greater than y + z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x equals y and z is 0, it prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, it prints '?'. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?'. The function does not return any value.
