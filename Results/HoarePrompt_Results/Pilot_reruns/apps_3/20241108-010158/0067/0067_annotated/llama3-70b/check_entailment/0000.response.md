Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes in three integers representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or have an unknown vote. It then determines the result based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description, which are if there are more upvotes than downvotes, it prints "+", if there are more downvotes than upvotes, it prints "-", and if the votes are equal, it prints "0". If the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes, it prints "?".

The code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
