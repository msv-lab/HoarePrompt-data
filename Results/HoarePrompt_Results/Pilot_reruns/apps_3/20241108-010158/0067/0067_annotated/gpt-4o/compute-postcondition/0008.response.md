Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'. In either case, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
