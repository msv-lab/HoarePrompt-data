Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the given input values. It then checks the conditions to determine the final result. The logic covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. For example, if the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, it prints '-', if the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it prints '+', and if none of these conditions are met, it prints '?'. The program covers all possible cases and provides the correct output accordingly.
