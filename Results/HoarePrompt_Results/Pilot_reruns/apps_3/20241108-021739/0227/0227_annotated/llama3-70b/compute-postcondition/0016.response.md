The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is designed to generate a new sequence based on a given initial sequence and return the newly generated sequence. The initial sequence is a series of distinct positive integers represented by `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function will generate a new sequence by rearranging the elements of the initial sequence in such a way that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized. The function will then return the newly generated sequence as output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It generates a new sequence by rearranging the elements of the given initial sequence such that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized, and returns the newly generated sequence.**
