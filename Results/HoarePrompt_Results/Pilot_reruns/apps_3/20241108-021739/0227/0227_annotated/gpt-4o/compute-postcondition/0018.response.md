According to the code, the loop can execute again if there exists a next smallest positive integer in list `a` after `x` that needs to be added to the set `assigned`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the next smallest positive integer in list `a` after `x` was added to the set `assigned` and `x` was updated to this new value. If `a[i] - x` is found in the set `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next smallest positive integer after the updated `x` needs to be added to the set `assigned`.

State: **The next smallest positive integer in list `a` after the updated `x` is added to the set `assigned`. The variable `x` is updated to this new value**
