The value of `can_form` is changed to True. If `can_form` was False, then `m` would have been increased by 1, but since `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `i` is 0, `can_form` is True, `assigned` has at least one element**
