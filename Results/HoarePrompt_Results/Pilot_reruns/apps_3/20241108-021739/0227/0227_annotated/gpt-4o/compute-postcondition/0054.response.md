Output State: **`m` is an integer, `a` contains positive integers, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `i` is the index of the last iteration, `assigned` contains more than 1 element, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
