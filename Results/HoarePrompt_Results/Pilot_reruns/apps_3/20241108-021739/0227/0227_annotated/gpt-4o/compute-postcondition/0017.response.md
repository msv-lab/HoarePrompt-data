Postcondition: ***The next smallest positive integer in list `a` after `x` is added to the set `assigned`. The variable `x` is updated to this new value. If `a[i] - x` is found in the set `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, and the loop or if statement is broken. If `a[i] - x` is not present in `assigned`, the state remains unchanged.***
