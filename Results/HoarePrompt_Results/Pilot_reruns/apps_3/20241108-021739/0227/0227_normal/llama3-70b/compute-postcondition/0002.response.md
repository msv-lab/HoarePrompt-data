Example Answer: 
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The order of elements in the list `a` is changed based on their values. The variable `n` is not affected by the sorting operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers**
