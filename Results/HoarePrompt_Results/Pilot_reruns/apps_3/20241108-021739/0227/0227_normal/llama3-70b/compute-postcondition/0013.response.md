According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` remains the same**
