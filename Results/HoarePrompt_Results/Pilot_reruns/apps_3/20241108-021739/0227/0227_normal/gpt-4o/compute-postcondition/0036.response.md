Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest and subsequent positive integers in list `a` with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in the `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True.***
