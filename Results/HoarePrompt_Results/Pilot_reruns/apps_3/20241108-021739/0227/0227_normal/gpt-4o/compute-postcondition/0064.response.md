The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers. If n is greater than 1, the function will increment m by the number of iterations where no pair of elements in `assigned` sums up to any element in `a`. The `assigned` list will contain all elements of `a`. If n is less than or equal to 1, m will remain 1, and the function will return m. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a, and based on the conditions described, calculate the value of m and return it. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. If n is greater than 1, m will be incremented based on certain conditions. If n is less than or equal to 1, m will remain 1, and the function returns m.**
