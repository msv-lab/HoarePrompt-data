Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the next smallest positive integer in list `a`. If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated. This covers the scenario where the condition is met.***
