Example Answer:
The set `assigned` is initialized as an empty set. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is an empty set.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is an empty set**
