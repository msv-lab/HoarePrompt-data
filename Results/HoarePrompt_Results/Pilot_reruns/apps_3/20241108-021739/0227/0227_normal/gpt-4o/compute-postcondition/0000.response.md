Example Answer: 
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since the list `a` contains distinct positive integers, sorting will rearrange the elements in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
