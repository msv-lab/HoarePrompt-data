Example Answer:
The value at index 0 of list `a` is added to the set `assigned`. Since `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, the value added to `assigned` is the smallest positive integer in `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned contains the smallest positive integer in list `a`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned contains the smallest positive integer in list `a`**
