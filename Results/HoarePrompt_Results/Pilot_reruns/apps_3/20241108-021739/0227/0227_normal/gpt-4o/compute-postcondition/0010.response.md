According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `assigned` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the smallest positive integer in list `a`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the smallest positive integer `x` in list `a` should be different from the next element in `assigned`.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the next smallest positive integer in list `a`**
