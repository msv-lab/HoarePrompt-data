Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. It then iterates through the elements of a in ascending order and checks if the difference between the current element and any previously assigned element exists in the assigned set. If the difference is not found, it increments a counter m. The function returns the final value of m, which represents the number of unique elements that could not be formed by summing any pair of elements in the assigned set. If n is less than or equal to 1, m will remain 1.**
