Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads the input values, sorts them in ascending order, and then iterates through the list to check if the next element is exactly double the previous element. If it's not, it increments the variable m, which represents the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. Finally, it prints the value of m if it's less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1.

The logic used in the program is correct and follows the problem description provided. The program handles all potential cases where the sequence of operations can be performed with the minimum number of variables required.
