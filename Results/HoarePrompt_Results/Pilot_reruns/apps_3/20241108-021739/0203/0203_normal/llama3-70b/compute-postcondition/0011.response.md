Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements. If the last character in the list is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `remocrats` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if-else block, either `depublicans` or `remocrats` is increased by 1 based on the last character in the list. In all cases, `n`, `fractions`, `depublicans`, and `remocrats` are integers and have values reflecting the appropriate increments based on the logic of the if-else block.***
