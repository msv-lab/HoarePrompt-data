Example Answer:
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is 0, so after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 1 element, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 1 element, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0**
