Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After each execution of the loop, if the current fraction is 'D', `depublicans` will be incremented by 1; otherwise, `remocrats` will be incremented by 1. The final values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` will reflect the total count of 'D's and 'R's in the `fractions` list. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain 0. In the if part, if `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed; otherwise, 'R' is printed. In the else part, if `n` is greater than 0, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are incremented based on the fractions list. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. The final count of 'D's and 'R's in the fractions list is reflected in `depublicans` and `remocrats`.***
