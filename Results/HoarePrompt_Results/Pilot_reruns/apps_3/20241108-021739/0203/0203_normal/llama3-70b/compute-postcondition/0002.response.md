The variable `depublicans` is assigned the value 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, fractions consists of n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0.
Output State: **n is an input integer, fractions consists of n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0**
