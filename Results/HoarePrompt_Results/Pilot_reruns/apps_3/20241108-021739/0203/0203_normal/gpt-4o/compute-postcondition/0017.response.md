Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If v is 'D', then i is appended to d_queue. If v is 'R', then i is appended to r_queue. After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of all 'D' characters in votes, and r_queue will contain the indices of all 'R' characters in votes. If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue will remain empty.**
