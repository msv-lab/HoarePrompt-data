Example Answer:
The value at the front of the `r_queue` is removed and assigned to `r_index`. The value of `r_index` will depend on the specific values inside `r_queue`, which are not provided. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue and r_queue may have been modified based on the specific scenario, r_index contains the value removed from the front of r_queue**
