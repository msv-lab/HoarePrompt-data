Example Answer: 
The index `i` is appended to the list `r_queue`. The value of `i` represents the index of the last character iterated over + 1. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', v is the last character iterated over, i is the index of the last character iterated over + 1, r_queue contains the appended index `i`.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', v is the last character iterated over, i is the index of the last character iterated over + 1, r_queue contains the appended index `i`**
