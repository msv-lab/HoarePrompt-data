Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. The values of `n` and `votes` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue and r_queue may have been modified based on the specific scenario.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue and r_queue may have been modified based on the specific scenario**
