Example Answer: 
The index `i` is appended to the `r_queue`, updating the state of `r_queue`. Since we are only appending the index `i`, the `r_queue` will now contain the index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue contains 0 if the first character in the string votes is 'D', otherwise it is an empty list, r_queue contains the index `i`, i is the index of the last character iterated over, and v is the last character iterated over.
