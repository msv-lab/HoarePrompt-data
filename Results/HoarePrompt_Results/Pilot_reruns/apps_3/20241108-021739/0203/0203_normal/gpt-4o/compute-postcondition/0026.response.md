Example Answer:
The value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `d_index`, `n`, `d_queue`, or `r_queue`, we cannot determine the exact resulting state. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue may have been modified, r_queue may have been modified, r_index contains the value removed from the front of r_queue.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue may have been modified, r_queue may have been modified, r_index contains the value removed from the front of r_queue**
