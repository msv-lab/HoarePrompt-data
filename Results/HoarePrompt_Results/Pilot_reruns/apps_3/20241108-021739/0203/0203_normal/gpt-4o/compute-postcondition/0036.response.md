Output State: **If both d_queue and r_queue are non-empty, after the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in votes with potential additional indices appended based on the comparison of d_index and r_index. r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in votes with potential additional indices appended based on the comparison of d_index and r_index. If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue will remain empty. If either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty during the loop execution, the loop will terminate.**
