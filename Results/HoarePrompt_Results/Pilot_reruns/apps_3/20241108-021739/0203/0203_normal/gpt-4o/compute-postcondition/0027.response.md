Example Answer:
r_index is appended to r_queue after adding n to it. The value of n can be any integer between 1 and 200,000. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue and r_queue may have been modified based on the specific scenario, r_index contains the value removed from the front of r_queue.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue and r_queue may have been modified based on the specific scenario, r_index contains the value removed from the front of r_queue**
