Example Answer:
`d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `n` and `votes` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes, `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes, `d_queue` is an empty list**
