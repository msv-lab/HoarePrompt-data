You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see examples of the loop executing several times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after the execution of the loop. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` had greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 or lower than one then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`, i equals n
Output State: **`if n is at least 1 then factorial` is the factorial of `n`, n is 0. if i is lower than 1 the loop doesnt execute and factorial is 1**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in thethe end students will be 0. if studenmts is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **`if students is greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to students, students is 0 at the end. if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**

Your Task:

Initial State: n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character. If there are no 'D' votes in the string, then d_queue remains empty. If there are no 'R' votes in the string, then r_queue remains empty. If both 'D' and 'R' votes are present, the indexes of these votes are added to the respective queues based on the condition met during each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
```
while d_queue and r_queue:
    d_index = d_queue.pop(0)
    r_index = r_queue.pop(0)
    if d_index < r_index:
        d_queue.append(d_index + n)
    else:
        r_queue.append(r_index + n)

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character. If there are no 'D' votes in the string, then d_queue remains empty. If there are no 'R' votes in the string, then r_queue remains empty. If both 'D' and 'R' votes are present, the indexes of these votes are added to the respective queues based on the condition met during each iteration of the loop. r_index is the index popped from the r_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, then d_queue is appended with (d_index + n). If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, then r_queue contains the value of r_index + n.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character. If 'D' votes are absent, d_queue remains empty. If 'R' votes are absent, r_queue remains empty. If both 'D' and 'R' votes are present, their indexes are added to the respective queues based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. r_index is the index popped from the r_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, then d_queue is appended with (d_index + n). If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, then r_queue contains the value of r_index + n. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and ensures the correct handling of edge cases.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string representing the votes, r_index is the index popped from r_queue, d_queue is non-empty. If d_index is less than r_index, the value d_index + n is appended to d_queue. If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, the value r_index + n is appended to r_queue. In either case, the overall state of the program ensures that the required values are updated in the respective queues based on the comparison of d_index and r_index.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
