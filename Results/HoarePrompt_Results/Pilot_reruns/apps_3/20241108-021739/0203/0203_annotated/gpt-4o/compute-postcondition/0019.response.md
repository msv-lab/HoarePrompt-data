Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character. If there are no 'D' votes in the string, then d_queue remains empty. If there are no 'R' votes in the string, then r_queue remains empty. If both 'D' and 'R' votes are present, the indexes of these votes are added to the respective queues based on the condition met during each iteration of the loop. r_index is the index popped from the r_queue.**
