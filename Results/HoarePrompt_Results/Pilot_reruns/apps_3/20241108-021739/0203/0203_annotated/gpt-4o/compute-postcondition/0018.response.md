Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`, where `d_queue` is a queue containing the indexes of 'D' votes. The value of `d_index` depends on the previous state of `d_queue`. If `d_queue` is empty, an error will occur. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character. If there are no 'D' votes in the string, then d_queue remains empty. If there are no 'R' votes in the string, then r_queue remains empty. If both 'D' and 'R' votes are present, the indexes of these votes are added to the respective queues based on the condition met during each iteration of the loop.
