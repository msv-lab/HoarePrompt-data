Example Answer:
If the first character in the votes string is not 'D', then the value of i is appended to r_queue. If the first character in the votes string is 'D', then the value of i is appended to d_queue. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 3 characters. If the first character in the votes string is 'D', then d_queue contains index 1 and r_queue remains unchanged. If the first character in the votes string is not 'D', then r_queue contains index 1 and d_queue remains unchanged.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 3 characters. If the first character in the votes string is 'D', then d_queue contains index 1 and r_queue remains unchanged. If the first character in the votes string is not 'D', then r_queue contains index 1 and d_queue remains unchanged.**
