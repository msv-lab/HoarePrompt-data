Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string `votes` representing their political affiliations ('D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats). It then eliminates pairs of employees with different political affiliations by matching the indices of 'D' and 'R' votes. The function prints 'D' if there are remaining depublicans after elimination, otherwise it prints 'R'. The functionality handles cases where there are no 'D' or 'R' votes in the input string and ensures the loop continues until one queue becomes empty. The function returns the remaining fraction of employees after the elimination process.
