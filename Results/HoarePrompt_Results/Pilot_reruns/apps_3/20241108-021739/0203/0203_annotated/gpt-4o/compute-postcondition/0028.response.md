Postcondition: ***n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 1 character. If 'D' votes are absent, d_queue remains empty. If 'R' votes are absent, r_queue remains empty. If both 'D' and 'R' votes are present, their indexes are added to the respective queues based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. r_index is the index popped from the r_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, then d_queue is appended with (d_index + n). If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, then r_queue contains the value of r_index + n. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and ensures the correct handling of edge cases.***
