Example Answer: 
`remocrats` is assigned the value 0. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, but it is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
