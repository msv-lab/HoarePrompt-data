Postcondition: ***Output State: depublicans and remocrats are integers. If the list is empty, both depublicans and remocrats are 0. If the list contains only 'D' fractions, depublicans is the count of 'D' fractions, and remocrats is 0. If the list contains only 'R' fractions, remocrats is the count of 'R' fractions, and depublicans is 0. If the list contains a mix of 'D' and 'R' fractions, depublicans and remocrats are incremented based on the fractions present. After the execution of the if else block, depublicans and remocrats will reflect the counts of 'D' and 'R' fractions respectively, with both variables being integers.***
