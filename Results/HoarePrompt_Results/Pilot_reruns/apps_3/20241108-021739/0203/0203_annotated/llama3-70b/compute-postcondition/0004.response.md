According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop executes. At the start, `n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, so we can assume `fractions` list is not empty. Before the loop starts, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list of fractions must not be empty, and the loop should start with `fraction` as the first fraction in the list, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, fractions is a non-empty list of fractions with `fraction` as the first fraction in the list**
