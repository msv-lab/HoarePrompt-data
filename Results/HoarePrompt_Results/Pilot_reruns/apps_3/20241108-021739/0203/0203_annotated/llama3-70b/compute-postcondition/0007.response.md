Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers. If the first fraction in the list is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1; otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1. The state of the program after the execution of the if-else block depends on the value of the first fraction in the list, either incrementing `depublicans` or `remocrats` accordingly.***
