Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ for each test case.
The program iterates through each test case, calculates the balance of the string $s$, and then checks if the balance is equal to $x$. If it is, it prints $n+1$ as the number of prefixes.
If the balance is not equal to $x$, it checks if there is an infinite number of prefixes by calculating if the difference between $x$ and the balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of 0 and 1 in the string $s$. If it is divisible, it prints -1 indicating an infinite number of prefixes.
Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes required to reach the desired balance $x$ and prints that value.

The logic in the program aligns with the problem description for every potential case, making the program correct.
