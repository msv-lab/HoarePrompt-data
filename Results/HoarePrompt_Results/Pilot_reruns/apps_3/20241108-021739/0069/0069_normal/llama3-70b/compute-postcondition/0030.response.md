Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `x` are positive integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is incremented by 2, `s` is assigned the input string. If `balance` is equal to `x`, then `n` is printed after adding 1 to its value. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. This postcondition accounts for all possible scenarios, including edge cases where the division by zero might occur, ensuring the program's correct execution.***
