Output State: **For each iteration of the loop, the code reads in values for `n`, `x`, and `s` from the input. It then calculates the counts of '0' and '1' in the binary string `s`, stores them in `cnt0` and `cnt1` respectively, and computes the difference as `balance = cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1`. The loop will execute `T` times, and the values of the variables will be updated accordingly in each iteration.**
