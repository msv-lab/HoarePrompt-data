Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s`, `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. The code snippet prints -1 but does not affect the current state of the variables.**
