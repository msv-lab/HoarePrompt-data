Example Answer:
`T` is assigned the value of the first element of `data` converted to an integer. The value of `T` will depend on the input provided in `data[0]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split elements of the input, `T` is an integer based on the first element of `data`.
Output State: **`data` contains the split elements of the input, `T` is an integer based on the first element of `data`**
