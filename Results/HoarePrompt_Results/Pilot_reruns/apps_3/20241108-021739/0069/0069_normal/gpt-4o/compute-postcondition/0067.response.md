Example Answer:
The value of `count` is appended to the `results` list. The value of `count` depends on the conditions met during the loop iteration through `prefix_balances`. If the loop does not execute, the value of `count` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is unchanged, and the `results` list contains the value of `count`.
Output State: **`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is unchanged, the `results` list contains the value of `count`**
