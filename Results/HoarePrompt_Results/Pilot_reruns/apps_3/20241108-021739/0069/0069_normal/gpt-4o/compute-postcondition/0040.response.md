Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **`x` is assigned the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`**
