Example Answer:
A new value of 0 is appended to the results list. The loop calculating the prefix sum of balances based on the binary string 's' is not affected by this append operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop calculates the prefix sum of the balances based on the binary string 's', results list contains a new value of 0.
Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix sum of the balances based on the binary string 's', results list contains a new value of 0**
