According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `prefix_balances[i]` was updated based on certain conditions, while all other variables remained unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `prefix_balances[i]` should be updated based on the condition specified in the loop.
State: **`prefix_balances[i+1]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i] + (1 if s[i] == '0' else -1), while all other variables remain unchanged**
