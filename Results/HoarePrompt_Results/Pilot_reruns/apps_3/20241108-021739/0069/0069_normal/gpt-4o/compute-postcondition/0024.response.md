According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `prefix_balances`. If `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute. Since `count` is 0 before the loop starts, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `prefix_balances` must be a non-empty list.
State: **`count` is 0, `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list**
