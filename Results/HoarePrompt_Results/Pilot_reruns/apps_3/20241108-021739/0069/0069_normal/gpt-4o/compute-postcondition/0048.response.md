According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. 
State: **`x` is assigned the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
