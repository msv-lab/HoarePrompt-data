Example Answer:
After the code is executed, `index` is incremented by 3. The previous values of `x` and `s` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3.
Output State: **`x` is assigned the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3**
