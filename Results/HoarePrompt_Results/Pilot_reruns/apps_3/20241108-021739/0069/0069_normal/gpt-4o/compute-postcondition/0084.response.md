Example Answer:
The list `results` appends the value -1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration of the loop, while all other variables remain unchanged. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances[i]` remains unchanged. `results` appends -1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value after each iteration of the loop, while all other variables remain unchanged. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances[i]` remains unchanged. `results` appends -1**
