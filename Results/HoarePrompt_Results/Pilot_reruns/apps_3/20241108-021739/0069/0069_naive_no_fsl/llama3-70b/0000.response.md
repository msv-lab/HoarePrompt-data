Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the given string and checks if the balance is equal to the desired balance $x$. If it is equal, it prints $n + 1$ as the number of prefixes. If the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the calculated balance is divisible by the difference between the count of 0s and 1s in the string $s$, it prints -1 indicating infinite prefixes. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes required to achieve the desired balance and prints that value. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output.
