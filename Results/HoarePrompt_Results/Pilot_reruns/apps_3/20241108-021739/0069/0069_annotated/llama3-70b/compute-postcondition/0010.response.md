Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. This postcondition ensures that all possible scenarios are covered, including potential zero division errors.***
