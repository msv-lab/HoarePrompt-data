Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer + 1, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, `s` is assigned an input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are updated based on the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1`***
