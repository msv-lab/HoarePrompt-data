Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the condition `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` is true, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. This postcondition covers all possible cases including when the input values lead to a zero division error, ensuring the integrity of the program logic.***
