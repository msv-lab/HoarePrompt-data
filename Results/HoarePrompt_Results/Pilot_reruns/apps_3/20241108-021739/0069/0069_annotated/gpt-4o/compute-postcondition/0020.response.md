Example Answer: 
The `results` list appends the value -1. The loop for calculating the prefix sum of balances may or may not have executed before this line, so the state of the `prefix_balances` list is unknown. The output state will be dependent on the previous state of `prefix_balances` and the appended value of -1.
Output State: **Depends on the previous state of `prefix_balances` and the appended value of -1**
