Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned as `data[index + 2]`. The previous values of `data`, `index`, and `x` are not provided, so the exact value of `s` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will be updated with the new prefix sum; `x` is an integer.
Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will be updated with the new prefix sum; `x` is an integer**
