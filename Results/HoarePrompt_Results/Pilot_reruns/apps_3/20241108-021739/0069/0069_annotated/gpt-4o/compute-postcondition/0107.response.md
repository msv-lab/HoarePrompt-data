According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `results`. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain unchanged and the value of `result` is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least one more element.
State: **All variables remain unchanged, `results` list has at least one more element**
