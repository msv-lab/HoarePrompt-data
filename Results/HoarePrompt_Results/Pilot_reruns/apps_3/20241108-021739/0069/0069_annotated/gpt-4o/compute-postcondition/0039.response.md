Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned to be the integer conversion of `data[index + 1]`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, so the output state is: If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will be updated with the new prefix sum, and `x` is an integer.
Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will be updated with the new prefix sum, `x` is an integer**
