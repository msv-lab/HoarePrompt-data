Example Answer: 
The program reads input from standard input using the `sys.stdin.read` function. Since the values of $T$, $n$, $x$, and $s$ are not directly affected by this code snippet, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **$T$ is a positive integer. For each test case, $n$ is a positive integer, $x$ is an integer such that $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$, and $s$ is a binary string of length $n**.
