Example Answer:
`prefix_balances` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. Since `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, the length of `prefix_balances` is determined by this value. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **$T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list, `balance` is an integer value, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**
