Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x. 

1. The program incorrectly checks if `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list when `balance` is 0. According to the problem description, if the balance is 0, we should output -1 if there is an infinite number of such prefixes, not check if `x` is in `prefix_balances`. This logic is incorrect.

2. Additionally, the program does not handle the case of an infinite number of prefixes correctly. It should output -1 in this case, but the program does not do so.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
