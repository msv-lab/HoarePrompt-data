Output State: **If T is greater than 0, the loop will iterate through the results list and print each element. The variables n, x, s, index, balance, prefix_balances will be updated based on the loop execution. If balance is 0, the loop will check if x is in prefix_balances and append -1 to results if it is, otherwise append 0. If balance is not 0, the loop will count the number of elements in prefix_balances that meet certain conditions and append this count to results. If T is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute and results will remain an empty list.**
