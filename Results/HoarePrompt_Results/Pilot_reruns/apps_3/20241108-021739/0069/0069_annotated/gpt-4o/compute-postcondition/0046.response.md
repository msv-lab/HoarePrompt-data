According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0. Since `index` is 3, `i` in the next iteration should be adjusted to 4 to make the loop execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4**
