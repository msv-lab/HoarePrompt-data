Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 2` of the `data` list. Since `index` is 1, `s` is assigned the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: $T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list.
Output State: **$T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list**
