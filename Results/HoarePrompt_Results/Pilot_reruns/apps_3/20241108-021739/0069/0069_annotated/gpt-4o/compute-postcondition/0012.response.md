According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. 
Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list, `balance` is an integer value, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1 and `i` is 1**
