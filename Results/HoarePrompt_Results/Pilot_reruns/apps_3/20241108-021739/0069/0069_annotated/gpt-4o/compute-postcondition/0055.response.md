Example Answer: 
`count` is assigned the value 0. The loop will not execute as `n` is not provided, so the previous values of other variables are retained. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, and `prefix_balances` will not be updated.
Output State: **`count` is 0, `index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, and `prefix_balances` will not be updated**
