Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the values in the `s` list. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, the results list will have -1 appended. Otherwise, the results list will have 0 appended.***
