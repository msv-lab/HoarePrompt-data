Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of values and `index` is 3. The value of `index` is known to be 3. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value at index 3 of the `data` list converted to an integer. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **If `T` is greater than 1, `index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is the value at index 3 of `data` converted to an integer, and `prefix_balances` is updated.**
