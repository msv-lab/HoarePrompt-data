Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes for `n` times. After the loop executes, `index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, and `prefix_balances` is updated according to the given condition. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `index` remains 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, and `prefix_balances` is not updated. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` list appends -1. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` list appends 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is an integer, `index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, and `results` contains the value of `count`.***
