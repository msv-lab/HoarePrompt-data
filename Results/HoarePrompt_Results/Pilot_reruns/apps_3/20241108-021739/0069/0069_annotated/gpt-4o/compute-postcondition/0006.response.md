Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is 1. If `data` contains at least one element, then `n` will be assigned the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: $T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element, and `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list.
Output State: **$T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list**
