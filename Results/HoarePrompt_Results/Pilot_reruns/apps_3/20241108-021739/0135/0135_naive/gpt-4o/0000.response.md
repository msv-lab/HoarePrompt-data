Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether all the remainders are distinct as required by the problem description. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k and stores the remainders in a set. If it encounters a remainder that is already in the set, it returns 'No'. If it successfully iterates through all integers without encountering a repeated remainder, it returns 'Yes'. The logic in the program follows the problem description accurately, and it covers all potential cases.
