The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of the first n positive integers that are multiples of k, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function returns the sum of these multiples. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the sum of the first n positive integers that are multiples of k.
