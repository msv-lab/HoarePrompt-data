Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The input values could be any integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
