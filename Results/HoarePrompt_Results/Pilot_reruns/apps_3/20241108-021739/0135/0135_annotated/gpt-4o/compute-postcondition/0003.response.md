According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is positive, the loop can execute. Since `seen_remainders` is an empty set before the loop starts, it needs to be adjusted to include `k` as a positive number and `i` to be 1.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 1**
