The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. 

Case 2: If k is a positive number, the function initializes an empty set `seen_remainders`, iterates through values of `i` from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i as `remainder`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the loop stops and returns 'No'. Otherwise, `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders calculated so far. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. 

Case 3: Same as Case 2, but in this case, the function returns 'Yes' after the loop completes without encountering any repeated remainders.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers n and k within the specified range, and based on the conditions described in the cases, return 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
