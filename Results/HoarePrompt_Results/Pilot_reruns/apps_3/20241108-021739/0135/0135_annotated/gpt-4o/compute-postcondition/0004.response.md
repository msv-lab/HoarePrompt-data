Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. The values of `seen_remainders`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 1**
