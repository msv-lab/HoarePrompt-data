Correctness: **True**

I have reviewed the provided code and the problem description, and I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. The code correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description, and the examples provided also output the expected results. Therefore, I believe the code is correct for all potential cases.
