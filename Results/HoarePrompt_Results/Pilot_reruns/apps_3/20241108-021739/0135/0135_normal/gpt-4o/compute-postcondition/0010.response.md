Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, where `n` is greater than `k` and `i` is 3. The possible values for `remainder` are 0, 1, or 2. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, `remainder` is 0, 1, or 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, `remainder` is 0, 1, or 2**
