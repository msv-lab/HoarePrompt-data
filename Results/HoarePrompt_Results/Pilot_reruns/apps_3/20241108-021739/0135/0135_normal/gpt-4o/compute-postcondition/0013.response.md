Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute and the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, after the loop executes, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is either an empty set or contains unique remainders from `n % i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`, `i` is the value the loop ended on, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i` for the last iteration.**
