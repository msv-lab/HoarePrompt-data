According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` need to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than `k` and `k` is at least 1. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1, the state should include `i` is 1 at the beginning of the loop.
State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
