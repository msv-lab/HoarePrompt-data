Example Answer: 
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are input integers. The value of `i` is 1, so `remainder` will be the remainder of `n` divided by 1, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are input integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
