Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the user input after splitting the input. The values of `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and n·m·k. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, `a` and `b` are user-input integers.
Output State: **`n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, `a` and `b` are user-input integers**
