Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `a` and `m` are user-input integers. The value of `a_floor` depends on the inputs `a` and `m`. The output state is: `n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b, a_floor` are user-input integers.
Output State: **`n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b, a_floor` are user-input integers**
