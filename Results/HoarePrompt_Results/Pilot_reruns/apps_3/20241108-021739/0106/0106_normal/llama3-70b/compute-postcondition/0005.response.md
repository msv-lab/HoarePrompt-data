Example Answer:
`b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `b` is a user-input integer. The value of `b_block` depends on the value of `b`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `b_block` is determined by dividing `b - 1` by `(m * k)` and adding 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b, a_floor` are user-input integers, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
Output State: **`n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b, a_floor` are user-input integers, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
