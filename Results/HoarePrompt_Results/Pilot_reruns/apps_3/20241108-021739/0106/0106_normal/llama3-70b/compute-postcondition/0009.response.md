Postcondition: ***`n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b, a_floor` are user-input integers, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated based on the given formula. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
