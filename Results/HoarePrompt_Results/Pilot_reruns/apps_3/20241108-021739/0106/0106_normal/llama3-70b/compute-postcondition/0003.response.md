Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated using the formula provided. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are user-input integers, and `a_floor` is not used in the calculation. The calculation involves division, floor division, and addition. The output state is: `n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b, a_floor` are user-input integers, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`n, m, k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a, b, a_floor` are user-input integers, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula**
