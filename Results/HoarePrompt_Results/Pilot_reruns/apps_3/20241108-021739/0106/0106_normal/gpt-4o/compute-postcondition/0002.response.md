Example Answer:
`floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`, where `//` represents integer division and `k` is a constant value. The calculation is based on the previous value of `floor_within_block` and the constant value of `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `block` is calculated based on the formula, `floor` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`block` is calculated based on the formula, `floor` is updated accordingly**
