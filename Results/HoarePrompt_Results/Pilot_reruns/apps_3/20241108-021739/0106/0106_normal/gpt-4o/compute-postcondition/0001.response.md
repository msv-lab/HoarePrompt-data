`floor_within_block` is calculated using the formula provided, where `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are used in the calculation. The previous values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the Output State is: `block` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`block` is calculated based on the formula**
