According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, so for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1. The state of `n` does not directly affect the loop execution, and `i` will start at 1. Since `seen_remainders` is an empty set, it does not impact the loop execution either.

For the loop to be executed, `k` must be at least 1, and the initial value of `i` is 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
