The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- In Case 2, if `k` is less than 1, there is no execution of further logic, and the function has no return value.
- In Case 3, if `k` is at least 1 and `k` is less than `n`, the function computes all unique remainders of `n` when divided by integers from 1 to `k`, and if any remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the relationship between these integers, it returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, and returns 'Yes' if `k` is less than `n` and unique remainders exist. If `k` is less than 1, there is no return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n` and at least 1, it returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, there is no return value.**
