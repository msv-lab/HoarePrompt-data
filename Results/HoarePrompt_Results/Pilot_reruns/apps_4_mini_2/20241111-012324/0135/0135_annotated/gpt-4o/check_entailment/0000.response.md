To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step, taking into account both the code and its annotations.

### Problem Description Summary:
We need to check if the remainders of `n` when divided by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. If there are any two integers `i` and `j` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`, we should return "No". If all remainders are distinct, we return "Yes".

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**:
   - The code checks if `k >= n`. If true, it returns 'No'. This is a valid check because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `n % k` is likely to repeat with some smaller divisor since the range includes `1` to `n` where at least one of the remainders would be `0`.
   - The annotation states that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function correctly identifies that this results in non-distinct remainders.

2. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The code initializes an empty set `seen_remainders`.
   - It then iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and checks if that remainder is already in the set.
   - If a remainder is found in the set, it returns 'No', indicating that there are non-distinct remainders.
   - If no duplicates are found after checking all integers from `1` to `k`, it returns 'Yes'.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is `1` explicitly, but since `1 ≤ n` and `1 ≤ k`, it will always yield a distinct remainder of `n % 1 = 0`, which is valid for the single case when `k = 1`.
- The loop effectively covers all values of `i` from `1` to `k`. However, we must consider edge cases where `k` is large but still less than `n`, and how that impacts the uniqueness of remainders.

### Example Analysis:
1. **Example Input**: `4 4`
   - Remainders: `4 % 1 = 0`, `4 % 2 = 0`, `4 % 3 = 1`, `4 % 4 = 0`.
   - The output is 'No', which is correct as `0` appears multiple times.

2. **Example Input**: `5 3`
   - Remainders: `5 % 1 = 0`, `5 % 2 = 1`, `5 % 3 = 2`.
   - The output is 'Yes', which is correct as all remainders are distinct.

### Edge Cases:
- If we test with `n = 10` and `k = 5`, we get `10 % i` for `i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, which yields `{0, 0, 1, 2, 0}`. The output would be 'No' due to multiple `0`s.
- If `n = 10` and `k = 10`, the output would also be 'No' since we have various `0`s again.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles edge cases as expected. The annotations align with the behavior of the code, confirming that the function checks for all conditions laid out in the problem description.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
