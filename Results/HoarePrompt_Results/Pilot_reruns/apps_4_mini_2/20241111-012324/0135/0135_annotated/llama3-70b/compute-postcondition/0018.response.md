Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` includes `remainder`, which is either 0 or 1, and `i` is k + 1. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues without any output and does not exit, implying that the program is designed to handle cases where `remainder` could be newly added to `seen` or trigger an exit based on its presence.***
