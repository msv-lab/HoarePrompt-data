The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, and checks the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder has been seen before (i.e., if it is already in the set of seen remainders), it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 1, as the loop would not execute, and it would still print 'Yes' without processing any input.
