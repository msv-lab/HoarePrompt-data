According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k + 1`. The variable `i` will start at 1 and will increment by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `k`. 

Given that `n` is an input integer but not directly relevant to the loop execution, it does not need to be adjusted. The `seen` variable, being a set, is also not relevant for the loop execution at this point, but it will be relevant in the loop body.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` should be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is set(), `i` is 1**
