Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1; `seen` is an empty set; `i` is 1; and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the execution continues beyond this point.***
