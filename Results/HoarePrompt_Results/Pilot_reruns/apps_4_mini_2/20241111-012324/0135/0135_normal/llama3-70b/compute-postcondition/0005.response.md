The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the execution of the program immediately. None of the variables are changed as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, and we mention that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1; `seen` is an empty set; `i` is 1; `remainder` is 0; and 'No' is printed. The program has exited.**
