The function returns the string `'No'`. The values of the other variables do not change as the return statement only affects the output of the function. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function returns 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function returns 'No'**
