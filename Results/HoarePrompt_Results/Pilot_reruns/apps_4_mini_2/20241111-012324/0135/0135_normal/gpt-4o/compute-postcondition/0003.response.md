According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1. The variable `n` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, nor does the `seen_remainders` set. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 1 as the loop begins.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
