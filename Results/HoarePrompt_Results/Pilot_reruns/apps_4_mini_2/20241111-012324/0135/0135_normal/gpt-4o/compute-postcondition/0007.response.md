According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The value of `k` does not need to be changed, as it is already greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, the only adjustments needed are for `i` to be updated to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is 0.**
