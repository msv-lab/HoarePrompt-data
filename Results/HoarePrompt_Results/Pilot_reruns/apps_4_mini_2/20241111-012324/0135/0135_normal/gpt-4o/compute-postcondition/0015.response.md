Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where both must be between 1 and 10^18. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is found more than once, it returns 'No'. If no remainders are repeated during the iterations, it returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the function does not execute the loop and implicitly returns None. **
