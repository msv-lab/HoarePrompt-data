The function returns `'No'`. The values of `n` and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 10^18, but they do not affect the return value. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and the function returns 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and the function returns 'No'**
