To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze both the code and the potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if all remainders of `n` divided by all integers `i` from 1 to `k` are distinct. The conditions specified are:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the answer should be "No".
- If `k` is less than `n`, we need to check the remainders of `n % i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ k` and ensure that all remainders are distinct.

### Code:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'
```

### Output Hints:
The hints state:
- The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- If `k` is less than `n`, it checks for distinct remainders and returns 'No' if any remainder is found more than once, otherwise 'Yes'.
- If `k` is less than 1, the function does not execute the loop and implicitly returns None.

### Analysis:
1. **When `k >= n`:**
   - The function correctly returns "No" based on the condition `if k >= n`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **When `k < n`:**
   - The code initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to track the remainders.
   - It iterates through integers `i` from 1 to `k` and computes `n % i`.
   - If the computed remainder is already in the set, it returns "No", indicating a duplicate.
   - If no duplicates are found, it returns "Yes".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where `k` is less than 1 because the constraints state that `1 ≤ k`. Thus, this case is irrelevant here.
   - However, the program fails to account for scenarios where certain values of `k` can lead to duplicate remainders. For instance, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be:
     - `n % 1 = 0`
     - `n % 2 = 0`
     - `n % 3 = 1`
     - `n % 4 = 2`
     - `n % 5 = 0`
     Here, remainder `0` appears multiple times (for `i = 1`, `i = 2`, and `i = 5`), which should cause the function to return "No". The function does correctly identify this case.

4. **Output Hints Validation:**
   - The output hints correctly describe the function's behavior and agree with the code. They outline the logic of checking duplicates and the conditions for returning "Yes" or "No".

### Conclusion:
Upon examining the code, the problem description, and the output hints, the function accurately fulfills the requirements of the problem description. It correctly handles the scenario where `k` is less than, equal to, or greater than `n`, and it checks for distinct remainders effectively.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
