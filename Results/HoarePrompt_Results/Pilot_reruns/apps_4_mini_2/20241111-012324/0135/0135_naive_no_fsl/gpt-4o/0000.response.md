Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle cases where \( k \) is less than \( n \). Specifically, when \( k \) is 1, the program will incorrectly return "No" since \( n \mod 1 \) is always 0, which means there cannot be distinct remainders when \( k = 1 \) because there is only one remainder.

For example, consider the input:
```
10 1
```
The expected output is "No" since \( 10 \mod 1 = 0 \) and there are no other \( i \) values to compare with. However, the program will return "Yes" because it will not enter the loop (since \( k = 1 \) causes the loop to not execute).

Thus, the logic fails to account for the case where \( k \) is less than or equal to 1, leading to incorrect outputs.
