Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where `k` is larger than `n` correctly. Specifically, the program calculates the remainders for integers from `1` to `k`, but when `i` exceeds `n`, the remainder `n % i` will always equal `n` for all `i > n`. This means that for any `k > n`, the remainders will not be distinct because there will be multiple values of `i` (specifically, all integers from `n + 1` to `k`) that lead to the same remainder of `n`.

For example, if we input `n = 3` and `k = 5`, the program will compute:
- `3 % 1 = 0`
- `3 % 2 = 1`
- `3 % 3 = 0` (this is a duplicate)
- `3 % 4 = 3`
- `3 % 5 = 3`

Here, the program should return "No" because the remainders `0` and `3` are repeated. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where `k > n`, leading to incorrect outputs for such inputs. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
