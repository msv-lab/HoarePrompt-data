The code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `k` using the `map` function, which takes input and splits it into three integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input. Other variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the input values, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
