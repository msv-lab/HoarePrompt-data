The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are positive integers constrained by 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. It also accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine its return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these five parameters with their respective constraints but does not provide information about the output or return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000) and a, b (integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b). The return value is not specified.**
