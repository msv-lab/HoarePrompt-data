The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value of `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The previous values of the variables `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` are needed to compute this value. 

Since `block_b` is derived from the function `get_location(b)`, it is not affected by the current assignment. The value of `abs(block_a - block_b)` is calculated first, then it is subtracted from `n`, and the result is taken modulo `n`. Finally, this result is multiplied by 15 to obtain `reverse_walk_time`.

Therefore, the output state does not change the values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b`, but it does introduce a new variable `reverse_walk_time` based on these.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned from the function `get_location(b)`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`**.
