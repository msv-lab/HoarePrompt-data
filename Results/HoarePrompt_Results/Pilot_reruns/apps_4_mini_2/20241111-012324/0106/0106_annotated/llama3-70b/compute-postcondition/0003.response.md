The variable `a_block` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and they have been assigned from input. The calculation involves integer division and will yield a positive integer value for `a_block`. The previous values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers from input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers from input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
