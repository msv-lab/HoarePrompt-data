The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are positive integers representing dimensions, and distinct integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the time taken to traverse from block and floor positions derived from `a` and `b`, and then prints the total time, which consists of block time and floor time. The function does not accept parameters directly and relies on user input. It handles cases where the inputs are constrained between 1 and 1000 for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and between 1 and `n*m*k` for `a` and `b`.
