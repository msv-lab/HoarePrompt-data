To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the annotations and the code against the problem description carefully.

### Problem Description Summary:

1. **Building Structure**: There are `n` blocks (entrances), each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments. The total apartments are `n * m * k`.
2. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered sequentially starting from 1.
3. **Travel Time**: 
   - Moving between floors takes 5 seconds (by stairs).
   - Moving between adjacent blocks takes 15 seconds (walking outside).
   - Using the elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor.
4. **Edward's Movement**: Edward can choose to go in either direction around the building.

### Code Breakdown:

**Function 1: `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**
- This function calculates the total time for Edward to reach Natasha from apartment `a` to apartment `b`.
- It determines the block and floor of both apartments using `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`.
- Calculates the time to exit based on the floor of apartment `a` (if on the first floor, no time needed).
- Computes time taken for walking between blocks in both directions and considers the minimum.
- Finally, it adds the time taken to reach the target floor.

**Function 2: `get_location(apartment)`**
- This function calculates which block and floor an apartment is located in.
- It correctly calculates the block and floor based on the apartment number.

### Key Observations:

- **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle scenarios where `a` or `b` might exceed the maximum apartment number `n * m * k`. However, the problem guarantees `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k`. Thus, this assumption is safe under the given constraints.
- **Logic for Different Situations**: The code handles the calculation of time based on whether the starting floor is the first floor, which affects how Edward exits. It includes both direct and reverse walking times, picking the minimum, which aligns with the problem description.
- The calculations for each segment (elevator time, walking time, and time to reach the target floor) appear logical and consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code and the annotations:
- The annotations reflect the logic implemented in the code correctly and do not indicate any overlooked edge cases or logical errors.
- The code seems to correctly calculate the total minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha’s apartment for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
