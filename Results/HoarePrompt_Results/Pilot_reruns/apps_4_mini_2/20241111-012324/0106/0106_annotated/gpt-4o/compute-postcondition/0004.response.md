The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The input `apartment` is an integer that represents an apartment number, and it is constrained such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k where n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000). The function calculates values related to the apartment's location in a building structure. It returns two values: `block` and `floor`. Specifically, `block` is determined based on the apartment number, and `floor` represents the floor number within that block. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding `block` and `floor` of the apartment within a structured building system. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the corresponding block and floor of the apartment within a structured building system.**
