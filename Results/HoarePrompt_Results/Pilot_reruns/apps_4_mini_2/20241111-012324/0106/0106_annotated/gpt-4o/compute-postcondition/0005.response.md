Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment`, calculates which block and floor the apartment is located in within a multi-block building structure defined by parameters `m` and `k`. It returns a tuple containing the block number and the floor number corresponding to the given apartment. The function assumes `m` and `k` are positive integers, and there are no checks for the validity of the input `apartment` beyond the implicit assumptions made in the calculations. **
