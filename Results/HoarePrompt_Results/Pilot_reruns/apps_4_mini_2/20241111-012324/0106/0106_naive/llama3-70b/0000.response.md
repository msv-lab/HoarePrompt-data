The provided program is intended to compute the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the input parameters of the building's structure and the apartments' numbering.

Upon analyzing the program, we see the following logic:

1. It correctly calculates the floor and block ( подъезд ) for both Edward's and Natasha's apartments using:
   - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1` for the floor number,
   - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` for the block number.
   
2. The program calculates the minimum time to move between the blocks, taking into account the circular nature of the building:
   - `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

3. The time to move vertically between floors is calculated, but there is a flaw in the logic:
   - It assumes that if `a_floor > b_floor`, the time spent in the lift is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. This does not account for the situation where Edward is already on the same floor or below Natasha's floor and uses the lift.

4. If Edward is already on the same floor as Natasha, the program still adds the lift waiting time of 10 seconds and the time to move, which is not correct as he can simply walk without needing to call the lift.

5. Furthermore, there is an issue with the calculation of `a_block` and `b_block`, where the formula for blocks should be based on the total number of apartments per block rather than the total number of floors and apartments.

As a result of these points, the program does not correctly cover all potential cases, particularly when Edward and Natasha are on the same floor or when the logic for blocks is miscalculated.

Thus, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails particularly in cases where Edward and Natasha are on the same floor, as it incorrectly includes lift waiting time when it should not. For example, if Edward is in apartment 5 (1st floor, 1st block) and Natasha is in apartment 2 (1st floor, 1st block), the expected time should be 0 seconds, but the program would erroneously calculate a non-zero time.
