According to the code, the loop iterates over the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be another element in the `results` list beyond the current `result`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in the list. For the loop to execute again, the list must have at least 4 elements, and `result` should refer to the fourth element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list with at least 4 elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the fourth element in the list**
