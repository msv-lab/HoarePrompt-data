To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

1. The variable `i` is 3.
2. The condition `s[i - 1] == '0'` will influence the value assigned to `prefix_balances[i]`. The character `s[i - 1]` corresponds to `s[2]`.
3. The value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` remains unchanged.
4. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_balances` must have at least 4 elements (from index 0 to index 3).

Now, we need to establish the impact of the code:
- If `s[2] == '0'`, then `prefix_balances[i]` will be updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1`.
- If `s[2] != '0'`, then `prefix_balances[i]` will be updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1`.

However, we do not know the specific values of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` or `s[2]`. Thus, we can only express the output state in terms of conditions.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `s[2]`, `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is unchanged, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3**.
