Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with -1. If `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with 0. If `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1, and `results` is either appended with -1 or 0 based on the presence of `x` in the list.***
