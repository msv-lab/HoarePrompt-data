According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n + 1`, which means that the last value of `i` that allows for the loop to execute is `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2. The length of `prefix_balances` (which is `n + 1`) remains constant, and no other states need to be adjusted since the other variables are not affected by this increment.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is 2**
