According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. The loop will continue executing as long as there are elements in the `results` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, and `result` is the second element in the list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in the `results` list after the second element. Therefore, the `results` list must have at least 3 elements, and since `result` is the second element in the list, for the next iteration, `result` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list with at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the third element in the list**
