The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `s` will be assigned the value of `data[3]`. The variable `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer from data[index], `x` is assigned the value of int(data[2]), `s` is the value of data[3], `data` is a list containing at least one element, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
