The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. Since `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `prefix_balances[i - 1]` will be `0` at this point. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` will evaluate to either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is `'0'` or not. Therefore, the value of `prefix_balances[i]` will be `1` if `s[i - 1]` is `'0'`, and `-1` if it is not.

Assuming `s` is defined and has at least `i` characters, the output state will reflect the updated state of `prefix_balances`. Since the values of `s` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `prefix_balances[i]`, but we can express it in terms of the condition.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is 1**
