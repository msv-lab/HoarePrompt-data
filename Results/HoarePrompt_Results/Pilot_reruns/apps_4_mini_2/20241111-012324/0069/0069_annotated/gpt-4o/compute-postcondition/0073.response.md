The `index` variable is incremented by 3. This means that the current value of `index` is increased, which will affect how subsequent data is accessed from the `data` list. Other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `index`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, with `prefix_balances[0]` being 0; `results` is updated based on the previous conditions; `T` is incremented by 1; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`; `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]; `index` is incremented by 3**
