Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, and `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`. If the value of `x - b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
