Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` (and `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`), the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that division by zero is avoided and handling cases where `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`.***
