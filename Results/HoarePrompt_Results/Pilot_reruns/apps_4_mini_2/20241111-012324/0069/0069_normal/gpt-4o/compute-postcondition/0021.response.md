The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, but there is no information about the `results` list. Since the code modifies `results` by appending a value, we note that the `results` list is updated. The state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `0` to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the prefix balance values for each index from 1 to `n`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's for the first `i` characters of `s`; `results` has a new element `0` appended.**
