The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `b` is 0, `count` is 2.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `b` is 0, `count` is 2**
