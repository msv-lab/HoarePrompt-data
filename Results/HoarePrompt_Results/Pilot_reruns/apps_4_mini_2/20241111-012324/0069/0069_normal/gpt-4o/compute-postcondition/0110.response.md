Output State: **If T is greater than 0, results contains the printed values, which could be -1, 0, or counts based on the evaluations performed within the loop. If T is 0, the loop does not execute, and results remains an empty list. If balance is 0, results will contain either -1 or 0, depending on whether x is found in prefix_balances. If balance is not 0, results will contain the count of valid indices where the specified conditions are met.**
