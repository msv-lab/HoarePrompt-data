According to the code, the loop is designed to execute for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To allow for one more iteration, the value of `i` must be incremented to 2. Since `n` is at least 1, it can still accommodate an increment of `i`.

Thus, we adjust the state to reflect that `i` would be 2 for the next iteration. The conditions for `prefix_balances` and `n` do not need to be changed since `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length greater than 1, and `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[0]**
