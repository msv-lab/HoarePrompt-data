According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will become 4 in the next iteration. Therefore, `n` must also be at least 4 to ensure the loop can continue executing. 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 4.
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4.

The values of `prefix_balances[i]` and `prefix_balances[i - 1]` do not need to be adjusted as they depend on the state of the loop body, which is omitted here.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 3, 1, 1, -1, -1, or -3; `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is either 2, 0, or -2; `i` is 4; `n` is greater than or equal to 4**
