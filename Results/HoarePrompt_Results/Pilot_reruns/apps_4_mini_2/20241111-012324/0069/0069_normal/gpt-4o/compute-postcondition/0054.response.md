Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones based on the string `s`. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` has -1 appended to it. Otherwise, `results` has 0 appended to it. The state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged regardless of the condition.***
