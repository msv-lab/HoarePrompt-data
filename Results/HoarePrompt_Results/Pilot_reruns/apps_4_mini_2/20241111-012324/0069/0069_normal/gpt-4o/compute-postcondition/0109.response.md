According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has more than 3 values, the loop can proceed once more. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 3 values, and `result` is currently the third value in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must contain at least 4 values, and `result` should be updated to the fourth value in the list. Additionally, since the loop iterates over each value in `results`, the index would need to be incremented to reflect that the next `result` will be the fourth value.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` contains at least 4 values, `result` is the fourth value in the list**
