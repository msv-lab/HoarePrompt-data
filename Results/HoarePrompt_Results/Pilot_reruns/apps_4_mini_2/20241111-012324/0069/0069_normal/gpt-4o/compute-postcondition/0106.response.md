The code will print the value of `result`, which is the second value in the list `results`. The variables `T` and `results` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current values of `T`, `results`, and the fact that `result` is printed.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` contains at least 2 values, `result` is the second value in the list, and the function prints `result`.**
