According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n`. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2 or 0 or 0 or -2; `i` is 3; `n` is at least 3**
