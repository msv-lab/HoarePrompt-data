The code appends `-1` to the `results` list, which adds a new element to it. The value of `prefix_balances` is not directly affected by this operation, and the previous state of `results` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `-1` has been added to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the prefix balance values, and `-1` has been appended to `results`**.
