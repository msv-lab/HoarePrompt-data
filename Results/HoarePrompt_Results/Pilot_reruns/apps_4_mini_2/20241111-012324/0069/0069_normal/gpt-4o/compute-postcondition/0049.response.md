The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the result of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is not specified, but it is a value from the list of zeros. The conditional expression evaluates to either `1` or `-1` based on whether `s[i - 1]` is '0' or not. 

Let's denote the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` as `x`. Thus:
- If `s[i - 1] == '0'`, then `prefix_balances[i] = x + 1`.
- If `s[i - 1] != '0'`, then `prefix_balances[i] = x - 1`.

Since `prefix_balances` is initialized with zeros and the length is greater than 1, the state of `prefix_balances[i]` can be either `1` or `-1`, depending on the condition.

Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `i` is 3, `n` is >= 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is either `x + 1` or `x - 1`, where `x` is the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `i` is 3, `n` is >= 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is either `x + 1` or `x - 1`**.
