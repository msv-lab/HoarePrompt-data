Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the prefix balance values for each index from 1 to `n`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's for the first `i` characters of `s`. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`. If `x` is not found, `0` is appended to `results`. If `n` is 0, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and the results will append `0` since `x` cannot be in an empty list.***
