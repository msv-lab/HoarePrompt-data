Postcondition: ***`balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. This handles the case where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, potentially leading to division by zero, by ensuring that the modulus operation is only evaluated when `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`. Additionally, the function can handle scenarios where `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `balance`, as well as cases where `cnt0` or `cnt1` may be zero.
