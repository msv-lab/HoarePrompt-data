Output State: **`balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `T` is greater than `current_iteration`, or `T` is adjusted to `current_iteration + 1`; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is updated to `cnt0 - cnt1`.**
