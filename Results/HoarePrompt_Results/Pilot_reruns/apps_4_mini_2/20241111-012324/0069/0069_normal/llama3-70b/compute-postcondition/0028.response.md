The expression inside the print statement evaluates the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The variable `balance` is already defined as `cnt0 - cnt1`, so we can substitute that into the expression.

First, we simplify the expression:
- `x - balance` becomes `x - (cnt0 - cnt1)` which simplifies to `x - cnt0 + cnt1`.
- The denominator `cnt0 - cnt1` remains as is.

Therefore, the expression becomes:
```
print((x - cnt0 + cnt1) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)
```

The print function will output the result of the entire expression. However, the values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are not specified, but they are known to be the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.

Thus, the output state contains:
- `balance` is updated to `cnt0 - cnt1`,
- and the output will be the result of the print statement.

Output State: **`balance` is updated to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the print statement outputs the result of (x - cnt0 + cnt1) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1**
