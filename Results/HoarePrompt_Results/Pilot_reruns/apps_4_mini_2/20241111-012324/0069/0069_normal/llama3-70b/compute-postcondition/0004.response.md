The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the values of the counts of '0' and '1' in the binary string `s`, respectively. The values of `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged, but `cnt0` will hold the count of '0's in `s`, and `cnt1` will hold the count of '1's in `s`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the newly computed counts.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a new input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`**
