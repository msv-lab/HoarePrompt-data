Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the string `s` has a balance of `0` (i.e., `cnt0` equals `cnt1`). Specifically, when `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the balance becomes `0`, and we can consider if `x` is also `0`. 

1. If `balance == x == 0`, the program outputs `n + 1`, which is incorrect because it implies that there are `n + 1` prefixes with a balance of `0`, but it should actually indicate that there are infinitely many prefixes with a balance of `0` (which should return `-1`).

2. If `balance == 0` but `x` is not `0`, then the output should also be `0`, because there are no prefixes with a balance equal to `x`. However, the logic in the program would still incorrectly attempt to compute the number of prefixes.

For example:
- For the input:
```
1 0
01
```
The program would output `-1`, which is incorrect because there are no prefixes with balance `0` since `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, and hence the balance is `0`.

Thus, the program fails to handle these edge cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.
