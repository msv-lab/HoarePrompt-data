To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and how it relates to the requirements outlined.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes `n` (the number of operations) and `a` (the list of target values).

2. **Sorting**: The sequence `a` is sorted, which ensures that we can process values in increasing order.

3. **Set Initialization**: A set named `assigned` is initialized with the first value of `a`, and a variable `m` (the count of variables) is initialized to 1.

4. **Loop Through Values**: The program iterates through the rest of the values in `a`:
   - For each value `a[i]`, it checks if it can be formed by adding any two previously assigned values (stored in `assigned`).
   - If it can be formed (i.e., `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned` for some `x`), it proceeds without increasing `m`.
   - If it cannot be formed, it increments `m` and adds `a[i]` to `assigned`.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the value of `m`.

### Analysis Against Problem Description:

The problem states that we need the minimum number of variables `m` to perform a sequence of operations where each operation can either assign a value directly or compute a new value as the sum of two previously assigned values.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Case with Non-formable Values**: The program checks if `a[i]` can be formed by previously assigned values. However, it does not account for cases where `a[i]` is less than the smallest possible sum of any two distinct previously assigned values. For instance:
   - If `n = 3` and `a = [2, 3, 5]`, the program will incorrectly assume that `m = 2` is sufficient, while in reality, we cannot form the required operations given the nature of summation. 

2. **Direct Assignment Requirement**: The program's logic does not ensure that all values can always be formed when required. If you have a value that is simply not reachable by the sum of distinct variables, the function may incorrectly increment `m` without considering the impossibility of fulfilling the requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the potential edge case where the program fails to recognize that certain values cannot be formed by the sums of previously assigned values, the program does not fulfill the problem description correctly in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
