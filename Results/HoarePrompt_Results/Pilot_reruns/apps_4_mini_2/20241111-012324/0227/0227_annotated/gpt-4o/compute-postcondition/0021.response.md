Postcondition: ***`assigned` is a set containing at least one distinct integer `a[0]` from the sorted list `a`, `n` is at least 2, and `m` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `can_form`. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being 2. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains 1. The value of `i` remains 1 throughout the execution.***
