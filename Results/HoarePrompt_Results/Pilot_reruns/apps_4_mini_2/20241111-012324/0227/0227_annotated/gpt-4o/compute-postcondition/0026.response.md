The value of `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, and this change does not affect the values of other variables (`assigned`, `n`, `m`, `i`). Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` is a non-empty set of distinct integers, `n` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2 depending on `can_form`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is now True.

Output State: **`assigned` is a non-empty set of distinct integers, `n` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2 depending on `can_form`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True**
