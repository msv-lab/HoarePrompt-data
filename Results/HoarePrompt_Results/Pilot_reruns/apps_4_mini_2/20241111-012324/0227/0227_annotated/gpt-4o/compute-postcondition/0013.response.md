Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]` and another distinct integer from `a`, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, the values of `can_form`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and the contents of `assigned` remain unchanged.***
