Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` contains the element `a[current_i + 3]`, and `x` is equal to `a[current_i + 3]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, ensuring that `can_form` remains True. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, then the program continues without changing the values of `can_form`, `m`, or `assigned`.***
