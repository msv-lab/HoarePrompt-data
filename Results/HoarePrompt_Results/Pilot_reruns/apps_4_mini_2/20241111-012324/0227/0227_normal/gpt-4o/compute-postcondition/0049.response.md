The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state indicates that `can_form` was previously `False`, so after the execution, its value changes to `True`. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes at least one more element, `i` is k + 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes at least one more element, `i` is k + 1**
