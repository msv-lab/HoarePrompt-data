Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False initially, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes at least one more element, and `i` is equal to `k + 1`. If the value of `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False.***
