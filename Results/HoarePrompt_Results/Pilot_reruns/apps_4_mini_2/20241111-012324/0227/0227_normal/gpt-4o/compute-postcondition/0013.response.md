Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 2 distinct elements from `a`, `m` is 1, and `x` is one of the distinct elements in `assigned` that is not `a[0]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating that a valid combination can be formed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing the subsequent statements.***
