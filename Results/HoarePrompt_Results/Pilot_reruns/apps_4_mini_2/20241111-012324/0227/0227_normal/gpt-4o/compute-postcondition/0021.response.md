Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such element exists, `can_form` is False, and in this case, the value of `m` is incremented by 1. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False, and `m` is also incremented by 1. Thus, if `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, while if `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged.***
