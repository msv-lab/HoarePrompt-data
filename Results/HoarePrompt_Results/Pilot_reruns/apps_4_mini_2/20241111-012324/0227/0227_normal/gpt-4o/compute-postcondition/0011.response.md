The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This does not change any of the other variables, which retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state reflects that `can_form` is now `True` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 2 distinct elements from `a`, `m` is 1, `x` is one of the distinct elements in `assigned` that is not `a[0]`, and `can_form` is True**.
