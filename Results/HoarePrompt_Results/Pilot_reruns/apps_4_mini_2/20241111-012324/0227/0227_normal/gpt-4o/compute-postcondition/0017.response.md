Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 2 distinct elements from `a`, `m` is 1, and `x` is the next distinct element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the value of `can_form` remains unchanged and the loop continues (if present).***
