The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that must be between 1 and 23. The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. Based on these inputs, the function will perform certain operations (not specified in the task) and will return a result. However, the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (between 1 and 23) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and 10^9).**
