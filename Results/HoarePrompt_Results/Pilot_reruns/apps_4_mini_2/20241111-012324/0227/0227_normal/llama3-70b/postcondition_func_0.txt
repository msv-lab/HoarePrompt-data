The function accepts a positive integer `n` (between 1 and 23) and a list `a` of `n` integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list `a` do not satisfy the condition `a[i] == a[i - 1] * 2` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`. If `m`, the count of such elements, is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle input errors or validate that the integers in the list are distinct or within specified bounds.
