The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, and since it was initially 0, after execution, `depublicans` will be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
