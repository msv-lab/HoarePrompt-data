The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. Since it is stated that `depublicans` is incremented to 1 if the first character is 'D' and remains 0 otherwise, this means that if the first character is 'D', `depublicans` will change from 1 to 2. If the first character is not 'D', `depublicans` will change from 0 to 1. Therefore, the output state will reflect both possibilities.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`; `depublicans` is either 2 if the first character is 'D' or 1 if the first character is not 'D'; `remocrats` remains unchanged.**
