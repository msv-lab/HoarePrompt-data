Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is empty and `r_queue` is empty initially. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` will contain one element, which is `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` remains empty, leading to an IndexError if a pop operation is attempted on `r_queue`. Conversely, if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `d_queue` will remain empty, and `r_queue` will contain one element, which is `r_index + n`. In both cases, the other queue will remain empty, and an attempt to pop from the empty queue will result in an IndexError.***
