Output State: **If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute, leaving d_queue and r_queue unchanged. If both queues are empty at the start, the loop will not execute, and both queues will remain empty. If d_queue and r_queue are not empty, the loop executes as long as both queues contain elements. After each iteration, one element is removed from each queue, and one is added back to the respective queue according to the comparison of d_index and r_index. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue will contain d_index + n, while r_queue will be empty. If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, r_queue will contain r_index + n, while d_queue will be empty. The loop will terminate when one of the queues becomes empty. The output state reflects that at the end of the loop, either d_queue or r_queue will be empty, and the other will contain values based on the last comparisons.**
