Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, the value `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, the value `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. In either case, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` after popping it. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` represent the first elements of their respective queues at the time of execution.***
