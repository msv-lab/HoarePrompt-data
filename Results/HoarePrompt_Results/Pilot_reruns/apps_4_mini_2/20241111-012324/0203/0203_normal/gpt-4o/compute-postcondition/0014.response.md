The statement `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `r_queue`. Assuming `r_queue` was previously defined as a list, its state will change to include the new element. The values of `n`, `votes`, and `v` remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `votes` is an input string of length `n`; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`, and `r_queue` now includes the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `votes` is an input string of length `n`; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`; `r_queue` now includes the value 2**
