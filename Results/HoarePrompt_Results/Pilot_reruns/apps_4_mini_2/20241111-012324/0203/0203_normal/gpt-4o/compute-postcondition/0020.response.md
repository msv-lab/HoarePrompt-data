The operation `d_queue.append(d_index + n)` attempts to append the result of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` is initially empty, it will now contain one element. However, the values of `d_index` and `n` are not specified, so their values remain unknown, but they will determine the value being appended. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains one element `d_index + n`, `r_queue` is empty, and an attempt to pop from `r_queue` results in an IndexError due to the queue being empty.**
