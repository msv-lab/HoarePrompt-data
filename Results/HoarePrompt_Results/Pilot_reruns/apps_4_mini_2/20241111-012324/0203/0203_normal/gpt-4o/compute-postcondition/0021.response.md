The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. Given that `d_queue` and `r_queue` are both initially empty, the operation modifies `r_queue` by adding an element to it. The previous state of `r_queue` is empty, and now it will contain one element. The index error when popping from `r_queue` does not affect this operation since we are only appending to it.

Output State: **`d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` contains `r_index + n`**
