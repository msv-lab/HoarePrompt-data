Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. It simulates a voting process where votes from 'D' and 'R' are processed in a queue-like manner. The function prints 'D' if there are remaining 'D' votes after processing, otherwise it prints 'R' if all 'D' votes are consumed. The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `n` is outside the range or `votes` contains invalid characters).**
