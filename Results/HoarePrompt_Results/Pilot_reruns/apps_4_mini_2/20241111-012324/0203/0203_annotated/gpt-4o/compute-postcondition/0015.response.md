Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `n`; and `v` is the character at index `n`, which does not exist. If `v` is equal to 'D', then `d_queue` is appended with `i` (which is `n`). Otherwise, `r_queue` is appended with `i` (which is `n`). This ensures that `d_queue` will contain `n` if the last character of `votes` is 'D', while `r_queue` will contain `n` if it is not.
