According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `votes`, with `i` being the index and `v` the character at that index. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n` (the length of the string) and `v` is the character at index `n`, which does not exist, the loop cannot execute again since `i` is equal to `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. This means that `i` should be adjusted to `n - 1`, which will point to the last character in the string `votes`. The character `v` will then be the character at index `n - 1`. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be `n - 1`.
- `v` should be the character at index `n - 1` of `votes`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `v` is the character at index `n - 1` of `votes`**.
