Postcondition: ***`d_index` is the first element popped from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now one element shorter, and `r_index` is the first element popped from `r_queue`, which is also now one element shorter. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` is increased by one element with the addition of `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is increased by one element with the addition of `r_index + n`. In all cases, `d_queue` and `r_queue` reflect the respective updates based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`.***
