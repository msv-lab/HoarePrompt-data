The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The values of `d_index` and `n` are needed to calculate the new value being appended. Since `d_queue` is not empty, it will accept the new value without any issues. The `r_queue` and `r_index` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has `d_index + n` appended to it; `r_queue` is not empty, `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`.**
