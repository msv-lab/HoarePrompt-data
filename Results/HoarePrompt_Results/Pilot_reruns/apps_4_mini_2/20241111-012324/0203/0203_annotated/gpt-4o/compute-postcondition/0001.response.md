The value of `votes` is assigned the value from `input().strip()`, which captures a string input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state specified that `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R'. Therefore, after this assignment, `votes` will contain the input string while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'**
