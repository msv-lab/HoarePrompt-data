The variable `i` is appended to the list `r_queue`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the value that is appended is the positive integer `n`, which is within the range of 1 to 200000. The state of the other variables (`votes`, `v`) is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, and `r_queue` now contains the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, and `r_queue` now contains the value of `n`**
