You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n employees in Alternative Cake Manufacturing (ACM). They are now voting on some very important question and the leading world media are trying to predict the outcome of the vote.

Each of the employees belongs to one of two fractions: depublicans or remocrats, and these two fractions have opposite opinions on what should be the outcome of the vote. The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).  When employee makes a statement, he can do nothing or declare that one of the other employees no longer has a right to vote. It's allowed to deny from voting people who already made the statement or people who are only waiting to do so. If someone is denied from voting he no longer participates in the voting till the very end.  When all employees are done with their statements, the procedure repeats: again, each employees starting from 1 and finishing with n who are still eligible to vote make their statements.  The process repeats until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining and he determines the outcome of the whole voting. Of course, he votes for the decision suitable for his fraction. 

You know the order employees are going to vote and that they behave optimal (and they also know the order and who belongs to which fraction). Predict the outcome of the vote.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of employees. 

The next line contains n characters. The i-th character is 'D' if the i-th employee is from depublicans fraction or 'R' if he is from remocrats.


-----Output-----

Print 'D' if the outcome of the vote will be suitable for depublicans and 'R' if remocrats will win.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
DDRRR

Output
D

Input
6
DDRRRR

Output
R



-----Note-----

Consider one of the voting scenarios for the first sample:   Employee 1 denies employee 5 to vote.  Employee 2 denies employee 3 to vote.  Employee 3 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 2).  Employee 4 denies employee 2 to vote.  Employee 5 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 1).  Employee 1 denies employee 4.  Only employee 1 now has the right to vote so the voting ends with the victory of depublicans.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `votes` remains a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'
    votes = input().strip()
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'
    d_queue = []
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list
    r_queue = []
    #State of the program here: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list
    for (i, v) in enumerate(votes):
        if v == 'D':
            d_queue.append(i)
        else:
            r_queue.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all 'R' characters in `votes`. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `n` is at least 1, then the loop executes `n` times, and `i` will range from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.
    while d_queue and r_queue:
        d_index = d_queue.pop(0)
        
        r_index = r_queue.pop(0)
        
        if d_index < r_index:
            d_queue.append(d_index + n)
        else:
            r_queue.append(r_index + n)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: if `votes` is an empty string, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty and the loop does not execute. If `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty during execution, the loop will terminate. After the loop executes, if `d_queue` is non-empty, it contains indices of 'D' characters that have won in comparisons, and if `r_queue` is non-empty, it contains indices of 'R' characters that have won. The loop will execute as long as both queues have elements. If both queues become empty, the loop will stop, and the final state will reflect the remaining indices in either queue or indicate that both are empty.
    if d_queue :
        print('D')
        #State of the program here: `votes` is an empty string, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty, and the loop does not execute; 'D' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `votes` is an empty string, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty, and the loop does not execute; 'D' is printed.
    else :
        print('R')
        #State of the program here: `votes` is an empty string; `d_queue` is empty; `r_queue` is empty; the loop does not execute; and 'R' is printed.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: `votes` is an empty string; `d_queue` is empty; `r_queue` is empty; the loop does not execute; and 'R' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed; if `d_queue` is empty, 'R' is printed. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are empty, 'R' will be printed, indicating that no characters have won. If `votes` is an empty string, both queues remain empty and the loop does not execute, leading to the same output behavior.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. It evaluates the votes through a process of pairwise comparisons, where the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters are compared. The function determines which character wins based on these comparisons, and prints 'D' if 'D' characters remain after all comparisons, otherwise it prints 'R'. If there are no votes (an empty string), it defaults to printing 'R'.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
