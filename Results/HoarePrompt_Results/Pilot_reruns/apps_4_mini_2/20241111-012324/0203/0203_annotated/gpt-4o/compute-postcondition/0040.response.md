The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \). The parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. After executing the function body, it evaluates the votes and returns the result based on the counts of 'D' and 'R'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `votes`, then return a result based on the evaluation of the votes represented by the characters in the string.
