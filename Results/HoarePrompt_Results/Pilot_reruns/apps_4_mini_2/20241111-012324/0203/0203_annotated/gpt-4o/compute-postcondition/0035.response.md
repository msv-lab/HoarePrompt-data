According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions of `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, so the loop can indeed execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the current state.

State: **`d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty**
