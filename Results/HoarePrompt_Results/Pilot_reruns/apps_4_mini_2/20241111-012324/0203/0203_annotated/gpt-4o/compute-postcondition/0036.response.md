Output State: **if `votes` is an empty string, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty and the loop does not execute. If `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty during execution, the loop will terminate. After the loop executes, if `d_queue` is non-empty, it contains indices of 'D' characters that have won in comparisons, and if `r_queue` is non-empty, it contains indices of 'R' characters that have won. The loop will execute as long as both queues have elements. If both queues become empty, the loop will stop, and the final state will reflect the remaining indices in either queue or indicate that both are empty.**
