Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R'. If the first character `v` of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [0] and `r_queue` is empty. If `v` is 'R', then `d_queue` is empty and `r_queue` contains [0].***
