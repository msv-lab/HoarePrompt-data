Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. After this operation, `r_index` holds the value of the first element of the original `r_queue` before it was removed. Additionally, if `d_queue` was empty before the operation, it will contain one element after the operation if the if condition is true, and `r_queue` will be non-empty regardless of the condition. If `r_queue` was empty before the operation, it will remain non-empty after the operation. Thus, both queues will contain updated values based on the comparisons made.***
