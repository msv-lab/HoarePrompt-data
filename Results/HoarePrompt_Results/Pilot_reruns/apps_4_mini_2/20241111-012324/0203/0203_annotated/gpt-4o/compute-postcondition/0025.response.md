The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is then removed from `r_queue`. The state of `d_queue` is not affected, but `r_queue` will now be one element smaller. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of the original `r_queue` and removed from it.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of the original `r_queue` and removed from it.**
