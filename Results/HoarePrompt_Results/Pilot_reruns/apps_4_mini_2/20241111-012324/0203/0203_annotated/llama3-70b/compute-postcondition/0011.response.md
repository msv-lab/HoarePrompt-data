Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `fraction` is the next character in the string. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1. If `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1. This ensures that all characters in the string are accounted for, and only 'D' increments `depublicans` while any other character increments `remocrats`.***
