The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. There are no other variables affected, and the previous state of `n` and `fractions` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `depublicans` while retaining the values of `n` and `fractions`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 0**
