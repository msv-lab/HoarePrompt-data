According to the code, the for loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `0` (as it is the last value in the range), which means the loop cannot execute again since `i` will then become `-1`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted so that `k - 1` is at least `0`. Since `k` is currently greater than or equal to `1`, keeping it the same would still prevent another iteration. Therefore, `k` should be incremented by at least `1` to ensure that `k - 1` is greater than `0`, allowing for a valid next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence[i]` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is one less than its previous value, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
