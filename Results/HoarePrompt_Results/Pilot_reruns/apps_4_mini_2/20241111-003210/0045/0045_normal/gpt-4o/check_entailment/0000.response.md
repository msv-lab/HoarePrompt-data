To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. If such a sequence cannot be formed, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.

2. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers.
   - If `min_sum > n`, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to form such a sequence.

3. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - The program calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which determines the base multiple for the sequence.
   - It initializes a sequence of the first `k` positive integers multiplied by `d`.
   - After that, it allocates any remaining value from `n` into the sequence to ensure the total sum equals `n`.

4. **Sequence Adjustment**: 
   - The program adjusts the last elements of the sequence to account for the remainder by incrementing elements of the sequence until the remainder is exhausted.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **When `k = 1`**: The program should return `[n]` since the only number in the sequence is `n` itself.
- **When `n < k`**: The program should return `-1` since we can't have `k` positive integers that sum to less than `k`.
- **Large Values of `n` and `k`**: Given that `n` and `k` can go up to `10^10`, we should ensure that the calculations remain efficient and do not cause overflow or performance issues.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints explain that the function checks if the minimum possible sum exceeds `n`, which aligns with the program's logic. They also mention how the sequence is generated and adjusted based on the calculated `d` and the remainder. 

### Conclusion:
After reviewing both the code and the problem description, I found that:
- The program correctly handles the case where `min_sum` exceeds `n`.
- It appropriately calculates the sequence and adjusts it to ensure the sum equals `n`.
- The program seems to produce valid outputs for the given examples.

However, an edge case that could potentially cause issues is when `k` is very large relative to `n`. For instance, if `k` is larger than `n`, the program should return `-1`, which it does. 

Thus, I do not see any scenario where the program fails to meet the problem description, as it handles the edge cases appropriately and correctly constructs the sequence.

Correctness: **True**.
