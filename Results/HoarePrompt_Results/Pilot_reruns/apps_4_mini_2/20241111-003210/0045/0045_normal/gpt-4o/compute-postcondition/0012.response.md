The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `remainder = n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the first `k` multiples of `d`, `i` is `k - 2`, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
