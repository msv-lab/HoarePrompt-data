According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is now 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be a non-zero value. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is greater than 0**
