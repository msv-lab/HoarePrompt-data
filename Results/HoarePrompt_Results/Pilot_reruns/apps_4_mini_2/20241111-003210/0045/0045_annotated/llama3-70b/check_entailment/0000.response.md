To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the program logic and the provided annotations carefully. 

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to construct a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. If it is impossible to create such a sequence, the output should be `-1`.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Strictly Increasing Sequence**: The sequence must consist of distinct positive integers.
2. **Sum Equals `n`**: The sum of the sequence must equal the provided integer `n`.
3. **GCD Maximization**: The GCD of the sequence must be the highest possible.

### Annotations Recap:
The provided annotated program defines a function that calculates the GCD of two numbers but does not directly relate to the construction of the sequence or the requirements of the problem.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the GCD of `a` and `b`. However, based on the problem description, we need to create a sequence of `k` integers rather than just calculating a GCD.
- The annotations mention that if both parameters of the GCD function are zero, it returns `0`, which does not apply to our context since `n` and `k` are positive integers.
- The problem does not provide any mechanism for constructing the sequence of integers or checking whether it's possible to do so given `n` and `k`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: When `n` and `k` are both 1, the output should be `1`.
2. **Impossible Cases**: If `n` is less than the sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, it should return `-1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the smallest possible sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is greater than `5`.
3. **General Cases**: The program should also ensure that the generated sequence meets the conditions of being strictly increasing, summing to `n`, and having a maximized GCD.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program does not provide any logic for forming the sequence, nor does it handle edge cases such as when it's impossible to form the sequence. Therefore, since the code does not adhere to the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to account for the requirement of constructing a valid sequence of integers that meets the sum and GCD conditions, specifically lacking logic for handling cases where such a sequence cannot be formed.
