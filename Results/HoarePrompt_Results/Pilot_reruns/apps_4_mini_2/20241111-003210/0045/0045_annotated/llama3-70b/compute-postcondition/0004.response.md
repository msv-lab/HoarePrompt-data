The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b` and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Given that `a` is `n % k` and `b` is not equal to 0, the new values of `a` and `b` will be based on the calculations involving these initial values. 

1. `a` gets the value of `b`, which is not equal to 0.
2. `b` gets the value of `a % b`, which will be the result of the modulus operation. Since `a` is `n % k`, `a % b` will depend on the specific values of `n`, `k`, and `b`, but `b` will still retain its non-zero status.

Thus, after execution, `a` will hold the previous value of `b`, and `b` will hold the value of `a % b`. Since `a` was initially `n % k`, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is `n % k % b`**
