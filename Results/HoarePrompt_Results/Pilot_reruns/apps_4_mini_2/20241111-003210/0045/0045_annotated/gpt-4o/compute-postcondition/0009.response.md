Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
