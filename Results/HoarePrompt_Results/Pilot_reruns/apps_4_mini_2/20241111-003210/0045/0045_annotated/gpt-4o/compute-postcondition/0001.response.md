The function returns `-1`, which signifies an error or a specific condition being met. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the return statement. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; and the function returns -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; and the function returns -1**
