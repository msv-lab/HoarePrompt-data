The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). 

In Case 1, if the calculated value `min_sum`, which is equal to \(k \times (k + 1) // 2\), is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. In this case, no other return occurs, and the state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged. 

In Case 2, if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, the function returns the sequence as it is, without any modifications.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and it returns -1 if the minimum sum required by `k` exceeds `n`. If the condition is satisfied, it returns the sequence unchanged. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, and returns -1 if the minimum sum calculated from k exceeds n; otherwise, it returns the sequence unchanged.**
