Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`. If the `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop terminates, and the internal state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the `remainder` is decreased by 1, and the `sequence` is updated to include the elements `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`, with `sequence[i]` (where `i` is `k - 2`) incremented by 1. The program effectively handles cases where the `remainder` might be zero, ensuring the termination of the loop when appropriate.***
