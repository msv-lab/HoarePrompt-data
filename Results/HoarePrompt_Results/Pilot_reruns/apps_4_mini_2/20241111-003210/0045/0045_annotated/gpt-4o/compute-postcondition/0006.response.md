According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as it iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. Given that `k` is a positive integer in the range `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10`, it ensures that the loop will execute. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to `k - 1`, which is the starting value for the loop. It will decrement until it reaches `0`. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `k` must be at least 1 (which it is, as per the given state).
- `i` is initialized to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`, `i` is `k - 1`**
