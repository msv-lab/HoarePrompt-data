In the given initial state, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). The code calculates `total_days` as \(1\) shifted left by `n` bits, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). 

Since the problem states that if `k` is greater than \(2^n\), the function prints `(1, 1)` and returns, we need to evaluate the situation based on the value of `k` relative to \(2^n\). However, the current code only computes `total_days` and does not check or alter any other states.

Thus, the output state reflects the calculation of `total_days` without any condition being met to change the output further.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is \(2^n\)**
