The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `n` must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` must satisfy the constraint 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. In all other cases, where `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, there is no action taken, and the function proceeds without output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds 2 raised to the power of `n`, it prints (1, 1) and returns; otherwise, it performs no action. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than 2^n; if `k` is less than or equal to 2^n, it does nothing.**
