To determine the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, we will analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Code Analysis

The problem description requires calculating the probability that at least two people out of `k` have the same birthday among `2^n` days. The output should be given as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It appears to work correctly, as it uses the Euclidean algorithm.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, k)`
1. **Input Check**: It checks if `k` is greater than \( 2^n \). If so, it correctly returns \( (1, 1) \) since it guarantees at least one shared birthday.
2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - It calculates the number of ways to select `k` people such that no two people share the same birthday (the numerator).
   - It calculates the total possible birthday assignments (the denominator).
   - It then computes the probability of at least two sharing a birthday by subtracting the non-shared from the total.

3. **GCD Reduction**: It reduces \( A \) and \( B \) by their GCD, which is correctly implemented.

### Edge Cases
1. **When `k = 1`**: The function does not explicitly handle this case, but the logic implies that if `k` is 1, the probability of sharing a birthday is zero. The function does not need to handle this as stated, but it’s good to note.
2. **When `k` is very large**: If `k` exceeds \( 2^n \), the function correctly handles it.
3. **When `n` is at its maximum (e.g., \( 10^{18} \))**: The calculations should be handled carefully due to potential integer overflow, but Python handles large integers well.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints state that the function computes the probability correctly and that it handles the case where `k > 2^n` by returning (1, 1). The hints also mention that if `k` is zero or negative, additional handling is not defined, which aligns with the logic in the code since `k` is restricted in the input description.

### Conclusion
The code correctly implements the solution according to the problem description for valid inputs specified (i.e., `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`). There is no edge case where the code fails to provide the correct output based on the requirements stated in the problem description.

Therefore, the overall assessment of the correctness is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The implementation handles all specified cases correctly, and the output hints support this assessment.
