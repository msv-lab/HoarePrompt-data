According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is between 2 and \(10^{18}\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `k` remains the same. Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is for `i` to indicate the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 1), `denominator` is 2^n * total_days, `i` is 2**
