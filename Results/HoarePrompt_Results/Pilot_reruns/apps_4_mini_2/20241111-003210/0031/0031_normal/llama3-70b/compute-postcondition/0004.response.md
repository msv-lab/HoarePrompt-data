The `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days - i`. The initial value of `numerator` is 1, and `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\). The value of `i` is 0, so we calculate \(total\_days - i\) which is \(2^n - 0 = 2^n\).

Thus, the new value of `numerator` is \(1 \times (2^n) = 2^n\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
