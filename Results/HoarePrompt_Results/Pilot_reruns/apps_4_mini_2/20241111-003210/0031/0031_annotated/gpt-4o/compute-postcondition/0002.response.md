The return statement indicates that the function terminates and returns control to the caller. There are no changes made to the values of `n`, `k`, or `MOD`, and the function does not return any value. However, the print statement indicates that (1, 1) was output before the return. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables and the fact that the function has ended.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the function prints (1, 1) before returning.**
