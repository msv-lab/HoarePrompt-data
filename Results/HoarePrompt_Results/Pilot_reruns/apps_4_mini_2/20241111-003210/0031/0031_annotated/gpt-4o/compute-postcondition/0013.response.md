According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, we also need to ensure that `k` is greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is updated to `new_numerator`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % 1000003`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2**
