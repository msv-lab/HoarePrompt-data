Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than \(2^n\), the function prints (1, 1) and returns without further execution. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), the function calculates two values based on the products of certain terms and then divides these values by the result of another function `func_1`. Finally, it prints the results of these divisions modulo 1000003. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. **
