The variable `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`. The previous state shows that `p_shared` was calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD. The values of `numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD` are not provided, but `A` will take on the value of `p_shared` as calculated. Therefore, the output state reflects that `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `p_shared` retain their previous values, and `A` is now equal to `p_shared`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD, and `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`**.
