The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and it calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initialized to 0, the function will return `a` immediately, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. The function effectively implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.
