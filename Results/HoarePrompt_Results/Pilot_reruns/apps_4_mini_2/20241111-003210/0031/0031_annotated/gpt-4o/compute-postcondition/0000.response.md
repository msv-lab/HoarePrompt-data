The code assigns a value to the variable `MOD`, which is calculated as \(10^6 + 3\). This results in `MOD` being equal to `1000003`. The variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `k`, and the newly assigned value of `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003**
