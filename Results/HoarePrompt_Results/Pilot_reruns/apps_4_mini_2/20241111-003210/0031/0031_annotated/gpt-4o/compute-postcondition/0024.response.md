The value of `A` is divided by `g`, and while the exact values of `A` and `g` are not provided in the initial state, the operation affects `A` directly. The value of `B` remains unchanged, and other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD, `A` is updated to `A // g`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is the result of func_1 with arguments `A` and `B`.
