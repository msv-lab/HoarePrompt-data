`total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 10^18. The value of `total_days` will be a very large number, specifically equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated value of `total_days` along with the existing values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
