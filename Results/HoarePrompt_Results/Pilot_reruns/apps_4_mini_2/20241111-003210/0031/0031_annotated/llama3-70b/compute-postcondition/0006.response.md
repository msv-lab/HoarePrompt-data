According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and it must remain less than `k`, which is still at least 2.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be incremented to 1. 
- `k` remains the same, as it is at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is `total_days`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
