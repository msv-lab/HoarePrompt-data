Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where both input strings are empty after stripping leading zeroes. According to the problem description, both inputs are non-negative integers, which means they can include leading zeroes, and in the case where both inputs are just zeroes (like "0" and "0"), the `lstrip('0')` method will result in empty strings for both `a` and `b`. 

In this scenario, the comparison `if (a == b)` would evaluate to `True`, and it would print '='. However, if both inputs are empty strings (which could happen if the input was simply two zeroes), the logic does not account for that explicitly, leading to incorrect behavior. 

The annotations mention that the function does not handle cases where the input strings may be empty, which is crucial since the problem allows for leading zeroes and does not specify that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer representation. This potential edge case shows that the code fails to adhere to the problem description in every potential case. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements as described, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
