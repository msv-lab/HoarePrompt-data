The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '='. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as this line does not modify them. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the input string with leading zeroes stripped, and the output is '='.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the input string with leading zeroes stripped, and the output is '='**.
