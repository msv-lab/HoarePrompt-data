The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each string can contain up to \(10^6\) digits. The function performs an operation on these two string representations of integers and returns the result of that operation, which is also represented as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two non-negative integer strings and return the result of an operation on them as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and returns the result of an operation on them as a string.**
