Postcondition: ***`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, or '0' if empty; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes, and if `b` is initially empty, it is set to '0'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. Otherwise, the output is '='. This covers the cases where both `a` and `b` are empty (resulting in both being '0'), as well as scenarios where one string is lexicographically greater than the other, or they are equal.***
