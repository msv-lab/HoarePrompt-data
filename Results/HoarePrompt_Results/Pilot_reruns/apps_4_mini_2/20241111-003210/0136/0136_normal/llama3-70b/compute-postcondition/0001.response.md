The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it takes an input string and removes any leading zeroes from it. The previous value of `b` as a non-negative integer string is unaffected until this line is executed, and the value of `a` remains unchanged. After the execution, `b` will now be the input value without leading zeroes. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is still the input string without leading zeroes, and `b` is now the input string after leading zeroes have been stripped.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes**
