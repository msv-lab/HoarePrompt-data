The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes and each can have up to \(10^6\) digits. The function performs an operation on these two strings and returns the result. However, the specifics of that operation are not provided in the output details. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two non-negative integer strings, `a` and `b`, and return the result of an operation performed on them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns the result of an operation performed on them.**
