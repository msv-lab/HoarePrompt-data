The value of `a` is assigned the string input after stripping any leading zeroes using `lstrip('0')`. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string which may contain leading zeroes, the result of this operation will be that `a` is updated to a string without leading zeros. If the input was all zeros, `a` would become an empty string. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the new state of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` remains as a non-negative integer represented as a string (unaffected)**
