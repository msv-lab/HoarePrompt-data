The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed using `lstrip('0')`. The initial state indicates that `a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeroes removed, and `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer. The operation on `data[1]` affects only `b`. Assuming `data[1]` is a valid string representation of a non-negative integer, the output state reflects the new value of `b` after leading zeroes are stripped.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, `data` is a list containing the input strings**
