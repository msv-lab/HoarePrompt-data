The code `print('>')` outputs the character '>' to the console. It does not affect any variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variables `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeroes removed, it remains unchanged unless it is an empty string, in which case it is set to '0'. `b` is '0' if it was initially an empty string; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.**
