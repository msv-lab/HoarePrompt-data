Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeroes removed, and it is set to '0' if it was initially an empty string. `b` is '0' if it was initially an empty string; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If both `a` and `b` are equal, the output is '='. This includes all edge cases such as when both `a` and `b` are '0', or when one of them is an empty string.***
