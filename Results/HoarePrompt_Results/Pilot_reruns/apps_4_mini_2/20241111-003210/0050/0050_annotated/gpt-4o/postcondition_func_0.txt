The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It calculates the minimum value from list `s` (the buying prices) and the maximum value from list `b` (the selling prices). If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it computes the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` using the minimum buying price, calculates the remaining bourles after buying shares, and then calculates the total bourles obtainable by selling those shares at the maximum selling price. Finally, it prints the total bourles. The function does not handle cases where either `min_buy_price` or `max_sell_price` could be zero, which could lead to division by zero or invalid calculations.
