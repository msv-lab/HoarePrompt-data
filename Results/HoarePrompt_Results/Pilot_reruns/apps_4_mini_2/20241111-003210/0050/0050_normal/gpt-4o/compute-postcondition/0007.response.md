The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, where `r` is a positive integer and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `max_shares`) are not affected by this operation. 

Since `remaining_bourles` is calculated as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, it will be a non-negative integer. The exact value of `remaining_bourles` will depend on the specific values of `r` and `min_buy_price`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers; `s` is a list of `n` integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_shares` is calculated as r // min_buy_price; `remaining_bourles` is r % min_buy_price.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers; `s` is a list of `n` integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_shares` is calculated as r // min_buy_price; `remaining_bourles` is r % min_buy_price.**
