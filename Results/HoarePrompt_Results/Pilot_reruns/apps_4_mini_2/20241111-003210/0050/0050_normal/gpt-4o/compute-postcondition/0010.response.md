Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of `n` integers representing buying prices of shares, and `b` is a list of integers representing selling prices of shares. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the maximum number of shares that can be bought is calculated as `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, with any remaining bourles calculated as `r` modulo `min_buy_price`. The total bourles is then calculated as the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` plus `remaining_bourles`, and the function prints `total_bourles`. This covers cases where all buying prices are higher than or equal to all selling prices, as well as cases where buying prices allow for profitable selling.***
