Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 1 and 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is increased by `r // s[0]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[0]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, the loop is exited, leaving `shares` initialized to 0 and `i` at 0.***
