The code takes input from the user, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with the new list `s` that contains the integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a list of integers from input**
