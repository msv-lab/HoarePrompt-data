The function `func` accepts no parameters but reads input values directly from the user. It begins by reading three integers: `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `n` and `m` represent the number of elements in the lists `s` and `b`, respectively. It then reads `n` integers into list `s` and `m` integers into list `b`. The function sorts list `s` in ascending order and list `b` in descending order.

The functionality is as follows:
1. It calculates how many shares can be bought based on the integer values in list `s` using the available resources `r`. It updates the number of shares and the remaining resources `r` accordingly.
2. If there are any shares bought, it adds the total value of those shares (calculated using the values in list `b`) back to `r`.
3. Finally, it prints the resulting value of `r`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is 0 or if the input for `s` is empty, the first loop will not execute, and `shares` will remain 0.
- If `shares` is 0 initially, the second loop will not execute, resulting in `r` remaining unchanged.
- The function does not handle invalid input cases, such as if the user provides non-integer values or fewer integers than expected.

Functionality: ** The function reads three integers and two lists of integers, calculates how many shares can be bought with the available resources, updates the resources based on the total value of those shares, and prints the final amount of resources. If no shares can be bought, the resources remain unchanged. **
