The values of `x` and `y` are assigned by taking input and splitting it into two integers. The condition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but it does not specify their exact values. The output state reflects the new values of `x` and `y` after the input operation, which are unknown but must satisfy the given constraints.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
