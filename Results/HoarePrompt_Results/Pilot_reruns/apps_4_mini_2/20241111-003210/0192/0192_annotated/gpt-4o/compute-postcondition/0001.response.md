The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` is evaluated. Given that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), we can derive the following:

1. The difference `x - y` is a positive integer since \(y < x\).
2. The term `(x - y) // 2` calculates how many complete pairs can be made from the difference.
3. The term `(x - y) % 2` checks if there is an additional element left over after pairing.

Combining these two gives the total number of items when considering pairs and any leftover.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only state that the output will be an integer result based on the calculation from the expression. The output state does not change the values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the output of the expression is an integer based on the calculation**
