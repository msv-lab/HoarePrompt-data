To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to modify the side length of an equilateral triangle starting from length `x` to obtain a triangle of length `y`, while ensuring that it remains a non-degenerate triangle. The program should calculate the minimum number of seconds required for this operation.

### Given Program
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print(abs(x - y))
```

### Output Hints
The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from input, ensuring that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. The function does not return any value.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. The program directly computes the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it.
2. The absolute difference, `abs(x - y)`, does not take into account the necessary transitions to maintain the triangle's properties during the side reductions.

### Edge Cases
- According to the problem, during the transition from `x` to `y`, we must keep all sides of the triangle as integers and ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., all sides must be positive).
- The simple calculation of `abs(x - y)` fails to account for the necessary steps to ensure that the triangle remains valid at each transition. For example:
  - If `x = 8` and `y = 5`, the transition could be `(8, 8, 8) → (8, 8, 5) → (8, 5, 5) → (5, 5, 5)`, which requires 3 seconds, but the formula would return `3` correctly. However, the reasoning behind how to achieve this isn't validated in the code's structure.
  - Conversely, if `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the correct transitions are more complex than simply taking the difference, as it involves multiple steps decreasing each side while ensuring no side becomes zero.

### Analysis of Output Hints
The output hints suggest that the function simply prints the absolute difference, which does not reflect the number of seconds needed to perform each operation while maintaining a valid triangle. Therefore, while the output hints agree with the code's output, they do not align with the requirement to maintain valid triangle conditions through the transitions.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases, particularly in how it calculates the required time to modify the side lengths while keeping the triangle valid. The absolute difference does not capture the complexities involved in the transitions between triangle states. 

Correctness: **False**.
