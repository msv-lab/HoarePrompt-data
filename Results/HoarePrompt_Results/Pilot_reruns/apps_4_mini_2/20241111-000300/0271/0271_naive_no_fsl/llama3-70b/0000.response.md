Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to round the integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0 according to the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. If `n` is already a multiple of 10 (`n % 10 == 0`), it prints `n` as the output.
2. If the last digit of `n` is 0 through 5 (`n % 10 <= 5`), it rounds down to the nearest lower multiple of 10 by subtracting the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (`n - n % 10`).
3. If the last digit of `n` is 6 through 9, it rounds up to the nearest higher multiple of 10 by adding `(10 - n % 10)` to `n`.

The provided examples in the problem description are well handled by the program. For instance:
- For `n = 5`, it correctly outputs `0` (rounding down).
- For `n = 113`, it outputs `110`, which is the correct lower multiple of 10.
- For `n = 1000000000`, it outputs `1000000000`, correctly identifying it as already rounded.
- For `n = 5432359`, it outputs `5432360`, which is the correct rounding up.

Given the conditions and outputs described, the program functions as intended for all possible inputs within the specified range (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). 

Thus, there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, confirming its correctness.
