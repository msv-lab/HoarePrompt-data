The code prints the value of `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which calculates the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and the output does not change the state of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, and the next multiple of 10 computed is `n + (10 - n % 10)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and the next multiple of 10 computed is `n + (10 - n % 10)`**
