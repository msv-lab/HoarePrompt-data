The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is not specified, but it is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is assigned an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
