The function accepts an integer input `n`, and prints the nearest multiple of 10 based on the value of `n`. If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n` directly. If `n` ends in 0-5, it prints the nearest lower multiple of 10 (`n - n % 10`). If `n` ends in 6-9, it prints the next higher multiple of 10 (`n + (10 - n % 10)`). This covers all integer values of `n`, including negative numbers and zero. The function does not return any value, as it only prints the results.
