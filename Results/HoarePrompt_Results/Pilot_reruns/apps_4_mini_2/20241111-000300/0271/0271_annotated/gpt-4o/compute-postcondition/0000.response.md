The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` can take any non-negative integer value within the specified range of 0 to 10^9. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9**
