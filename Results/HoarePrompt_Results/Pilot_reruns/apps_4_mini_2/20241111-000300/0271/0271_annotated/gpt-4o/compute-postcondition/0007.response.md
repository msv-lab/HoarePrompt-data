Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for a non-negative integer `n`, and calculates the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`. If the last digit of `n` (the remainder when divided by 10) is less than or equal to 5, the function rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10; otherwise, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10. The result is then printed. This function does not handle invalid inputs (such as negative integers or non-integer inputs) and will raise an error if the input is not a valid integer. **
