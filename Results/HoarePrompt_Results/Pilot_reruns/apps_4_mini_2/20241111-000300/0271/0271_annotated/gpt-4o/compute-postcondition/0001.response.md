The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `remainder` will hold a value between 0 and 9, inclusive. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`**
