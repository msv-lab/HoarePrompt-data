The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`, which gives the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. The value of `result` is then assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. This calculation effectively rounds `n` up to the next multiple of 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`; `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`**
