The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate without any input. Given the constraints that `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, it is implied that the function may use a predefined value of `n` within this range, but since no parameters are explicitly passed to the function, we cannot specify how this value is utilized or what the output is based on it.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined without additional context on how `n` is determined or what the function is expected to return.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its functionality is undefined without additional context.**
