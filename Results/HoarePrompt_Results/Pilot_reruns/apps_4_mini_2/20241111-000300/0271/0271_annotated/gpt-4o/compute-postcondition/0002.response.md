The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. The value of `remainder` is `n % 10`, which is the last digit of `n`. Therefore, `result` will be equal to `n` minus its last digit. The other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the relationship among them.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`; `result` is `n - (n % 10)`**
