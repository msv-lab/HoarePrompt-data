Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. If `remainder` (which is `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, `result` is set to the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n` (i.e., `result` is `n - remainder`). If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is set to the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` (i.e., `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`). This ensures that `result` is the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`, rounding down if the remainder is 5 or lower, and rounding up if the remainder is greater than 5.***
