Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` ends in 5. According to the problem description, when `n = 5`, Vasya can round it to either `0` or `10`, both of which are valid. However, the current implementation always rounds to `0` when `n` is less than or equal to 5. This means it will incorrectly round `5` to `0`, which does not satisfy the requirement that both `0` and `10` are valid outputs. 

To illustrate:
- For input `5`, the expected outputs could be `0` or `10`. The program outputs `0`, which is acceptable, but it does not account for the alternative valid output of `10`. 
- For input `15`, the program would output `10`, which is correct, but it should also provide `20` as a valid option.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
