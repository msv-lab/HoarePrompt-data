The code executes a print statement which outputs the string `?`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the printed output is `?`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the printed output is `?`**
