The code snippet executes a print statement, which outputs a string to the console. The variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` retain their values after the execution since the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values of the variables.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the output is '-'**
