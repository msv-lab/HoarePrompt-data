Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100 inclusive. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is equal to 0, then '0' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 0, or if `x` is not equal to `y`, then '?' is printed. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged after execution.***
