Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
- We need to determine the voting result based on three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
- The results can be:
  - "+" if upvotes exceed downvotes.
  - "-" if downvotes exceed upvotes.
  - "0" if upvotes and downvotes are equal.
  - "?" if the outcome is uncertain due to unknown votes.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program implements the following logic:
1. If `x > y + z`, it prints '+' (indicating that even with all unknown votes being downvotes, upvotes exceed).
2. If `x < y`, it prints '-' (indicating that upvotes are fewer than downvotes).
3. If `x == y`:
   - If `z == 0`, it prints '0' (indicating a tie with no unknown votes).
   - If `z > 0`, it prints '?' (indicating uncertainty because unknown votes could tip the scale).
4. If none of these conditions are met, it prints '?'.

### Edge Case Consideration:
Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- If `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the result could be either '+' or '-' depending on the unknown vote. This case is handled correctly as it prints '?'.
- If `x = 1`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`, the result is clearly '+' and is handled correctly.
- If `x = 0`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`, the result is clearly '-' and is handled correctly.
- If `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`, the result is '0' and is handled correctly.

Now we also need to check against the output hints:
- The hints accurately describe the program's logic and the conditions it evaluates.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It handles all possible combinations of `x`, `y`, and `z`, including edge cases, and provides the correct output in each scenario.

**Correctness: True**.
