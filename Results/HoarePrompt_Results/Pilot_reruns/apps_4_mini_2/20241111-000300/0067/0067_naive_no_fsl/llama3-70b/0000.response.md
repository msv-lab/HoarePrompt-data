Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the result when `x + z < y`. In this case, there is uncertainty because, depending on how the unknown voters vote, the result could be either "-" or "0". 

For example, consider the input `x = 1`, `y = 3`, and `z = 1`. Here, there is one certain upvote, three certain downvotes, and one unknown vote. The possibilities for the unknown vote are:
- If the unknown voter upvotes, the result would be `1 (up) - 3 (down) = -2`, which means more downvotes.
- If the unknown voter downvotes, the result would be `1 (up) - 4 (down) = -3`, which also means more downvotes.

In both cases, the outcome is "-", but the logic to determine this in the program does not explicitly account for the scenario of `x + z < y`. The program would incorrectly return "?" in this scenario due to the current conditions.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the case where the result can be determined as certain when the number of known upvotes plus unknown votes is less than the number of downvotes.
