The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The values of `y` and `z` are based on user input, so the specific values are unknown but can be represented as integers. The other variables (`x`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
