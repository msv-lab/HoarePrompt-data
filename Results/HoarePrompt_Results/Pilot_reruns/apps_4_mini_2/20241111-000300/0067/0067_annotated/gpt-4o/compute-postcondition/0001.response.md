`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, where `x` is an integer based on user input. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`**
