The value of `max_upvotes` is assigned the result of `x + z`. The values of `x` and `z` are based on user input, so `max_upvotes` will be the sum of these input values. The variable `min_upvotes` remains equal to `x`, and the values of `y` and `z` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `max_upvotes` as well.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`**
