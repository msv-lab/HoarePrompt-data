The code executes a print statement which outputs the string `?`. It does not alter any of the variables, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
