To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code and compare its logic against the problem description and the provided examples.

### Problem Analysis
The problem describes a voting scenario where:
- `x`: Number of guaranteed upvotes.
- `y`: Number of guaranteed downvotes.
- `z`: Number of uncertain votes (which could be either upvotes or downvotes).

The expected outputs based on the conditions are:
1. If `x` > `y + z`, print "+" (more upvotes than possible downvotes).
2. If `x` < `y`, print "-" (more definite downvotes).
3. If `x` == `y`, then:
   - If `z` == 0, print "0" (exact tie).
   - If `z` > 0, print "?" (uncertain result).
4. If `x` > `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, print "?".

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    
    if (x > y + z):
        print('+')
    else:
        if (x < y):
            print('-')
        else:
            if (x == y):
                if (z == 0):
                    print('0')
                else:
                    print('?')
            else:
                print('?')
```

### Logical Flow
1. The first condition checks if `x` is greater than `y + z`. If true, it prints "+".
2. If false, it checks if `x` is less than `y` and prints "-" if true.
3. If `x` is equal to `y`, it further checks:
   - If `z` is zero, it prints "0".
   - If `z` is greater than zero, it prints "?".
4. Finally, if `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, it defaults to printing "?".

### Edge Case Analysis
To verify the correctness, we need to check various scenarios:
1. **Case where `x > y + z`**:
   - Example: `x = 3`, `y = 2`, `z = 0` should return "+".
2. **Case where `x < y`**:
   - Example: `x = 2`, `y = 3`, `z = 0` should return "-".
3. **Case where `x == y` and `z == 0`**:
   - Example: `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 0` should return "0".
4. **Case where `x == y` and `z > 0`**:
   - Example: `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 1` should return "?".
5. **Case where `x > y` but `x <= y + z`**:
   - Example: `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `z = 1` should return "?".
6. **Case where all are zero**:
   - Example: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1` should return "?".

### Conclusion
The code handles the primary cases correctly based on the problem description. However, there is a flaw in the handling of the `x > y` but `x <= y + z` condition, which should also return "?" as stated in the problem description. This is compliant with the example `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`, which should return "?".

The annotations also support this conclusion, as they outline the expected behavior for various conditions.

Thus, there is a case where the program does not correctly handle the uncertainty, particularly when `x` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `y + z`.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to return the expected "?" in scenarios where `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, which makes it inconsistent with the problem description.
