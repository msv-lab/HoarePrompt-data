The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `chars` in this specific case. The value of `chars` is a string of digits with a length of at least 1, but its specific content is not known. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `chars`**
