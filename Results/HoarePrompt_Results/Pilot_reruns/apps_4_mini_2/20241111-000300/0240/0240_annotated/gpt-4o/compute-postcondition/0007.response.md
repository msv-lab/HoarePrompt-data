Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the second permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, the function does not yield anything.***
