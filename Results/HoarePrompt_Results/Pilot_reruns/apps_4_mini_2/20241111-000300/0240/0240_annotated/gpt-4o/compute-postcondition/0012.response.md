According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of the `chars` string. The loop will iterate through all permutations of `chars`, and the variable `perm` will take on each permutation one at a time.

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is the third permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to move to the next permutation in the sequence. 

Since `candidate` is the third permutation, the next permutation will be the fourth one. Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `perm` reflects this next permutation.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the `chars` string remains unchanged and does not affect the ability to generate additional permutations.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `candidate` is the fourth permutation of `chars` as a string.**
