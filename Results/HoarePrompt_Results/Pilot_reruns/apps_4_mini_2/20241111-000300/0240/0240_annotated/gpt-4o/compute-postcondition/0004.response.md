According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of the string `chars`. The loop iterates over each permutation of `chars`, and since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `perm` is currently set to the first permutation of `chars`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next permutation. Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, the next permutation will be the second in the sequence of permutations. Therefore, `perm` needs to be updated to the second permutation of `chars`. 

Also, since `candidate` is equal to `chars`, and permutations generate all possible arrangements, `candidate` does not need to change because it is derived from `chars`, which remains the same.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration of the loop:
State: **`chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `chars`.**
