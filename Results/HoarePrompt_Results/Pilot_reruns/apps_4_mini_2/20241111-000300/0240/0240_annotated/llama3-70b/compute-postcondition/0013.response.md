The code `n += t` appends the value of `t` to the current value of `n`. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is a string composed of characters from `s` that are also present in `t_set`, the value of `n` can be either empty or a string of those characters. The variable `t` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of an unknown value `t` to the current value of `n`, which is either a string or empty.

Output State: **`n` is a string composed of all characters from `s` that are also present in `t_set`, and `n` is updated by appending the value of `t`**
