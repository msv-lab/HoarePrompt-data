The code creates a set `t_set` from the substring `t`. This means that `t_set` will contain the unique characters (digits) found in `t`. The initial state of `s` and `t` is not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t_set` now holds the unique digits from `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length up to 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`; `t_set` contains the unique digits from `t**.
