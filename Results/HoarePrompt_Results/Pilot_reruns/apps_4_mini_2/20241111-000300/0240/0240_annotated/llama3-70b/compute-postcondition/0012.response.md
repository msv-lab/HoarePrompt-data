Output State: **`n` is a string composed of all characters from `s` that are also present in `t_set`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If `t_set` is empty, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If `s` has no characters that are in `t_set`, `n` remains an empty string. `c` iterates through each character in `s`.**
