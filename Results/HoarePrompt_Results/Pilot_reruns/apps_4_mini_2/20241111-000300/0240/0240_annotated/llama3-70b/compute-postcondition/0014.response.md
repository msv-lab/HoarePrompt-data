The function returns `int(n)`, where `n` is a string composed of all characters from `s` that are also present in `t_set`, and has been updated by appending the value of `t`. The value of `n` is now a string that can be converted to an integer. The output state does not change any variables, but indicates that `n` is converted to an integer.

Output State: **`n` is a string composed of all characters from `s` that are also present in `t_set` and has been updated by appending the value of `t`, and the function returns `int(n)`**
