To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we consider the following aspects:

1. The loop iterates over the permutations of `chars`. After the last iteration, `perm` is currently set to the second permutation of `chars`.
2. To continue iterating, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence of permutations generated by the `permutations(chars)` function.
3. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the characters in `chars`. If `chars` consists of a non-empty string of digits, there are multiple permutations available.
4. The previous state mentions that `candidate` is the same as `perm`, which implies that the next `perm` will be the third permutation of `chars`.

Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `perm` refers to the next permutation after the second one, which is the third permutation. The `candidate` will also be updated to match the new `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`.**
