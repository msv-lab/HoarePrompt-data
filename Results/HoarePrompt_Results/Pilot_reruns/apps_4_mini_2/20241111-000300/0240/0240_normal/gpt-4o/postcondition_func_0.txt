The function accepts a string of digits `s` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after subtracting the characters in `sub`. Then, it generates possible numbers from these remaining characters and returns the smallest number that can be formed. If `s` does not contain enough characters to account for those in `sub`, this could lead to unexpected behavior, depending on the implementation of `generate_possible_numbers`.
