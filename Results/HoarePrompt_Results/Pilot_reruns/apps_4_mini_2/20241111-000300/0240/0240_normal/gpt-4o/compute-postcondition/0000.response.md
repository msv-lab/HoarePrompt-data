According to the code, the loop is trying to generate permutations of the string `chars`. For the `permutations` function to execute, `chars` must not be empty; however, it has been stated that `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, which implies it could be empty if the length is 0 (though this is not explicitly stated). 

Assuming `chars` contains at least one digit, the loop will execute and the `perm` variable will hold each permutation of the digits in `chars`. 

At the start of the first iteration, `perm` will be the first permutation of `chars`. However, since there are no further specifications about the initial state of `perm`, it should just be set for the first iteration.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we can state that `chars` is a non-empty string of digits and `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
