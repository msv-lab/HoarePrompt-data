The code `yield candidate` is a generator statement that yields the current value of `candidate`. The variables `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` are not modified by this statement. `candidate` holds the same value as `perm`, which is the second permutation of `chars`. The yield statement will output this value without changing the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
