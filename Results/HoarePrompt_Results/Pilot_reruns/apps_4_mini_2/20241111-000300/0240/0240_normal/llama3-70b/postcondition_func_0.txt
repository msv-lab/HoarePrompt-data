The function accepts a string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty string `t` also consisting of digits. It constructs a new string `n` by collecting characters from `s` that are present in `t`, and then appends the entire string `t` to this collection. Finally, it returns the integer representation of the final string `n`. If no characters from `s` are found in `t`, `n` will only consist of the characters from `t`, which might lead to returning an integer formed solely from `t`. The function may also return 0 if both `s` is empty and `t` contains only non-numeric characters or is not properly formed as digits.
