Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` contains unique digits from `t`, `n` is an empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to include `c`, which means `n` will be equal to `c` (the first character of `s`). If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains an empty string.***
