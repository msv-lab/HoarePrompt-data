The function accepts no parameters and reads a string `s` from user input, which must consist of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive. It checks if `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If `s` is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. There are no return statements, and the function does not handle cases where `s` is empty or contains non-letter characters, as it assumes valid input based on the constraints.
