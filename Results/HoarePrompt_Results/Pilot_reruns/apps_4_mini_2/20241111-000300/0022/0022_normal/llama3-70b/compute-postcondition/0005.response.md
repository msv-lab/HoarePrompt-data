The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or any surrounding structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `is_spalindrome` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
