Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the current loop or statement. If the characters are equal, `is_palindrome` remains unchanged, and the program continues to check further conditions.***
