The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not change the values of the other variables, which remain as they were. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
