Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the "s-palindrome" checking as defined in the problem description. The problem states that a string is "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle, with the specific requirement that for a string like "aa", it must not be considered an "s-palindrome" because the second half is not the mirror reflection of the first half.

The code checks if the string is a standard palindrome by comparing characters from the start and the end moving towards the middle. However, it does not account for the requirement of "mirror reflection". For instance, in the case of the string "aa", the current implementation would return `True` because it treats it as a palindrome, but according to the problem definition, it should return `NIE`.

The annotations describe the functionality as checking for palindromic properties but fail to recognize the specific definition of "s-palindrome" that includes the reflection requirement. Thus, the code does not satisfy the problem description for cases like "aa" or any other string where mirrored symmetry is not achieved.

Therefore, since there are valid inputs for which the code does not produce the correct output according to the problem description, the overall correctness of the code is False.
