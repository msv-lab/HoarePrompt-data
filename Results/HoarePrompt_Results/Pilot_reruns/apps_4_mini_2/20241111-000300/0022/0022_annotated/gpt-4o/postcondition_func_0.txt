The function accepts a string `s` of length between 1 and 1000 and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward as forward. If `s` has only one character, it is considered a palindrome and the function returns `True`. However, if `s` has two or more characters, it checks pairs of characters from the beginning and end of the string. If any pair does not match, it returns `False`. If all pairs match, it returns `True`. The function does not handle cases where `s` is empty, as it assumes `s` will always have at least one character.
