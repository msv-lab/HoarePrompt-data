The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are `s` (a string of length between 1 and 1000), `n` (at least 2), `is_palindrome` (True), and `i` (1). The assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
