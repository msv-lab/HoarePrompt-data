Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `is_palindrome` is True. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not equal the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If the characters are equal, the program continues to check the next characters, maintaining `is_spalindrome` as True unless a mismatch is found.***
