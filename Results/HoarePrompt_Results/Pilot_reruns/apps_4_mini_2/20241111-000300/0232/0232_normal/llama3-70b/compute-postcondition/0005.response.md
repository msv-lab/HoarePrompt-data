`color_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `color` is the first integer in the `colors` list, and `color_counts` is a dictionary that will now have an entry with the key `color` set to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first integer in the list, and `color_counts[color]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first integer in the list, and `color_counts[color]` is set to 0**
