The line of code initializes `current_counts` as a `defaultdict` of integers. This means that `current_counts` will automatically create a default value of `0` for any key that does not already exist in the dictionary. Since the initial values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`) are not affected by this line, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the initialization of `current_counts` while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers where the sum of k's elements (k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m) is at least 1 and at most n; `desired_counts` is a dictionary created from zipping range(1, m + 1) with k; `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int)**
