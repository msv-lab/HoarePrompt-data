Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of `k`'s elements is at least 1 and at most `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary created from zipping range(1, m + 1) with `k`, and `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int) with increased count for `colors[right]`. If all counts in `current_counts` match the respective counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the desired distribution of colors has been achieved. If there are any discrepancies in the counts, the function does not return a value (or implicitly returns None).***
