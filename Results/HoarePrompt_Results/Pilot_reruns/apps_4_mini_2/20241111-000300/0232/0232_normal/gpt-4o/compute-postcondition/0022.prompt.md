You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), colors is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and k is a list of m integers where the sum of k's elements (k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m) is at least 1 and at most n.
```
def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
```
Output: Case_1: `current_counts` reflects the number of occurrences of each color from the `colors` list up to index `right`, where `right` ranges from 0 to n-1. If at any point `current_counts` matches `desired_counts` exactly, the function returns 'YES'. If the loop ends due to `all(current_counts[color] >= desired_counts[color] for color in desired_counts)` failing, `left` is incremented by the number of times the inner loop executed, and `current_counts` reflects the decremented counts for `colors[left]`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `current_counts` remains unchanged while `left` and `right` are both 0. If `desired_counts` cannot be satisfied with the available colors in `colors`, the loop may also exit without finding a valid combination, leaving `current_counts` as it was before the loop started.

Case_2: `current_counts` remains unchanged, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the function returns 'NO'

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
