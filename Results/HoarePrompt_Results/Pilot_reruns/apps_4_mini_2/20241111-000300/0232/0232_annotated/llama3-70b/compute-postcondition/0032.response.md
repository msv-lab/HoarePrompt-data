Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. Additionally, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, it remains unchanged.***
