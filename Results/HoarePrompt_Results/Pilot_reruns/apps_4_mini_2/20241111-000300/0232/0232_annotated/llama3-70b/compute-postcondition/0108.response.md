Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `window_counts` and `found` unchanged. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining empty and `found` unchanged. If `colors` does not contain any colors from `counts`, then `found` will also remain unchanged regardless of the loop execution.***
