Postcondition: ***`window_counts` has been updated for `color`, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If they match, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues execution without breaking. The variables `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, with `j` equal to `i` and `color` assigned the value from `colors[j]`.***
