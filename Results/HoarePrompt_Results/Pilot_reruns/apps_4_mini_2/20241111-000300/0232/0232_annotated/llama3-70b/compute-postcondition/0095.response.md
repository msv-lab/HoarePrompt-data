The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` has been updated for `color`, `found` is set to True, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
