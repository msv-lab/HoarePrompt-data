Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first element in the colors list, `counts` is a list of integers derived from input, and `color_counts` is a dictionary that contains `color` as a key with a value of 0 if `color` was not previously present in the dictionary. If `color` was already in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
