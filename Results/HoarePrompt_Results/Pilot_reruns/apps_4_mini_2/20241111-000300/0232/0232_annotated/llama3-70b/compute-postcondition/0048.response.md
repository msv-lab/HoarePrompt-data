Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop terminates early, meaning `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` remains False, and both `i` and `j` are unchanged. If `n` is greater than 0 and the loop has executed, `j` has been incremented from `i` to `n-1`, updating `window_counts` with each encountered color in `colors`, and setting `found` to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If `n` is 0 or `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining empty, `found` remaining False, and both `i` and `j` unchanged.***
