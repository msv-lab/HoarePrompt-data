The variable `counts` is assigned a list of integers derived from the input, which are converted from a space-separated string of numbers into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial states of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the variable `colors` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new list assigned to `counts`, while `n`, `m`, and `colors` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers derived from input; `counts` is a list of integers derived from input.**
