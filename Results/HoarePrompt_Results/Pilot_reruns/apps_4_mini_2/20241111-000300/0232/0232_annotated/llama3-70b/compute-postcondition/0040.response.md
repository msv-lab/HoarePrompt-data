Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
