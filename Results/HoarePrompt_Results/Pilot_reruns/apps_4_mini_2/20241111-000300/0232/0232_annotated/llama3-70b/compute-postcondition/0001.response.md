The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. The input consists of space-separated integers, and since `n` is an input integer constrained to be between 1 and 100, and `m` is also an input integer constrained to be between 1 and `n`, the `colors` list will contain integers that are within the range of valid input values as specified.

The output state will reflect that `colors` is a list of integers derived from user input. The previous values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers derived from input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers derived from input.**
