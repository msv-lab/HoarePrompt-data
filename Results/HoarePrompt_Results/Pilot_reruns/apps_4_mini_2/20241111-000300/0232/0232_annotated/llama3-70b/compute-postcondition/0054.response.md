Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is an empty dictionary initially. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` will contain one entry with `color` as the key and 0 as its value. The variable `found` remains False, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` is greater than `i`. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, there are no changes made to `window_counts`, `found`, `i`, `j`, or `n`.***
