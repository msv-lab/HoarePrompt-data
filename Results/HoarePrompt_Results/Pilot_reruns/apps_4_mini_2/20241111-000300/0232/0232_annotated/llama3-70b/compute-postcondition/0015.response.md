Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in the colors list, `counts` is a list of integers derived from input, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 (or remains unchanged if `color` was already a key in `color_counts`).**
