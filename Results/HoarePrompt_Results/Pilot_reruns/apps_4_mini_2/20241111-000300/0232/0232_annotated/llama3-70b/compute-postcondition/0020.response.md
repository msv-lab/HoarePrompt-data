The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. The other variables `color_counts`, `found`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged in their states. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
