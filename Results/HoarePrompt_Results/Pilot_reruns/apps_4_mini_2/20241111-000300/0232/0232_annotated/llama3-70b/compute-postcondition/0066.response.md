Postcondition: ***`window_counts` includes `color` with a count of 1; `found` is set to True; `i` remains unchanged; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, leading to the break from the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, the values of `window_counts`, `found`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `color` remain unchanged.***
