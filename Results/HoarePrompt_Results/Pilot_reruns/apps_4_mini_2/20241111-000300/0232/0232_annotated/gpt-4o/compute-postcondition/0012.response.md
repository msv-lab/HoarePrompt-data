Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color such that 1 ≤ ∑ `k[i]` ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, and `current_counts` is adjusted so that at least one `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]`. If all values in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts` for each color, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything, indicating that the counts do not fully meet the desired criteria.***
