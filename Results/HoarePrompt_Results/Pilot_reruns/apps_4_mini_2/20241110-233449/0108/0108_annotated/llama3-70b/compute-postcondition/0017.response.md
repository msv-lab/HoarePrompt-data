According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The loop can execute again as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the next character in the alphabet, which means it is not guaranteed that `char` will still be in `s`, unless `s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' or the specific next character.

Since `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z' and `char` has already been replaced by the next character in the alphabet, we need to ensure that `char` is indeed one of the characters present in `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `char` should be the character just before the one currently in `s`.

State: **`s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is 'a' repeated plus the previous character before `char`, and `char` is the character before the current one in the alphabet**
