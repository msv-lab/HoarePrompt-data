The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. The initial states indicate that `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last processed character, and `res` contains 'a' repeated for each character replaced. Thus, after executing the code, `res` will have one additional character, which is `char`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is 'a' repeated plus the next character `char`, `char` is the next character in the alphabet.

Output State: **`s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is 'a' repeated plus `char`, `char` is the next character in the alphabet**
