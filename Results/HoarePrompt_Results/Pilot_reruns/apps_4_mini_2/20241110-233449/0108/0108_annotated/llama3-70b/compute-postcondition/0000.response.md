The variable `s` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters. Since the new value of `s` will depend on the input provided, it will replace the previous value of `s`. Therefore, the output state is that `s` is now the input string.

Output State: **`s` is the input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters**
