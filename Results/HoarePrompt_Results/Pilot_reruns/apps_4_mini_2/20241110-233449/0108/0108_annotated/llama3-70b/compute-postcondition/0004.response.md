The code appends `char` to `res`. Since `char` is 'a', the value of `res` will be updated to 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is the input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
