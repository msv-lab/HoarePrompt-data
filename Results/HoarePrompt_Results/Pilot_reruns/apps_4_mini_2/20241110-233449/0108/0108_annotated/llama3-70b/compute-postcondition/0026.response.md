The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. Since `char` is 'd', the new value of `res` will be `res + 'd'`. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`s` contains processed characters, `res` contains the sequence of characters added during the loop execution plus 'd', `char` is 'd'**
