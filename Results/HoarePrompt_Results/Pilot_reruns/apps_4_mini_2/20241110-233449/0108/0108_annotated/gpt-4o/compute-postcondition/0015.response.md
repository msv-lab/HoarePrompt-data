To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition: `i < len(s) and j < target_len`. 

1. The variable `i` is currently 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `s` is a string with a length between 1 and 100,000, `len(s)` is at least 1. Therefore, as long as `len(s)` is greater than 3, the condition for `i` will hold true.
  
2. The variable `j` is stated to be less than 26. The condition for `j` to allow another iteration is that it must be less than `target_len`, which is 26. Since `j` is already less than 26, this condition holds true.

Given that both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied, the loop can execute one more time without needing any adjustments. 

Thus, we do not need to make any modifications to the provided state.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; and `j` is less than 26**
