The function accepts a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It checks if `s` contains all the letters of the English alphabet in order. If it does, it prints the entire alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` is empty or does not contain the complete alphabet in order, the function will also print -1.
