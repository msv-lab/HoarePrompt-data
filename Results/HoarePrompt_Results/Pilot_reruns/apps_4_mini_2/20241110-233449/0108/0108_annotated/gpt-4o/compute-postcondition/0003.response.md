In the provided code snippet, the variables `i` and `j` are initialized to `0`. The initial values of `s`, `target`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is simply the values of the initialized variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
