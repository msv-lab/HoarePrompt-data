Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; if the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, indicating that the current character of `target` has been found in `s`. If `s[i]` does not match `target[j]`, `j` remains unchanged.***
