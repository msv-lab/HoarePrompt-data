Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all letters of the alphabet in order, then `j` is 26 and `i` is the length of `s`, resulting in the function printing `target`. If `s` contains fewer than 26 letters or does not contain the entire alphabet, then `j` is less than 26 and `i` is the length of `s` or less, leading the function to print -1. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `i` and `j` remain 0, resulting in the function also printing -1.***
