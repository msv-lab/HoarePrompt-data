Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length that can be at least 26. If `j` equals `target_len`, the function prints `target`, indicating that all characters matched. If `j` is not equal to `target_len`, and if `len(s)` is at least 26, then `i` is at most `len(s)` and `j` represents the number of matching characters found in `target`, and the function prints -1. If `len(s)` is less than 26, then the loop may not execute, resulting in `i` remaining 0 and `j` remaining 0, and the function also prints -1.***
