According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has been modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character, which means that `s` no longer contains the original `char`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain `char`. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the modification, `s` still has at least one occurrence of `char`. This means that the first occurrence of `char` in `s` must have been followed by another occurrence of `char` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`**
