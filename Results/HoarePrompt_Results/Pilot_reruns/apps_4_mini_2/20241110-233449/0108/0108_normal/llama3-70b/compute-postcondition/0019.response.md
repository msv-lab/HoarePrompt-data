The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that is one position after `char` in the ASCII table. Here, `char` is 'b', and its ASCII value is 98. The next character, which is obtained by `chr(ord(char) + 1)`, is 'c'. The initial string `s` is 'abc', which contains 'b'. 

After the execution of the code:
- The first occurrence of 'b' in 'abc' is replaced by 'c', resulting in `s` becoming 'acc'.

The variable `res` remains unchanged as 'abb'.

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 'abb', `s` is 'acc', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`res` is 'abb', `s` is 'acc', `char` is 'b'**
