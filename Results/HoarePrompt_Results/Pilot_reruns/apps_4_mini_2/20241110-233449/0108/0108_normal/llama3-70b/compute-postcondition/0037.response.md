Output State: **`res` is a string formed by concatenating each character from `s` for every occurrence of that character until it is no longer present, with characters being replaced by their next ASCII character in `s`. If `s` does not contain any characters from `alphabet`, the loop will not execute, and both `res` and `s` will remain unchanged. If `s` contains characters that are not in the alphabet, they will be unaffected, and the loop will only process characters from 'a' to 'z' present in `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string.**
