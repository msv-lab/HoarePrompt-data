Output State: **`if 'a' is in s then res` is 'a' and `s` has the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `char` is 'a'. If 'b' is in s then the loop will execute again, `res` remains unchanged, `s` has the first occurrence of 'b' replaced by 'c', `char` is 'b'. This continues until `char` is 'z'. If `char` reaches 'z' and 'z' is in s, `res` remains unchanged but `s` will have 'z' replaced by '{' (ASCII value of 'z' + 1). If `s` does not contain 'a', the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string.`**
