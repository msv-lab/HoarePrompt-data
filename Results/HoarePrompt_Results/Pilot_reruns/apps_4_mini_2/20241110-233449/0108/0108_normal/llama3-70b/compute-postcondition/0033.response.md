The string `s` undergoes a replacement operation where the first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced by the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. The variable `res` is not directly altered by this operation, but it was previously incremented by `char`. Therefore, the output state reflects the modified string `s` and the unchanged state of `res`.

Output State: **`s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character, `res` is incremented by `char`**
