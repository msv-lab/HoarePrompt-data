According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the contents of `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `s` includes 'c', which means `char` must be 'c' for the loop to execute one more time. Since `res` is unchanged, it does not affect the loop's ability to execute. 

For the loop to run one more time, it is required that `char` be equal to 'c'. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` includes 'c', `res` is unchanged, and `char` is 'c'**
