The variable `s` has the first occurrence of 'b' replaced by 'c'. The initial state indicates that `s` has 'b' replaced by 'c', so `s` becomes 'ac'. The value of `res` remains unchanged as 'ab', and `char` is still 'b'. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 'ab', `s` is 'ac', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`res` is 'ab', `s` is 'ac', `char` is 'b'**
