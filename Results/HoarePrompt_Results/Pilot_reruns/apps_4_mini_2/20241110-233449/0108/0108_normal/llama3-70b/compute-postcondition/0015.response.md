The code appends `char` to `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` is 'a', and `char` is 'b'. Therefore, after executing `res += char`, `res` will become 'ab'. The state of `s` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`res` is 'ab', `s` has the first occurrence of 'b' replaced by 'c', `char` is 'b'**
