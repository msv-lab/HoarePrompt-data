The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that follows it in the ASCII table. The initial state indicates that `s` includes 'a', and `char` is not explicitly defined, but we can infer that it must be 'a' for the replacement to occur. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so `chr(ord(char) + 1)` would result in 'b'. 

Thus, `s` will be modified from including 'a' to including 'b' after the replacement. The value of `res` is not affected by this specific operation as it is mentioned only that it is incremented by appending `char`, but we don't have information about its current value or the actual appending operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is updated to include 'b', and `res` remains unchanged in value.

Output State: **`s` includes 'b', `res` is unchanged**
