The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `char`. The initial state indicates that `s` contains `char`, but the initial value of `res` is not provided. We can only state that `res` will now include the value of `char` added to it. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change without specifying the exact value of `res`.

Output State: **`s` contains `char`, `res` is incremented by `char`**
