Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The main issue is that it checks if the string `s` contains the necessary characters for the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", but it does not consider the replacement of characters to ensure that it can actually form the required subsequence.

For example, consider the input string `s = "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"`. This string contains all the letters of the alphabet in reverse order. The program will output `-1` because it does not find "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" as a subsequence in the correct order, even though it could replace characters to transform it into that sequence.

Another example is `s = "aabbccddeeffgg"`. The program would output `-1` because it does not check whether it can replace characters to form the subsequence. 

In both cases, it is possible to transform the input string into a string that contains the alphabet as a subsequence, but the program fails to recognize that due to its flawed logic. 

Thus, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, it is deemed incorrect.
