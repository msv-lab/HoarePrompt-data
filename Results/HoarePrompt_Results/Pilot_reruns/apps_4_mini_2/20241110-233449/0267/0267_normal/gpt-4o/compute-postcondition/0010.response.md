According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. Given that `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r - 1`, and `r` is at least `l + 1`, we need to determine if the loop can execute one more time based on the current value of `num`.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` would be equal to `r`, since the loop iterates from `l` to `r + 1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be `r + 1`, but since the loop's range goes up to `r + 1`, it means the loop has just finished its last iteration at `num = r`.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `r` such that the loop can run from `l` to the new `r + 1` (which would be `r + 1 + 1 = r + 2`). 

Therefore, we need to update `r` to be at least `l + 2` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r - 1` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, and `total_sum` remains 0 initially.**
