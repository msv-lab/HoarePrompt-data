According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The range function will create an iterable starting from `l` and ending at `r` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Given that the initial conditions state that `1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18`, this condition is already satisfied.

At the beginning of the loop, `num` will take its initial value from `l`. Since `total_sum` is initialized to 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop but is relevant for any calculations within the loop body.

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly with the provided state, we need to confirm that `num` starts at `l`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
