The function returns `total_sum`, which is the calculated sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` inclusive that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`. The exact value of `total_sum` is not specified in the initial state, but it can be 0 if the loop does not execute (when `l` is greater than `r`) or if `func_1(num, k)` returns false for all numbers in the range. Since no specific value for `total_sum` is provided, we conclude that it is the result of the operations prior to the return statement.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `total_sum` is returned, but its exact value is unknown.

Output State: **`total_sum` is returned**
