The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (where 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18) and an integer `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). It calculates the sum of all integers in the range from `l` to `r` inclusive for which a condition determined by `func_1(num, k)` is true, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`. If there are no integers in the range that satisfy the condition, or if `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0.
