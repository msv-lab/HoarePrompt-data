The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. Given that `total_sum` is initially 0 and `num` is equal to `l`, the calculation becomes `total_sum = (0 + l) % MOD`, resulting in `total_sum` being equal to `l % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`**
