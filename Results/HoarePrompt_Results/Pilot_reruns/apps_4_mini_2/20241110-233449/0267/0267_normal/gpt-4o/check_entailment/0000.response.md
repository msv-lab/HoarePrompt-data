To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and print this sum modulo `998244353`. 

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**: 
   - This function checks if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`. It converts `n` to a string, creates a set of its characters (digits), and compares the length of this set to `k`.
   - This logic seems correct and adheres to the requirement of the problem.

2. **Function `func_2(l, r, k)`**: 
   - This function initializes `total_sum` to 0 and iterates through each number from `l` to `r`.
   - For each number, it checks if the number satisfies the condition defined in `func_1` (i.e., if it has at most `k` different digits).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it adds the number to `total_sum` and takes modulo `MOD` (which is defined as `998244353`).
   - Finally, it returns `total_sum`.

### Output Description
- The output description confirms that the function implements the logic to sum numbers between `l` and `r` that meet the digit uniqueness condition.

### Edge Cases
1. **Performance Concern**: The range for `l` and `r` can be very large (up to `10^18`). The current implementation iterates through every single number in that range, which is not computationally feasible. For instance, if `l = 1` and `r = 10^18`, the loop would run `10^18` times, which is impractical.
2. **Boundary Cases**: If `l` is equal to `r`, the code should correctly handle that case, which it does since `num` will only iterate once.
3. **No Valid Numbers**: If there are no numbers in the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition, the function will return `0`. This is a valid case according to the description.

### Conclusion
While the logic in both functions appears to be correct according to the problem description and output hints, the method used in `func_2` is not feasible for the input constraints due to the potential size of the range being iterated over. Thus, it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program may fail to execute in a reasonable time for large ranges due to its linear iteration approach, which is not suitable given the constraints.
