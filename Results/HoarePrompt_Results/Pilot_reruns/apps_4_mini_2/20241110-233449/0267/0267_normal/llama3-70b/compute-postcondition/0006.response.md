According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` in the range from 1 to `k - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 1. Given that the function returns 9 and that the tuple `(n, k)` exists in the dictionary `dp`, we can conclude that `k` must indeed be at least 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` will equal `k - 1`. Thus, we need to set `i` to 1 at the start of the loop. 

So, the adjustments needed are:
- `k` should be greater than 1 (i.e., `k` is at least 2).
- `i` is initialized to 1 before the loop starts.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the function returns 9 since the tuple `(n, k)` exists in the dictionary `dp`.**
