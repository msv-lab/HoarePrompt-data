The variable `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. Given that `i` is 1, this simplifies to `9 * 10 ** (1 - 1) * (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (1 - 1))`, which further reduces to `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`. The previous state of `dp[n, k]` is incremented by this computed value. The variables `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`**.
