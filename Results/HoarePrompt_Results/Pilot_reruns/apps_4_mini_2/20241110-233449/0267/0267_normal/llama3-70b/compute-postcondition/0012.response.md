According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `1` to `k - 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted so that `k` is greater than 4 (since `i` needs to be less than `k - 1`, which means `k` must be at least 5). 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` must be greater than 4,
- `i` needs to be incremented to 4.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is greater than 4; `i` is 4; `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 100 * (10`**
