Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is between 1 and 10, and if the tuple `(n, k)` exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns `dp[n, k]`. If `(n, k)` is not in `dp`, the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged and the function does not return anything.***
