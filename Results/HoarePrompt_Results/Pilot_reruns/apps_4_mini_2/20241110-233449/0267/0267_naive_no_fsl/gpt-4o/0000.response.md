Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints of the problem, specifically for the range of numbers up to \(10^{18}\).

1. The function `func_2` iterates over each number from `l` to `r` using a `for` loop. However, given that \(r\) can be as large as \(10^{18}\), this approach is infeasible because it will take an impractical amount of time to iterate through such a large range.

2. For example, if we take the input \(l = 1\), \(r = 10^{18}\), and \(k = 10\), the program would attempt to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to \(10^{18}\). This is not possible within a reasonable timeframe due to the sheer number of iterations required.

3. Additionally, the program doesn't account for the fact that the sum of a continuous range of integers can be calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\). This method could be utilized alongside the digit constraint check to improve efficiency.

Thus, there are potential cases where the program will either not complete in a reasonable time or not work at all for large ranges, confirming that the implementation is incorrect.
