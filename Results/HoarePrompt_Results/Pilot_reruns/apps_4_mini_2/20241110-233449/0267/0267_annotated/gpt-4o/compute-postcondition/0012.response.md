The function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that satisfy `func_1(num, k)`. Since `total_sum` is already described as the result of applying the function, if no integers satisfy the condition or if the loop does not execute (when `l` is greater than `r`), `total_sum` would remain 0. Therefore, the output state indicates the value of `total_sum` and notes that it is being returned.

Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, and the function returns `total_sum`**.
