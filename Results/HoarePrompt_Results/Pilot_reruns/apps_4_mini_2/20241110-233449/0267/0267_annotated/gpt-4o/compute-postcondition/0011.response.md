Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, where `num` ranges from `l` to `r`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false for all values of `num`, `total_sum` remains 0.**
