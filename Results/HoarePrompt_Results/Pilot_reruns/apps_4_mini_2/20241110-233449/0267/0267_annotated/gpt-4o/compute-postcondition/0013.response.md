The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Here, `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The function calculates `total_sum`, which is the sum of all integers in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy a condition defined by another function `func_1(num, k)`. After executing the function body, it returns `total_sum`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` defining a range, and an integer `k`, and return the sum of all integers within that range that meet a specific criterion defined by `func_1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l and r defining a range of integers, and k, and returns the sum of all integers from l to r that satisfy the condition defined by func_1(num, k).**
