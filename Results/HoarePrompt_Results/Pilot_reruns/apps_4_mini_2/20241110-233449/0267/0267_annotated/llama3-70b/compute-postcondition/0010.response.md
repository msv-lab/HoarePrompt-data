According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is 2. Since `i` is not less than `k`, the loop will not execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 1. The values of `l`, `r`, and `dp[n, k]` do not need to be modified as they are not influenced by the loop's execution condition.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is -720, `i` is 1**
