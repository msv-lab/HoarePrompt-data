The return statement returns `0`, and the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged. Since `l` and `r` are integers within the specified range, and `k` is also an integer within its range, the output state reflects their initial values along with the returned value.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and the function returns 0**
