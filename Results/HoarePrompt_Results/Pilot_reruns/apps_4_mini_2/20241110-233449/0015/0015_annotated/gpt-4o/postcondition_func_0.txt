The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input and checks several conditions: if `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is zero, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not zero, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is a non-negative multiple of `c`. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid or non-integer.
