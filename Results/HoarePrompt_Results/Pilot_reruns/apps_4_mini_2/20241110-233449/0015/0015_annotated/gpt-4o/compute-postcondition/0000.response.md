The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be reassigned based on the input provided by the user. The function `map(int, input().split())` will take a single line of input, split it into separate strings, convert those strings into integers, and assign them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. Since the exact input values are not provided, we cannot specify the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values of three integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers from input**
