Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not 0 and `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a non-negative multiple of `c`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not a multiple of `c` or it is negative. The edge case where `c` is zero is explicitly handled by printing 'NO' without a division error.***
