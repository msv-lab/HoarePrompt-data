The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are only assigned values from input and are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state includes the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the print output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers from input, and the output is 'YES'**.
