Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If `c` is zero, it checks if `a` equals `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, or 'NO' if they are not. If `c` is non-zero, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is a multiple of `c` and whether that division is non-negative; it prints 'YES' if both conditions are satisfied, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any values, only prints results based on the conditions evaluated. **
