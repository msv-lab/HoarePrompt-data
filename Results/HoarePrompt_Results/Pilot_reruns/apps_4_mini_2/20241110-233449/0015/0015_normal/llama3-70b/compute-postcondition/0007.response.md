Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values based on user input. If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the output is 'YES'; if `a` is not equal to `b`, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not 0 and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with a non-negative quotient, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This covers all edge cases, including scenarios where `c` is greater than, equal to, or less than 0, and where `b` is less than, equal to, or greater than `a`.***
