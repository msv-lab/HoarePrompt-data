Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values based on user input. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the program outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, the program outputs 'NO'. This includes cases where `c` is greater than 0, equal to 0 (which would raise an error), or negative, along with the conditions where `b` is less than, equal to, or greater than `a` to ensure all edge cases are covered.***
