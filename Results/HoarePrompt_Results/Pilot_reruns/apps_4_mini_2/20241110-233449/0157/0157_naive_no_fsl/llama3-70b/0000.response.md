To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The program is designed to calculate the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make compote in the ratio of 1:2:4. The key points from the description and the examples are:

1. For each lemon, exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears are needed.
2. The program calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used, based on the available quantities of lemons, apples, and pears.
3. The output is the total number of fruits used in those complete sets.

Let's break down the program:

- `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`:
  - This calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits. It finds the limiting factor by taking the smallest value among:
    - The number of lemons `a`.
    - The number of complete pairs of apples that can be formed from `b` (hence `b // 2`).
    - The number of complete sets of pears that can be formed from `c` (hence `c // 4`).

- The total number of fruits used is calculated as:
  - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7` (since 1 + 2 + 4 = 7).

Now let's analyze the edge cases:

1. If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the minimum number of lemons that can be used is 0, since there are not enough apples or pears. The output should be `0`, which the program handles correctly.
   
2. If `a = 2`, `b = 5`, `c = 7`, the program finds that the maximum number of complete sets is 1 (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears), hence the output is `7`, which is correct.

3. For `a = 4`, `b = 7`, `c = 13`, the program calculates the maximum number of complete sets to be 3 (3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears), leading to an output of `21`, which is correct.

4. If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`, the program finds that no complete sets can be formed (0), leading to an output of `0`, which is correct.

After evaluating these cases, the program appears to correctly account for the requirements laid out in the problem description, handling both lower limits and the relationships between the quantities of fruits effectively.

Since I can't find any case where the program fails to produce the correct output based on the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
