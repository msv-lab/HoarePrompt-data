`c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected, and the value of `c` is now dependent on the user input but must remain a positive integer. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer as per user input.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer as per user input**
