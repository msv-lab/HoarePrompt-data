The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it seems that there might be predefined or global variables `a`, `b`, and `c` which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. However, without additional context regarding the function's behavior or return values, it is unclear what the function is intended to do or what it returns. 

Assuming there are different cases based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but without specific output information, we cannot ascertain the exact functionality or return values of the function. Therefore, the information is insufficient to define the functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but relies on predefined positive integers a, b, and c within the range of 1 to 1000. The return value is unspecified without further details.**
