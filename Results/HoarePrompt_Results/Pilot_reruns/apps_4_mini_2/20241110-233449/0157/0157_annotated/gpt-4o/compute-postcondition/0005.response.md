To determine the output state, we will first analyze the initial state and the impact of the code provided.

- The initial state has the following variables:
  - `a` is an input integer.
  - `b` is an input integer.
  - `c` is an input integer.
  - `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.
  - `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

The code snippet `print(total_fruits)` will output the value of `total_fruits`, which has been calculated based on the initial inputs.

Since we do not have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, we cannot compute exact numeric values. However, we can describe the output based on the state of the variables:

- `max_lemons` will be the minimum of:
  - `a`
  - `b // 2`
  - `c // 4`
  
- `total_fruits` will then be `max_lemons * 7`.

Thus, the output state will indicate the calculated value of `total_fruits` based on the initial inputs.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`), `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`, and it prints `total_fruits`.**
