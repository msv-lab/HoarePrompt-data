The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `b` is unknown, but it is stated to be a positive integer. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and `c` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is now an input integer (new value), and `c` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is now an input integer (new value), `c` is a positive integer**
