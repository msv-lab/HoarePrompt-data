To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Problem Breakdown:
Nikolay has:
- `a` lemons
- `b` apples
- `c` pears

He wants to cook a compote with a ratio of fruits of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits he can use while maintaining this ratio.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function reads three integers from input which represent the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It then calculates `min_lemon`, which is the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the ratios:
   - `a` (number of lemons available),
   - `b // 2` (since each lemon requires 2 apples),
   - `c // 4` (since each lemon requires 4 pears).
3. The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   ```
   min_lemon + (min_lemon * 2) + (min_lemon * 4) = min_lemon * 7
   ```
4. Finally, it prints this total.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations provide additional context on the state of the variables throughout the function. They confirm that:
- The input integers are correctly assigned.
- The calculation of `min_lemon` is based on the ratio constraints.
- The output is indeed calculated as `7 * min_lemon`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Values**:
   - For input `1, 1, 1` (1 lemon, 1 apple, 1 pear), the output should be `0` because there aren't enough apples or pears to meet the ratio requirements.
   - The code correctly handles this case since `min_lemon` would be `0` (1 lemon requires 2 apples and 4 pears).

2. **Sufficient Fruits**:
   - For input `4, 7, 13`, the code should calculate `3` lemons, `6` apples, and `12` pears as maximum usable fruits, resulting in `21`. The code correctly handles this.

3. **Excess Fruits**:
   - For input `1000, 2000, 4000`, the maximum is `1000` lemons, resulting in `7000`. The code should again handle this correctly.

4. **No Possible Compote**:
   - For input `2, 3, 2`, the code should yield `0` since there are not enough pears. The code should handle this correctly as well.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and its annotations against the problem description and example cases, there are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements. The program correctly computes the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote adhering to the specified ratios.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
