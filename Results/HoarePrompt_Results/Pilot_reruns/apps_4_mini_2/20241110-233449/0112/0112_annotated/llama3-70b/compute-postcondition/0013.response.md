Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all digits found in the lists within `cubes`, and `max_num` is the integer formed by joining the sorted elements of `digits` in reverse order. If '0' was present in `digits`, it is removed. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set, resulting in `max_num` being 0.**
