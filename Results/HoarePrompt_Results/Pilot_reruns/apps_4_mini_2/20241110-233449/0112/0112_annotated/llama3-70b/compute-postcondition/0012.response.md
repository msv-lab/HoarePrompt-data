Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all digits found in the lists within `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed, ensuring that '0' is no longer in the set. The value of `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers, and `cube` is the last list in `cubes`. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set.***
