The variable `digits` is initialized as an empty set. The initial state does not affect other variables, as the operation only impacts `digits`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input; `digits` is an empty set**
