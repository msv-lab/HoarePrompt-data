According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, the `cubes` list must contain at least one list (i.e., it should not be empty). Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it implies that the loop can iterate through `cubes` if it has at least one element. The variable `cube` will represent the first list in `cubes` during the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `cubes` must contain at least 1 list.
- `cube` is the first list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes**
