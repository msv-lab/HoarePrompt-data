The `remove` method is called on the `digits` set to remove the string representation of the digit '0'. If `digits` is an empty set, the code will raise a KeyError because it cannot remove a non-existent element. However, if '0' is present in `digits`, it will be removed, affecting the contents of the `digits` set. Other variables like `n` and `cubes` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state depends on whether '0' is in `digits`.

If '0' is in `digits`, the output state is: `digits` no longer contains '0'. The values of `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged. If '0' is not in `digits`, then an error would occur, but since we need to provide an output state, we will assume the operation is valid.

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists of integers; `cube` is the last list in `cubes`.**
