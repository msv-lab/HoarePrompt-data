The `digits` variable is updated with the string representations of each digit in the `cube` list. The value of `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, which contains integers. The `update` method adds each string representation of the digits from `cube` to `digits`. The previous values of `n` and `cubes` do not impact the execution of this line, so they remain unchanged. The output will reflect the updated state of `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
