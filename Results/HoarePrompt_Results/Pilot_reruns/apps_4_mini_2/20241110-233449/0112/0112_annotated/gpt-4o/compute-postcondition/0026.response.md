The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, which is its current value. Since `found` was already `False`, there is no change. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters; `digit` is the third character in the list; `found` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters; `digit` is the third character in the list; `found` is False**
