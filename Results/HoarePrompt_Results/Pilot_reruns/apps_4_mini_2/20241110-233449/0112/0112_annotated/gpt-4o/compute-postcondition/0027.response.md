According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `digits` list. Currently, `digits` has at least 3 characters. In the last iteration, `digit` is the third character in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that there are more characters in the `digits` list that have not been iterated over. 

Since `digit` is currently the third character, for the loop to run again, there must be at least one more character in the list. Therefore, we will adjust the state to indicate that `digits` must have at least 4 characters. Additionally, we need to update `digit` to represent the fourth character in the list and increment the iteration count accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 4 characters; `digit` is the fourth character in the list; `found` is False**
