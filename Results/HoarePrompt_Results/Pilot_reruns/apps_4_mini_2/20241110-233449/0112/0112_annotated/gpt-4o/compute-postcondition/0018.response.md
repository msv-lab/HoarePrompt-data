Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character. If `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either condition fails, `used_cubes[2]` remains unchanged and `found` may also remain unchanged.***
