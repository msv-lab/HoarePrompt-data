The function accepts an integer `num`, converts it to a list of its digits, and checks if each digit can be matched to the faces of a predefined number of cubes (`n`). It returns True if all digits can be matched to the cube faces without reusing any cube, and returns False if any digit cannot be matched. The function does not handle the case where `n` is not defined or is less than 1, which could lead to an error. Additionally, if `num` has no digits (i.e., if `num` is 0), the function would still return True because the loop would not execute.
