According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `digits`. If the list has at least 2 characters, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 character. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 characters, and the `digit` must be the second character in the list during the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters; `digit` is the second character in the list.**
