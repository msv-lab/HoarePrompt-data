According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, `digits` must contain at least one character. Additionally, the loop variable `digit` will take on each character from the `digits` list during each iteration. 

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it doesn't directly affect the loop execution but may indicate that the `used_cubes` list is appropriately sized.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `digits` has at least 1 character. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` containing `False` values, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list**
