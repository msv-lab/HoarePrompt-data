The value at index `i` in the list `used_cubes` is set to `True`. The variable `i` has a value of 1, but we have no information about the state of `used_cubes` before this operation. Since `n` and `digits` do not affect the operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `used_cubes[1]` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character; `i` is 1; `used_cubes[1]` is True**
