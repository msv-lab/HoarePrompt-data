Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list where the first element is set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` is True and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, leaving the other elements of `used_cubes` unchanged; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element; `found` is True indicating that a match was found; `i` is 0; if the condition is not met, `used_cubes`, `found`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
