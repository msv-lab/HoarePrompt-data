The assignment `found = False` sets the variable `found` to `False`, but since `found` was already `False`, there is no change in value. The other variables (`used_cubes`, `digits`, `i`, and `digit`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `digits` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, and `digit` is the second digit in the collection.

Output State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `digits` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `digit` is the second digit in the collection**
