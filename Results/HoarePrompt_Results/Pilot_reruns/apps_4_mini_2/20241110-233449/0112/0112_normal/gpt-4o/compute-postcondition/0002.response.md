According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. The loop will execute if `digits` is not empty. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` being a list of length `n` filled with `False` does not affect the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `digits` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element**
