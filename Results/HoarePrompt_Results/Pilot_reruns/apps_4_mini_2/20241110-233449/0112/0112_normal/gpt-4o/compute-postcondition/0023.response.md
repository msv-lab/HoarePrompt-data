According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` variable. If there are more digits to iterate over, the loop will execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, indicating that the loop has just started and is currently checking the first digit. Since `found` is still False and it was stated that the function returns False if no match is found, we can infer that there must be additional digits to process for the loop to continue.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that it reflects that the next digit is being processed. This means we need to increment `i` to 1, and we should also state that the `digit` is the second digit in the `digits` collection.

State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is still False, `digits` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `digit` is the second digit in the collection**
