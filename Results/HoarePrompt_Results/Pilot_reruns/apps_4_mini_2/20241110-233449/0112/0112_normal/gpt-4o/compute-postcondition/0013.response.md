Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is updated to set `used_cubes[1]` to True if `used_cubes[1]` was previously False and if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[1]`. `digits` remains unchanged, `found` remains True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the conditions are not met, `used_cubes`, `digits`, and `found` remain unchanged.***
