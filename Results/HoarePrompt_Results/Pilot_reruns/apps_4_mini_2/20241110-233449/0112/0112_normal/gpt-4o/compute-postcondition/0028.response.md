Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list indicating which cubes have been used based on the digits present in the `digits` list. If a digit matches one of the `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, the corresponding index in `used_cubes` is set to `True`. If all `used_cubes[i]` are `True` or if no digit matches any `cube_faces[i]`, the loop does not execute and `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If a match for a digit is not found, the function returns `False`, indicating that not all digits could be matched to available cubes.**
