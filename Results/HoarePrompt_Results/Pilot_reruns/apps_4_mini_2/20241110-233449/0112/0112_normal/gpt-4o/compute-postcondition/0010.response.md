The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, where `i` is currently 1. This means that the second element (index 1) of the `used_cubes` list is updated to `True`. The values of `n`, `digits`, and `found` remain unchanged, and only the state of `used_cubes` is affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is updated with the second element as `True`, `digits` is unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is updated with the second element as `True`, `digits` is unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1**
