According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 3, the loop will always have at least one iteration. The initial state indicates that `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, and `found` is `False`. 

At the start of the loop, `i` needs to be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0. Therefore, the relevant states are `n`, `i`, and potentially the elements of `used_cubes` if they need to be addressed within the loop. 

Since `digits` is a list with at least one element, it doesn't need adjustment for the loop to execute. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
