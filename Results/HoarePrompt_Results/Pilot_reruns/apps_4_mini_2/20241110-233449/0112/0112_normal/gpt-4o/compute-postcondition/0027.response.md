According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` collection. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `digits` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `digit` is the third digit in the collection. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased to 3, and `digit` should be updated to the fourth digit in the collection. Additionally, since `digits` remains unchanged, we can keep that state as it is. 

State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `digits` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `digit` is the fourth digit in the collection**
