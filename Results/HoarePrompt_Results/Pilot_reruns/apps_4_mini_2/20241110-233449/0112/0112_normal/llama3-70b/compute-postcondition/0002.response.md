The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. This does not affect the previous values of `n` or `cubes`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `digits` is now an empty set, while the values of `n` and `cubes` retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` sublists populated with integers from user input; `digits` is an empty set**
