The code updates the set `digits` by adding string representations of each integer in the sublist `cube`. The previous state of `digits` is a set containing string representations of integers from the second sublist `cube`. Since `cube` is part of `cubes`, which contains at least two sublists populated with integers, the values in `cube` will be iterated over, and their string representations will be added to `digits`. 

The impact of the code is that `digits` will now include all the string representations of the integers that were already in `digits` plus the new ones from `cube`. 

Since `n` is at least 2 and `cubes` contains at least two sublists, the state of the variables may change as follows:
- `digits` will contain more string representations than it initially did, depending on the integers in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `cubes` is a list of at least 2 sublists populated with integers; `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of integers from `cube`.**
