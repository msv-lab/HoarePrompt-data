According to the code, the loop iterates over each `cube` in the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least one more sublist beyond the third sublist, which is currently assigned to `cube`. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 3 sublists, and `cube` is currently the third sublist. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute again, `cubes` must have at least 4 sublists, and `cube` should be the fourth sublist in the list. 

State: **`n` is at least 3; `cubes` is a list of at least 4 sublists populated with integers; `cube` is the fourth sublist in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of integers from `cube`.**
