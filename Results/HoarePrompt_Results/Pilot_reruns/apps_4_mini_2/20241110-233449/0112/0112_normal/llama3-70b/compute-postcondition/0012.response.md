Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing string representations of all integers from all sublists in `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed; otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0, `digits` remains an empty set since the loop does not execute. Thus, after the execution, `digits` is either a set without '0' (if '0' was present) or unchanged (if '0' was not present).***
