According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will iterate over the elements in `cubes`, which is expected to contain `n` sublists populated with integers. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, for the loop to execute, the `cubes` list must contain at least one sublist, and `cube` should be the first sublist in `cubes` during the first iteration. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are that `cubes` must contain at least one sublist, and `cube` should be set to the first sublist in `cubes`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` sublists populated with integers, `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
