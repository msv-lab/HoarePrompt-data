Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of all integers from all sublists in `cubes`. If `n` is at least 1, then the loop executes once for each sublist in `cubes`. If `n` is 0 (which is not within the given constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 3), the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set.**
