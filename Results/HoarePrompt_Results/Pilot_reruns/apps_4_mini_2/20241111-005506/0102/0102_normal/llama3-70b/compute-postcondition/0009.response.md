The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the provided constraints, `s` is an integer that satisfies the condition 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. However, since `s` is not passed as an input to the function, its value is not defined in the context of the function's parameters.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine what the function returns based on the constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
