To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Input: An integer score `s` (0 ≤ s ≤ 99).
- Output: A string representing the score in English words, using lowercase letters and hyphens, without spaces.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Lists of Words**:
   - `ones`: Holds the English words for numbers 0-9.
   - `teens`: Holds the English words for numbers 10-19.
   - `tens`: Holds the English words for multiples of ten from 20 to 90.

2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The first condition checks if `s < 10`, outputting the corresponding word from the `ones` list. This correctly handles values from 0 (outputs an empty string) to 9.
   - The second condition checks if `s < 20`, outputting the corresponding word from the `teens` list. This correctly handles values from 10 to 19.
   - The final condition handles values 20 and above. It constructs the output string by combining the appropriate `tens` and `ones` words, using a hyphen if the ones place is not zero.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- **s = 0**: Outputs an empty string, which is not expected based on the problem description. The problem states that the output should be a single string consisting only of lowercase letters and hyphens. An empty string does not meet this requirement.
- **s = 1 to 9**: Outputs correctly as "one", "two", ..., "nine".
- **s = 10 to 19**: Outputs correctly as "ten", "eleven", ..., "nineteen".
- **s = 20 to 99**: Outputs correctly formatted as "twenty", "twenty-one", ..., "ninety-nine".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case when `s = 0`. According to the problem description, it should provide a valid English word representation, but instead, it outputs an empty string. This violation of the problem requirements indicates that the program is incorrect.

Thus, based on the analysis, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

The annotations helped identify the expected behavior of the program, but they also highlighted that the output for `s = 0` is not valid according to the problem description, confirming the program's failure to meet all requirements.
