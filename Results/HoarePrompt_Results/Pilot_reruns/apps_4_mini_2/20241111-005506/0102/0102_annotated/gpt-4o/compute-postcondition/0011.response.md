The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. After executing the function body, the behavior of the function is as follows:

- If `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding value from the `ones` list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding value from the `teens` list.
- If `n` is 10 or a multiple of 10 in the range of 10 to 99, the function returns the corresponding value from the `tens` list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive but not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string combining the value from the `tens` list and the value from the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen.
- Additionally, if `n` is 0, the function returns 'zero'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return a string representation of the number based on predefined lists for ones, teens, and tens, while handling the special case for zero correctly.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (0 ≤ n ≤ 99) and returns a string representation of the number according to its value, utilizing predefined lists for ones, teens, and tens, while returning 'zero' for the case when n is 0.**
