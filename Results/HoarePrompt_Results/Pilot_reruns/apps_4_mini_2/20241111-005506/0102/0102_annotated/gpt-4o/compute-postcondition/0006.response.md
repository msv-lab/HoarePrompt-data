The function returns the string representation of the integer `n` in the format of "tens-ones". The value of `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. The `tens` list provides the corresponding word for the tens place of `n`, and the `ones` list provides the corresponding word for the ones place of `n`. 

For the return statement, `n // 10` gives the tens place, and `n % 10` gives the ones place. Therefore, the final output will be a combination of the appropriate strings from the `tens` and `ones` lists, separated by a hyphen.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99; the function returns tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]**
