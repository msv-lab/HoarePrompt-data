The value of `n` is used to determine the tens place of the integer `n`, where `tens` is a list that contains the words for multiples of ten. The expression `n // 10` calculates the integer division of `n` by 10 to find the index for the `tens` list. The returned value corresponds to the appropriate word for the tens place based on the value of `n`.

Since `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 99\), the possible values of `n // 10` can range from 0 to 9. Therefore, `return tens[n // 10]` will return the appropriate string from the `tens` list.

The output state will include the current values of `n` and the returned string from the `tens` list based on the value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99; the function returns the corresponding value from `tens[n // 10]`**
