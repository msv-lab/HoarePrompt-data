To verify the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem states that we need to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array by performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions.

The program does the following:

1. Reads an integer `n`, which represents the size of the permutation.
2. Reads the permutation array `a` of size `n`.
3. Finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array.
4. Calculates `max_dist` as the maximum possible distance after one swap, considering the current distance and the boundaries of the array.
5. Calculates `min_dist` similarly.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_dist` and the distance after the swap.

Now, let's consider edge cases and potential flaws in the logic:

### Potential Case to Consider:
- If the array is already structured such that the elements 1 and n are at the ends (e.g., [1, 2, 3, ..., n]), then the distance is already maximized. In this case, a swap between any two elements will reduce the distance instead of maximizing it.

Let's check this with an example:
- Input: 
```
2
1 2
```
In this case, the positions of 1 and 2 are at indices 0 and 1, respectively. The distance is `1`. If we swap 1 and 2, they will still be adjacent, leading to a distance of `1`.

The program calculates:
- `pos1 = 0`
- `posn = 1`
- `max_dist = max(abs(0 - 1) - 1, 2 - 2) = max(0, 0) = 0`
- `min_dist = min(abs(0 - 1) - 1, 2 - 2) = min(0, 0) = 0`
- Result: `max(0, 2 - 1 - 0) = max(0, 1) = 1`

The output will be `1`, which is correct for this case.

However, it appears that the calculation logic for `max_dist` and `min_dist` is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly consider the scenario when the maximum distance is already present (i.e., 1 at one end and n at the other end). The logic should ensure that if 1 and n are already at the extremes, it should not reduce the distance.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis and the potential case where the program does not handle the situation correctly, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
