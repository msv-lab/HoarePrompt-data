To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: An integer `n` representing the size of the permutation and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Goal**: To maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap.

### Analysis of the Program
1. The program reads the size of the permutation and the permutation itself.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) using `index()`.
3. It calculates the distances from the minimum and maximum elements to the two ends of the array (positions 0 and n-1).
4. It then finds the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Potential Edge Cases
- If the permutation is already such that the minimum and maximum elements are at opposite ends (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), the program does not consider the fact that swapping may not change the distance.
- The code calculates the distances but does not check if a swap will actually allow the minimum and maximum to occupy the ends of the list, which might not always yield the maximum distance.

### Example Case to Test
Let's consider the case:
- Input: 
```
2
2 1
```
- Expected behavior: The minimum (1) is at position 1 and the maximum (2) is at position 0. Swapping them should yield a distance of 1.
- The program calculates distances as:
  - `dist1 = abs(0 - 1) = 1` (0 to max)
  - `dist2 = abs(1 - 1) = 0` (1 to max)
  - `dist3 = abs(0 - 1) = 1` (0 to min)
  - `dist4 = abs(1 - 1) = 0` (1 to min)
- The maximum distance calculated will be `1`, which is correct in this case.

Now consider:
- Input:
```
3
3 1 2
```
- Here, the minimum (1) is at position 1 and the maximum (3) is at position 0. The distance should be maximized to `2` by swapping 3 with 2, resulting in the arrangement `[2, 1, 3]` which gives a distance of `2`.

The program would calculate:
- `dist1 = abs(0 - 1) = 1`
- `dist2 = abs(2 - 1) = 1`
- `dist3 = abs(0 - 1) = 1`
- `dist4 = abs(2 - 1) = 1`
- The maximum distance calculated will be `1`, which is incorrect since the maximum distance achievable is indeed `2`.

### Conclusion
Since we have identified a case where the program does not correctly compute the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after a swap, we can conclude the following:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for the effect of swapping on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, leading to incorrect distance calculation.
