The list `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes an input string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where `n` is between 2 and 100, and each integer is also in the range from 1 to `n`. Therefore, after executing the code, `a` will be populated with the distinct integers provided in the input.

Since the exact integers inputted are not defined in the initial state, we can only describe `a` as a list of `n` distinct integers. The output state therefore reflects that `a` now holds the integers inputted.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted from user input.**
