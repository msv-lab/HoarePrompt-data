The given code aims to find the maximum possible distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap.

### Initial Assessment:

1. **Finding Positions**: The code correctly identifies the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the list.
2. **Calculating Maximum Distance**: The code attempts to compute the maximum distance using the formula:
   ```python
   max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
   min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
   ```
   However, this logic is flawed for the following reasons:
   - The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` does not correctly account for the possibility of maximizing the distance between 1 and n after a swap, especially when both elements are already on the edges of the array.
   - The expression `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` does not necessarily reflect the maximum distance achievable after a swap.

3. **Output**: The final output uses a maximum of these distances, which does not guarantee that the actual maximum distance achievable by any swap has been accurately computed.

### Edge Cases:

1. When both 1 and n are already at opposite ends (e.g., `[1, 2, ..., n]` or `[n, ..., 2, 1]`), the code should return `n - 1`, but the calculations may lead to incorrect interim results.
2. The scenario where the minimum and maximum elements are adjacent in the array will not be handled accurately by the logic provided.

### Output Hints Assessment:

The output hints state that the function does not handle cases where the input is not as specified (such as non-distinct integers or integers out of range). However, the problem description explicitly states that the integers are distinct and within the specified range. This means the hints about input validation issues do not apply here, as the problem guarantees valid inputs.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the logic for calculating the maximum distance and the potential edge cases where the code may produce incorrect results, the code does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of Incorrect Case**: For input `n = 5` and the array `[1, 3, 5, 4, 2]`, the expected output should be `3` after swapping `5` and `2`, but the code may not compute this correctly due to its flawed distance calculation logic.
