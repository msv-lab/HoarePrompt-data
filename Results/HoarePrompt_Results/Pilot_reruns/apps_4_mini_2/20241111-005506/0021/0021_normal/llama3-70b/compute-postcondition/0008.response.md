Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each integer in the range from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and n in the list, adjusted by the number of elements in the list, and prints this maximum distance. The function does not handle cases where the input is not as specified (e.g., if the input integers are not distinct or out of range), which may cause errors. **
