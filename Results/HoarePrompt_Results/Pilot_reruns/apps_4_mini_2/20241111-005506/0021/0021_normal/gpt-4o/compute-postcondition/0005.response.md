The variable `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The initial state provides that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is distinct in the list, `max_pos` will be a valid index. The calculation involves determining the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`.

Since no specific values for `n` and `max_pos` are provided, we can express `dist2` in relation to the variables:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`

Thus, `dist2` will vary based on the values of `n` and `max_pos`, but it is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer due to the use of the `abs` function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of n in the list a; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
