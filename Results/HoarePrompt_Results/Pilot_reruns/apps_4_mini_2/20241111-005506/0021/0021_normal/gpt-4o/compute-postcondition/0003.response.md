The code assigns the value of `max_pos` to the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The variable `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers. The specific value of `max_pos` will depend on the position of `n` in the list `a`. Since `min_pos` is not affected by this operation, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged `min_pos` and the newly calculated `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in the list `a`.**
