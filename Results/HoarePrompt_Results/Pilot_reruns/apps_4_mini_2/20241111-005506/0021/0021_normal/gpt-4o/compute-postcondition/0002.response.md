The value of `min_pos` is assigned the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The integer `1` is guaranteed to be present in `a` since `a` contains distinct integers from `1` to `n`. Therefore, `min_pos` will hold the position of `1` within the list. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`.**
