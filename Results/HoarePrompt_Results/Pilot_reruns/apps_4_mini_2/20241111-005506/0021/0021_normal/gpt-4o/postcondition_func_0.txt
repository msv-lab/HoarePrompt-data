The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance from either end of the list to the positions of the integers 1 and `n`, and prints this maximum distance. The function does not validate the input, so it assumes the input adheres to the specified constraints.
