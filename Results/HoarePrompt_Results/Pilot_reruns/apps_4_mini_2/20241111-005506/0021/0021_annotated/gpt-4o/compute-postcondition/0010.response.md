The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. 

The function does not explicitly return any value in the provided context, but based on the constraints and relationships, we can infer its functionality. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n).**
