To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's break down the key requirements and analyze the code.

### Problem Description Recap
1. **Input**: An integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n.
2. **Goal**: Perform exactly one swap to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n).
3. **Output**: The maximum possible distance achieved by the swap.

### Code Analysis
- The program reads the input values for `n` and the list `a`.
- It identifies the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list using the `index()` method.
- It calculates four potential distances:
  - `dist1`: distance from the minimum (1) to the maximum (n) when the maximum is at the start (index 0).
  - `dist2`: distance from the minimum (1) to the maximum (n) when the maximum is at the end (index n-1).
  - `dist3`: distance from the maximum (n) to the minimum (1) when the minimum is at the start (index 0).
  - `dist4`: distance from the maximum (n) to the minimum (1) when the minimum is at the end (index n-1).
- Finally, it takes the maximum of these four distances and prints it.

### Annotations Review
The annotations in the code provide insights into the state of the variables at each step. They highlight that the program calculates distances based on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, but they also note that the `index()` method will throw a `ValueError` if `1` or `n` is not present, which is not applicable here as per the problem constraints.

### Edge Cases Consideration
- The program assumes that both `1` and `n` are present in the list. Given the problem constraints (distinct integers from 1 to n), this assumption holds true.
- The program calculates distances based on the boundaries of the list, which is essential for maximizing the distance between the two elements.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the examples given in the problem statement:
1. For the input `5, 4 5 1 3 2`, the program correctly identifies the minimum at index 2 and maximum at index 1, calculating the maximum distance to be `3`.
2. For the input `7, 1 6 5 3 4 7 2`, the program identifies the positions correctly and outputs `6`.
3. For the input `6, 6 5 4 3 2 1`, the output is `5`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion
Upon analyzing the code, annotations, and examples:
- The code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
- It handles the input constraints effectively, ensuring that both `1` and `n` are accounted for.
- Each test case aligns with the expected output.

Thus, I conclude that the program is indeed correct for every potential case described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
