The variable `a` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which creates a list of integers by taking input as a space-separated string and converting each element to an integer. The value of `n` defines how many distinct integers are expected in the list `a`, and since `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `a` will contain exactly `n` distinct integers. The previous values of `n` and `a` are now affected; `a` will hold the values provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input.**
