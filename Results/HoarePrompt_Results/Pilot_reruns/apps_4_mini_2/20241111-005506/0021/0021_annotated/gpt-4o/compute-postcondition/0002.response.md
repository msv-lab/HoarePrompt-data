The code assigns to `min_pos` the index of the value `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `n` is at least `2`, we need to assume that `1` is present in `a` for this code to execute successfully. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (which is an integer in the range of `2` to `100`) and `a` (which contains `n` distinct integers, including the integer `1`).

After executing the line of code, `min_pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`. The value of `min_pos` will be an integer corresponding to that index.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a**.
