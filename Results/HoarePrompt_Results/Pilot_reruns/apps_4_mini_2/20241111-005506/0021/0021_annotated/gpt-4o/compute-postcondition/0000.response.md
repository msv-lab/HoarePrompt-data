The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is unspecified, but it must satisfy the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`. The variable `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers**
