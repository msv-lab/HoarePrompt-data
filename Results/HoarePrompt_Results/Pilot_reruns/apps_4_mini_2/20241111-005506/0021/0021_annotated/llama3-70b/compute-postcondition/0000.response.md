The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and thus the value of `n` will now be an input integer within that range. The list `a` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n**
