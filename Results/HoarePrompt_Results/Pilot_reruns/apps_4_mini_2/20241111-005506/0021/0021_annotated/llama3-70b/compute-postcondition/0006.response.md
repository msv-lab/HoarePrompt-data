To determine the output state, we analyze the code snippet provided.

1. The `max()` function is called with two arguments: `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.
2. The `max_dist` is already calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
3. The `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
4. The expression `n - 1 - min_dist` is evaluated using the previously calculated `min_dist`.
5. Finally, the `max()` function will return the larger of `max_dist` or `n - 1 - min_dist`.

The output of the `print()` function does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state will include the values of the relevant variables as well as the result of the `print()` statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in the list `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); and the value printed is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist).**
