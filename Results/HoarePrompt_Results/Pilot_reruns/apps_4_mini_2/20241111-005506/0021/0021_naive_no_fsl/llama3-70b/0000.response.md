To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down its logic step by step and see if it handles all potential edge cases.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap.
   - The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the array.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the size of the permutation and the permutation itself.

3. **Finding Positions:**
   - It locates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements using `a.index(1)` and `a.index(n)`, which is correct for distinct elements.

4. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the current distance between the minimum and maximum elements:
     ```python
     max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     ```
   - This logic is flawed. The `max_dist` should be the maximum distance achievable after one swap, not based on the current distance minus one. The distance should be calculated based on the farthest possible positions after a swap.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program attempts to print `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`, which does not accurately represent the maximum possible distance between the two elements after a swap.

### Edge Case:
To illustrate a failing case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  4
  2 1 3 4
  ```
  Here, the positions of 1 and 4 are:
  - Position of 1: 1
  - Position of 4: 3
  - Current distance = |1 - 3| = 2
  - The maximum achievable distance after one swap (swapping 1 and 4) would be |0 - 3| = 3.

However, the program's logic will not correctly calculate this distance due to its flawed handling of the `max_dist` and `min_dist`. It will not provide the correct output for this case.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, as demonstrated. Thus, the overall correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
