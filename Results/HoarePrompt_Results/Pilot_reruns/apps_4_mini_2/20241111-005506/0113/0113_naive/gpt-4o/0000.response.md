To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to compute the k-rounding of a positive integer n. This means finding the minimum positive integer x such that:
1. x is divisible by n.
2. x ends with at least k zeros in base 10.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Multiplier Calculation**:
   - The variable `multiplier` is calculated as `10 ** k`, which correctly establishes the base for the number of zeros required.

2. **Calculating x**:
   - The formula `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` intends to find the least common multiple (LCM) of n and the multiplier, ensuring that x is divisible by n and has at least k trailing zeros.
   - The LCM can be computed using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`, which the program effectively implements.

3. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the example case `375 4`, the program computes `multiplier` as `10000` (10^4) and correctly calculates `x` to be `30000`.
   - For `10000 1`, `multiplier` is `10`, and the output is `10000`, which is correct.
   - For `38101 0`, the output is `38101`, which is also correct as it doesn't require any trailing zeros.
   - For `123456789 8`, `multiplier` is `100000000`, and it correctly computes `x` as `12345678900000000`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case with k = 0**: The program handles this correctly by simply returning n, as shown in the third example.
- **Case with maximum values**: If we test with the upper limits (e.g., `n = 1000000000` and `k = 8`), the program should still work since Python handles large integers well.

### Conclusion:
After checking various scenarios and edge cases, the code adheres to both the requirements of the problem description and the provided examples. All potential cases have been accounted for, and the program's logic checks out.

Correctness: **True**.
