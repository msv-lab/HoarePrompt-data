The function `func` accepts two integers as input from the user: `n`, a positive integer, and `k`, a non-negative integer. The function calculates `x`, which is 10 raised to the power of `k`. It then increments `n` until it becomes divisible by `x`. If `n` is already divisible by `x`, it remains unchanged. Finally, the function prints the value of `n`. 

The functionality of the function does not accept parameters directly but takes user input instead. It ensures that the output is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input `n` that is divisible by `10^k`. 

Functionality: ** The function takes two integers from user input, `n` and `k`, and prints the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that is divisible by `10^k`. **
