The value of `n` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `n` is an input positive integer, which remains unspecified. The values of `k` and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer, `x` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer, `x` is 10**
