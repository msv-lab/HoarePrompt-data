The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is an input positive integer that has already been incremented by 1, the new value of `n` will be `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1 again, `k` is an input non-negative integer, `x` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1 again, `k` is an input non-negative integer, `x` is 10**
