The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 ≤ k ≤ 8\). Based on the value of `k`, a `multiplier` is determined, which can be one of the values: 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The function then returns `x`, which is calculated as \(x = n \times \left(\frac{multiplier}{\text{math.gcd}(n, multiplier)}\right)\). 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a `multiplier` based on `k`, and returns the value of `n` multiplied by the `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`.**
