The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8. The function computes a `multiplier` equal to \( 10^k \) and then calculates `x` as \( n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{math.gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right) \). Finally, the function returns the value of `x`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and it returns the value of `x` computed from `n` and `k` based on the specified formula.**
