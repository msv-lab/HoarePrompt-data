Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then increments `n` until it finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original `n` that is divisible by `x`, and finally prints this value of `n`. The function does not return any value. **
