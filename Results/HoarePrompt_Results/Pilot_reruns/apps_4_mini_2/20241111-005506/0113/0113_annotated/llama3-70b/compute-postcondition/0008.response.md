Output State: **`if n is initially not divisible by x, then n will be incremented until it becomes divisible by x; at the end, n will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original n that is divisible by x. If n is initially divisible by x, the loop does not execute and n remains unchanged. k remains a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8, and x remains an integer within the range 1 to 10000000000.`**
