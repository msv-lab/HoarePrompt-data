Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`) such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is set to infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `s_i`, `d_i` are the first and second elements of `bus_routes[0]` respectively. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus is available immediately. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative integer reflecting the time until the next bus arrives. This encompasses all cases, including scenarios where the bus arrives before `t`, exactly at `t`, or after `t`, as well as the edge cases where `s_i` equals `t` or when `t` is just after `s_i` but still requires waiting for the next bus.***
