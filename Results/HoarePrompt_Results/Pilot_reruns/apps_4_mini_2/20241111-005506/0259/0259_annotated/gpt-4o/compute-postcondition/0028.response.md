Postcondition: ***`s_i` and `d_i` are values from `bus_routes[n]`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If the difference `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative value less than `d_i` and accounts for the case when `s_i` is less than `t` but not a multiple of `d_i`.***
