The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100000\).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers \((s_i, d_i)\) such that \(1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000\).

After executing the function body, the function calculates the minimum wait time based on the provided bus routes and returns `chosen_route`, which is the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and return the index of the bus route that has the minimum wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a positive integer t, and a list of tuples bus_routes, and returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time.**
