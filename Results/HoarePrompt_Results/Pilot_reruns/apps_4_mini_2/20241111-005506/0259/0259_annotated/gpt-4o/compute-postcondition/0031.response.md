Postcondition: ***`s_i` and `d_i` are values from `bus_routes[n]`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This ensures that `min_wait_time` retains its previous value if `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, correctly reflecting the minimum wait time encountered so far. Additionally, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions defined, ensuring that it is a non-negative value less than `d_i`, thus accounting for all edge cases regarding the relationship between `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`.***
