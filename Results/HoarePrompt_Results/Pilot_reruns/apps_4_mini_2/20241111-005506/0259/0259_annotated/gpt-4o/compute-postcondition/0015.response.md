The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`), `wait_time` is 0**
