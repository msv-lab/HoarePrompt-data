According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be greater than 0. Since the given state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, this condition is already satisfied. The variable `i` will start at 0 and will increment up to `n - 1` during the loop iterations.

At the beginning of the loop:
- `i` will be 0 for the first iteration.

No adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute, as all necessary conditions are already satisfied based on the provided state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is set to infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
