Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`). If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that the chosen route corresponds to the minimum wait time among the evaluated bus routes.***
