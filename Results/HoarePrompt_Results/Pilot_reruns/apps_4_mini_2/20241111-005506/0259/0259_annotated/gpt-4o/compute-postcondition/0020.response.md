The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unknown, but it must be incremented by 1. The initial value of `min_wait_time` is unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `chosen_route`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
