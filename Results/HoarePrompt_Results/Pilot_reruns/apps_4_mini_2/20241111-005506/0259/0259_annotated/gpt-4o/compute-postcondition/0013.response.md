The variable `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` will take the values from the `n`-th tuple in the `bus_routes` list. The previous values of `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the current state of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, and the assigned values for `s_i` and `d_i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`), `s_i` is the start of the bus route for the `n`-th tuple, `d_i` is the destination of the bus route for the `n`-th tuple.**
