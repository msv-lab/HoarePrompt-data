The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it relies on external input constraints where `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and each bus route defined by `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000). 

The function processes this input and returns some output based on the defined relationships and constraints. However, since there is no detailed output description provided, we cannot describe specific return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on external constraints for `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. The specific return value is not detailed.**
