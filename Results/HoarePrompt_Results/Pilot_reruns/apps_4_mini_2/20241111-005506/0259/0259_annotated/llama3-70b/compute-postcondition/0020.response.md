According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `buses` list and the current value of `i`. The loop will iterate until `i` is no longer less than the length of `buses`. At the end of the last iteration, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, and `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1, and `buses` still must contain at least 1 tuple.

Since `i` is currently 0, the next iteration will be valid as long as `buses` has at least 1 tuple. Therefore, we just need to adjust `i` to indicate the next index.

State: **`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is updated to `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is set to 1 if `time` is less than `min_time`, otherwise `ans` is -1, `i` is 1**
