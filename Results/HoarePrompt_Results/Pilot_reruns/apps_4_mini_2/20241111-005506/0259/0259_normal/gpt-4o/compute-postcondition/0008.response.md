Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `i` is 0; `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[0]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`, indicating the bus departure time is after `t`. If the bus arrives exactly at time `t` (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0), then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives, thus covering all scenarios of bus timing in relation to `t`.***
