Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than `i`; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1. If `s_i` (the start time from `bus_routes[i]`) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`, indicating the wait time until the bus departs after time `t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i` (the bus frequency), then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which represents the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. All cases are handled to ensure `wait_time` is appropriately defined based on the relationship between `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`.***
