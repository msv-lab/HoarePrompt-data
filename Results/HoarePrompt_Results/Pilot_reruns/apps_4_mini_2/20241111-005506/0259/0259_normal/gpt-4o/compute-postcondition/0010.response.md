The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `chosen_route`. However, the operation indicates that `chosen_route` will be one more than whatever the current value of `i` is. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1**
