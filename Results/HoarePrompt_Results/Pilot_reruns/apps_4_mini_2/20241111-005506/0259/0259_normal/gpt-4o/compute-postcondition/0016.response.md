The code calculates the wait time based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i` which are taken from the `bus_routes` list at index `i`. The value `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. 

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000.
- `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.
- Since `min_wait_time` is set to float('inf') and `chosen_route` is -1, these do not impact the wait time calculation directly.

Thus, `wait_time` is calculated using the provided formula. The output state includes the values of `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and the computed `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` is greater than `i`; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
