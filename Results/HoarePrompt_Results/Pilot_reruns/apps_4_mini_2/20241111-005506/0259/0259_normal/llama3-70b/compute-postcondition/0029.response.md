Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the current tuple being processed. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, then `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
