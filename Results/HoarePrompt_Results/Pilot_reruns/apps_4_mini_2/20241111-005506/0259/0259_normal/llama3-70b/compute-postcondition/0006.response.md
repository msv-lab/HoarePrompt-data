The code takes input values for `s` and `d`, converting them to integers, which will then be assigned to the respective variables. The initial state of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remains unchanged. The variable `_`, which represents the current iteration count, will be incremented by 1 after this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing the tuple (s, d), `_` is incremented by 1, and `s` and `d` are assigned input integers**.
