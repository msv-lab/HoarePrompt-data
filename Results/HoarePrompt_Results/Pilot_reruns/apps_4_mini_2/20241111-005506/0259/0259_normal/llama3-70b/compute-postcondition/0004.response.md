The code `buses.append((s, d))` adds a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` is an empty list, and `s` and `d` are input integers. Therefore, after the execution, `buses` will contain one tuple with the values of `s` and `d`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing the tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
