The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from `input().split()`, which takes a space-separated input and splits it into two parts, converting them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since `n` and `t` are not directly affected by this code, their values remain unchanged. The list `buses` is also unaffected and remains empty. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions of `n`, `t`, and `buses`, along with the new variables `s` and `d` which are integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
