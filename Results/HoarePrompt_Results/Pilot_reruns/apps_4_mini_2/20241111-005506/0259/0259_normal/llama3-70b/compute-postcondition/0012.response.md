Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers, where each tuple consists of the input integers `s` and `d` collected from the user; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000. If `n` is 0 or less than 1 (even though the constraints mentioned n is positive), the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.**
