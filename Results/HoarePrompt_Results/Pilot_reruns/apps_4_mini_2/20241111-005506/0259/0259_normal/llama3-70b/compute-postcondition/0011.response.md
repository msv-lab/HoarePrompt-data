According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the value of `_`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n - 1`, which means the next iteration will be the last one (when `_` becomes `n`). Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to `n` and `n` remains unchanged. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is `n`, and `buses` contains all previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d)**
