According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. The variable `n` is already defined as a positive integer (between 1 and 100), which means the loop can execute at least once. The variable `buses` is an empty list, but it does not affect the execution of the loop itself. The loop variable `_` is commonly used when the value is not needed.

Since `n` is already a positive integer and can be utilized directly in the loop, no adjustments are needed for `n` or for the loop variable. However, since `buses` is an empty list, we note that it can be filled during the iterations.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
