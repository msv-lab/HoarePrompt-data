According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` has been incremented by 1, meaning it is now equal to the previous value of `_ + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be adjusted to be less than `n`.

Given that `_` has been incremented by 1, it means that if it was previously less than `n`, it would now be equal to `n`. Therefore, to allow for another iteration, we need to adjust `_` to be equal to `n - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and `buses` continues to contain all previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is n - 1, and `buses` contains all previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d)**
