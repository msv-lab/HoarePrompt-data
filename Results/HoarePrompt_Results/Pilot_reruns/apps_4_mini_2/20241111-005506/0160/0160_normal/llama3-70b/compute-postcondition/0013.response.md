The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1, the maximum will be at least `gcd` or 1. Therefore, `max_divisor` will remain the same or possibly increase if `gcd` is less than `i`. The output state reflects the comparison result without changing other variable states.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is the maximum of `gcd` and 1**
