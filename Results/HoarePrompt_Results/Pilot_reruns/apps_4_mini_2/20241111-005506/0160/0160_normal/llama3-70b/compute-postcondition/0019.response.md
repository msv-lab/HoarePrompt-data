The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 2, `gcd // i` will be at least `1 // 2`, which results in 0 if `gcd` is 1, or at least 1 for larger values of `gcd`. The previous value of `max_divisor` is not specified, but it will be compared to the calculated value from `gcd // i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_divisor`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`**
