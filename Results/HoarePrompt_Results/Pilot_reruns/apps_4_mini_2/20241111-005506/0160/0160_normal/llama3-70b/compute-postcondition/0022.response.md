According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. We also need to ensure that the range is still valid, which means `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be at least 1. However, we need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is greater than or equal to 3 for the next iteration to be valid (which means `gcd` must be at least 9).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `gcd` must be greater than or equal to 9 to ensure that the loop can execute again.
- `i` should be updated to 3.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3**
