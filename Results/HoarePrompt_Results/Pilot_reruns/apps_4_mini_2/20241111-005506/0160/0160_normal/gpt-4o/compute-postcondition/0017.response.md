Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `x`, including those greater than `sqrt(x)`, in reverse order. If `x` is less than 1, the function returns an empty list since no divisors will be found. If `x` is 1, the function returns a list containing only the number 1. **
