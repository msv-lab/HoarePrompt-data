The code `divisors.add(x // i)` adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The previous state indicates that `divisors` currently contains only the value {1}. The values of `x` and `i` are not provided, but we know `x` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to 1.

Since `i` is 1, the expression `x // i` simplifies to `x // 1`, which is simply `x`. The value of `x` is at least 1, so `x // 1` will yield at least 1. Hence, the new value being added to `divisors` will be `x`, which is at least 1.

If `x` is 1, then the set remains {1}. If `x` is greater than 1, then it will add that value to the set.

However, since sets do not allow duplicate entries, if `x` is equal to 1, the set remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than 1, `divisors` will become `{1, x}`.

Therefore, the output state is dependent on the value of `x`:

- If `x` is 1: `divisors` remains {1}.
- If `x` is greater than 1: `divisors` becomes {1, x}.

Since we cannot determine a specific value for `x`, we can conclude that the output state reflects the potential change in `divisors`.

Output State: **`divisors` is either {1} or {1, x} depending on the value of `x`**
