The line of code `divisors.add(x // i)` adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The variable `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(x))`, which means it is the integer square root of `x`. The value of `x` has not been specified in the initial state, but it is assumed to be an integer, and thus `x // i` will be calculated based on the value of `x`.

Since `divisors` now includes the value `i`, the output state will reflect that `divisors` will now also include `x // i`.

The output state will summarize the current state of `N`, `A`, `K`, `i`, and the updated state of `divisors`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9; `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x))`; `divisors` now includes the value `i` and `x // i`**.
