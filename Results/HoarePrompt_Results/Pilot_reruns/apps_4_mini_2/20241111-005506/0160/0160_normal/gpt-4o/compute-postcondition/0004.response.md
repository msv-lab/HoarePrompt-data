Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `divisors` is a set that may include the integer `1` and/or `x` depending on whether `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` is updated to include both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged as an empty set. Additionally, since `i` is initialized to 1 and `x` is at least 1, `divisors` will always include at least the value `1` when `x` is not zero.***
