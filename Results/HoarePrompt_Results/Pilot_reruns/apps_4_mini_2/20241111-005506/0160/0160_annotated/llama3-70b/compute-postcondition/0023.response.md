The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 3, and `gcd` is greater than 4 (which implies that `max_divisor` must also be greater than 3), `max_divisor` will remain unchanged if it is already greater than 3. Therefore, the output state reflects that `gcd` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` remains unchanged**.
