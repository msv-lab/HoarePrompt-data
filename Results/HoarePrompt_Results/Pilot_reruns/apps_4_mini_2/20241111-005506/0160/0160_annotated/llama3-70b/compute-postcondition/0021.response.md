Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, and if `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd` divided by `i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.***
