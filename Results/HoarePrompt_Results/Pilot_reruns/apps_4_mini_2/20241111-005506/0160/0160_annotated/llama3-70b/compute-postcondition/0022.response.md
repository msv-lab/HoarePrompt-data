According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 4. To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration, I need to find out if `i` can be incremented and still be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

If `gcd` is 4, then `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is 2, and since `i` is already 2, the loop will not execute again. If `gcd` is greater than 4, then `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be greater than 2, allowing `i` to increment to 3. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `gcd` must be greater than 4, and `i` will be incremented to 3.

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, I need to adjust the state to reflect that `gcd` is greater than 4 and that `i` is now 3.

State: **`gcd` is greater than 4, `i` is 3**
