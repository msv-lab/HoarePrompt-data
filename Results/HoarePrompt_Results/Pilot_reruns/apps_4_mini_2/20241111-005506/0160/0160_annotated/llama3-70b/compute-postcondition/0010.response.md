Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `i` is `N-1` after the loop completes. If `N` is 2 or more, the loop executes `N-1` times. If `N` is less than 2 (not applicable here as per the initial state), the loop does not execute and `gcd` remains as `A[0]`.**
