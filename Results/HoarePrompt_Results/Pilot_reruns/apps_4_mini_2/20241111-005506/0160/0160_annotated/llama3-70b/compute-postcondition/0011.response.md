The variable `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`. Since `gcd` is defined as the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, it retains its value from before. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is `N-1` after the loop completes. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `i` is `N-1`, and `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`.

Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `i` is `N-1`, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`**.
