According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, we need to find the new value of `i`.

Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. 

We also need to ensure that `x` remains consistent with the conditions of the divisors set. The condition regarding `x` being greater than or equal to 1 still holds, as it was given in the initial state.

Therefore, the adjusted states should reflect that `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. The other states remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is a set that includes 1 and `x` if `x` is divisible by 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**
