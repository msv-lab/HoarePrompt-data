The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. The function computes all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and then returns these divisors as a sorted list in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept an integer `x` and return a sorted list of its divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, sorted in reverse order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns a sorted list of all divisors of x that are less than or equal to the square root of x, in reverse order.**
