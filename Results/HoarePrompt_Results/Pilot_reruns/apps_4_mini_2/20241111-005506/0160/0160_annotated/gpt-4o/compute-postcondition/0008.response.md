Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6. If `x` is divisible by 2, then `divisors` includes 1, 2, and `x // 2`. If `x` is odd or not divisible by 2, then `divisors` remains unchanged.***
