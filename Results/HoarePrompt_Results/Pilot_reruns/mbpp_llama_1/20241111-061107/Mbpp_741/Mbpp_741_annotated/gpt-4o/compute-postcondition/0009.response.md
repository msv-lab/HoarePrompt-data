To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is not empty with at least one character removed from the beginning. This implies that the first character of the original `s` has been processed and removed from consideration for the next iteration.
3. `first_char` is the first character of the current `s`, which means it is the character that will be processed in the next iteration if the loop continues.
4. `char` is the second character of the original `s`. Since one character has been removed from the beginning of `s`, `char` is now the first character of the original `s` minus one character.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

* `s` must still have at least one character left to process.
* The next character to be processed is the current `first_char`.

Since `s` has at least one character removed from the beginning, and `first_char` is the first character of the current `s`, we can infer that `s` still has at least one character left to process. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to update `char` to be the next character in the sequence.

State: **`s` is not empty with at least one character removed from the beginning, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of the current `s` (which is the third character of the original `s`)**
