Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether all characters in the input string are the same or not. Here's why:

- It first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns True, which is correct because an empty string can be considered to have all characters the same (vacuously true).
- It then stores the first character of the string in the variable `first_char`.
- The function then iterates over each character in the string. If it finds a character that is different from `first_char`, it immediately returns False.
- If the function iterates over the entire string without finding any characters that are different from `first_char`, it returns True, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different cases where the function should return True or False.

After analyzing the code and considering different potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
