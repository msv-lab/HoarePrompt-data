To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one fewer character than before, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the second character of `s`.

For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more character in `s` to iterate over. Since `char` is the second character of `s`, we know that `s` has at least two characters. To execute the loop again, `s` should still be a non-empty string, but with at least one fewer character than before the previous iteration.

The state of `first_char` does not affect the loop condition, so it can remain the same.

The state of `char` needs to be adjusted to be the next character in `s`. Since `char` is currently the second character of `s`, it should become the third character of `s` (or the first character of the remaining string after the previous iteration).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one fewer character than before, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character of `s`**
