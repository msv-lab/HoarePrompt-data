The function returns `len(set(s)) == 1`. The value of `s` is a non-empty string, so `set(s)` is a set containing the unique characters in `s`. The `len` function returns the number of elements in this set, which is 1 if and only if all characters in `s` are the same. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all characters in `s` are the same and `False` otherwise. The state of `s` is not changed, so the output state is `s` is a non-empty string, and the function returns `True` if all characters in `s` are the same and `False` otherwise.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, and the function returns `True` if all characters in `s` are the same and `False` otherwise**
