Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` as input.

The code first calculates the count of even numbers in the list using a generator expression: `even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)`. This is a correct implementation.

Then, it calculates the count of odd numbers in the list by subtracting the even count from the total length of the list: `odd_count = len(lst) - even_count`. This is also correct.

Next, it calculates the number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed from the list using the formula `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. This is correct.

Similarly, it calculates the number of pairs of odd numbers that can be formed from the list using the same formula: `odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. This is also correct.

Finally, it returns the sum of the even pairs and odd pairs: `return even_pairs + odd_pairs`. This is correct.

However, there are some potential edge cases to consider:

* If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which is correct.
* If the input list contains only one element, the function will return 0, which is correct.
* If the input list contains only even numbers, the function will return the correct number of pairs of even numbers.
* If the input list contains only odd numbers, the function will return the correct number of pairs of odd numbers.

Based on the analysis, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns the total number of pairs of numbers that can be formed, where each pair consists of either even or odd numbers. The function correctly handles edge cases, including empty lists, lists with one element, and lists with only even or odd numbers. **
