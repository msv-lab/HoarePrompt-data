To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in `lst`.

The code is: `odd_count = len(lst) - even_count`

This code calculates the count of odd numbers in the list `lst` by subtracting the count of even numbers (`even_count`) from the total length of the list (`len(lst)`).

Since the value of `lst` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `odd_count`. However, we can express the output state in terms of the initial state.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in `lst` (i.e., `len(lst) - even_count`).**
