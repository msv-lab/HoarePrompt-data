The function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`. The state of the variables does not change, so the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is the number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed from `lst`, `odd_pairs` is the number of pairs of odd numbers that can be formed from `lst`, and the function returns `even_pairs + odd_pairs`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is the number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed from `lst`, `odd_pairs` is the number of pairs of odd numbers that can be formed from `lst`, and the function returns `even_pairs + odd_pairs`.**
