The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` can be either 0 or 1, so the new value of `count` is either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `count` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `count` is either 1 or 2**
