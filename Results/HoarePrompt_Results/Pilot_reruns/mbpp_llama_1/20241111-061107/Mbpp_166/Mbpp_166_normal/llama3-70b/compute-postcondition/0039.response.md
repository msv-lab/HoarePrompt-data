The function returns `count`, and `count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the bitwise XOR of the elements is even. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: `count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the bitwise XOR of the elements is even, `i` and `j` are the indices of the last pair of elements checked in the loop, and the function returns `count`.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the bitwise XOR of the elements is even, `i` and `j` are the indices of the last pair of elements checked in the loop, and the function returns `count`.**
