Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the sum of the bitwise XOR of the first element and the other elements is even, `i` is 1, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `count` is incremented by 1, otherwise it remains unchanged.***
