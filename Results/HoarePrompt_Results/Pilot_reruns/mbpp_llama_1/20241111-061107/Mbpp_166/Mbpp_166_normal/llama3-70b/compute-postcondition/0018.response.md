The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the sum of the bitwise XOR of the first element and the other elements is even. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3**
