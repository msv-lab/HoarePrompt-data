Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 4 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the sum of the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and the other elements is even, incremented by 1 if the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, otherwise remains unchanged.***
