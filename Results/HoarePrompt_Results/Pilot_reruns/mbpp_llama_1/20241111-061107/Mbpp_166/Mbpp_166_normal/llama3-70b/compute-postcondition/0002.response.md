To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that allow it to run. The loop iterates over a range starting from `i + 1` to the length of `nums`. For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be met:

1. `nums` must be a non-empty list of integers, which is already given.
2. `i` must be less than the length of `nums` minus 1, so that `i + 1` is within the bounds of `nums`.

Given that `i` is 0, this condition is already satisfied if `nums` has at least 2 elements. 

However, to make it explicit that the loop can execute, we should state that `nums` has at least 2 elements, and since `j` is the loop variable, its initial value should be `i + 1`, which is 1.

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
