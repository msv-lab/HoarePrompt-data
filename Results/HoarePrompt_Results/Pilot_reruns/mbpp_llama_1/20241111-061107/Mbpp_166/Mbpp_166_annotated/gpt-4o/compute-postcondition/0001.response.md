`odd_count` is assigned the value `len(lst) - even_count`. The value of `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, and `len(lst)` is the total number of integers in `lst`. Therefore, `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in `lst`**
