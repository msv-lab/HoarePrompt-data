The function accepts a list of integers, calculates the number of even and odd integers in the list, and returns the total number of pairs of even and odd integers that can be chosen from the list. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. The function assumes that the input list only contains integers and may raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results if this assumption is not met.
