To calculate the output state, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`.
2. For each element, it checks if the remainder of `x` divided by 2 is equal to 0 using the condition `x % 2 == 0`.
3. If the condition is true, it counts the element as 1; otherwise, it counts it as 0.
4. The `sum` function adds up these counts to get the total number of even integers in the list.
5. The result is assigned to the variable `even_count`.

Since the initial state only mentions that `lst` is a list of integers, we don't know the exact values of the integers. Therefore, we can't determine the exact value of `even_count`. However, we can describe the output state as follows:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`.**
