The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst` and the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from `lst`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return the total number of pairs of even and odd integers that can be chosen from the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers, returns the total number of pairs of even and odd integers that can be chosen from the list.**
