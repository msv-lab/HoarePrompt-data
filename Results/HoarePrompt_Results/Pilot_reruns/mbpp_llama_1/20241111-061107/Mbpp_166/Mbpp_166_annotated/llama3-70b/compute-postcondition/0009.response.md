To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 3
- `count` is 1

The given Python code snippet is:
```
count += 1
```

Now, let's think step by step:
- The value of `count` is incremented by 1.
- The previous value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` is 2.
- The states of the other variables (`nums`, `i`, `j`) are not affected.

Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `count` is 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `count` is 2**
