The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
