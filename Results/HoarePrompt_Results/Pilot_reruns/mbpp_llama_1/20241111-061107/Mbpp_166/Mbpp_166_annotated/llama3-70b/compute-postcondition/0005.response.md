To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `nums` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `nums` must have at least 3 elements to ensure that the loop can execute again.

The state of `count` does not affect the loop condition, so it remains the same.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is 1 or 0**
