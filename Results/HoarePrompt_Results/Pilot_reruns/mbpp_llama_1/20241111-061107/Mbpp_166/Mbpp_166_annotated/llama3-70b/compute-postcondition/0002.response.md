To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to start. The loop iterates over a range that starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `len(nums)`. For this loop to execute at least once, `i + 1` must be less than `len(nums)`, which means `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. Since `i` is 0, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

Here's the breakdown:

- `nums` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 0, which is less than the required length for the loop to execute.
- `j` will start from `i + 1`, which is 1, and will iterate over the indices of `nums` starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
