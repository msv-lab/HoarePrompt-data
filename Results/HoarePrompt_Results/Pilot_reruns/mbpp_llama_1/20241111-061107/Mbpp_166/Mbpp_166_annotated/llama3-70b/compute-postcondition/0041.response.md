Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` as input. The function iterates over all pairs of elements in `nums` and checks if the bitwise XOR of each pair is even. If the bitwise XOR is even, it increments a counter `count`. After iterating over all pairs, the function returns the total count of pairs with even bitwise XOR.

The annotations mention that if `nums` is empty or has only one element, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0. This is correct, as the loop only iterates over pairs of elements, and there are no pairs in an empty or single-element list.

However, the annotations do not mention what happens if `nums` contains duplicate elements. In this case, the function will still count the pairs with even bitwise XOR, even if the pairs contain duplicate elements.

Additionally, the annotations do not mention what happens if `nums` contains non-integer elements. In this case, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to perform bitwise XOR on non-integer elements.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the count of pairs with even bitwise XOR. If `nums` is empty or has only one element, the function returns 0. If `nums` contains duplicate elements, the function still counts the pairs with even bitwise XOR. If `nums` contains non-integer elements, the function raises a TypeError. **
