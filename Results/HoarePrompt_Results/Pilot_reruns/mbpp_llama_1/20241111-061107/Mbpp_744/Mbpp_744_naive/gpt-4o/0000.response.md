Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a given tuple contains any `None` value. The function iterates over each item in the tuple, and if it finds a `None` value, it immediately returns `True`. If it iterates over the entire tuple without finding a `None` value, it returns `False`.

The function correctly handles tuples of any length, including empty tuples, and it correctly identifies tuples that contain `None` values. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness.

I couldn't find any potential case where the function does not work as expected. The function's logic is straightforward and correctly implemented, making it correct for all possible inputs.
