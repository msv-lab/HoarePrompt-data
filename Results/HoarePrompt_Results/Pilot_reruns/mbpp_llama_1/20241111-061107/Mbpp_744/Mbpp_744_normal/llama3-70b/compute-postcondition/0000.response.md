The function returns the result of `any(x is None for x in tup)`, which checks if any element in the tuple `tup` is `None`. The state of `tup` is not changed, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple, and the function returns `True` if any element in `tup` is `None`, otherwise `False`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, and the function returns `True` if any element in `tup` is `None`, otherwise `False`.**
