According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 1 item, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state only mentions that `tup` is a tuple, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `tup` has at least 1 item and `item` is the first item in the tuple.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the tuple**
