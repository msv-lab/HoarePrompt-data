Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to accurately implement the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a given tuple contains any `None` values and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise. This behavior matches the problem description.

The annotations provided help to understand the code's behavior, especially in edge cases. For example, the annotation mentions that if the tuple is empty, the function does not return `True` explicitly, which is correct because the function returns `False` in this case. The annotation also mentions that if the function returns `True`, `item` is the first `None` element encountered in the tuple, which is consistent with the code's behavior.

I used the annotations to double-check the code's behavior in edge cases, such as an empty tuple or a tuple with no `None` values. The annotations helped me to understand that the code handles these cases correctly.

The problem description does not provide any examples, but based on the code and annotations, I believe that the function will work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3)`, the function will return `False` because there are no `None` values. If the input tuple is `(1, None, 3)`, the function will return `True` because it contains a `None` value. If the input tuple is `()`, the function will return `False` because it is empty.

Overall, I believe that the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
