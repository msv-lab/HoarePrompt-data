To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element.
- `item` is the first element in the tuple.

Loop Statement:
```
for item in tup:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the tuple `tup`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `tup` after the current `item`.

Adjustments:
- Since `item` is currently the first element in the tuple, for the loop to execute again, `item` should be adjusted to be the second element in the tuple.
- The tuple `tup` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in the tuple.**
