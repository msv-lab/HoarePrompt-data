The function returns `True`, and `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, and `item` is the third element in the tuple. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in the tuple, and the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in the tuple, and the function returns `True`**
