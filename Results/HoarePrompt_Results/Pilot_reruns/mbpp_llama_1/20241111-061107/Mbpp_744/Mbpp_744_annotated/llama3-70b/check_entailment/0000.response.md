Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the code and the problem description, and I believe the code meets the requirements. The function `func_1` takes a tuple as input and returns `True` if any element in the tuple is `None`, and `False` otherwise.

The code uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is `None`. This is a concise and efficient way to perform the check.

The annotations provided are consistent with the code and the problem description. They state that the function returns `True` if any element in the tuple is `None`, and `False` otherwise, including cases where the tuple is empty or contains only non-None values.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* A tuple with a single `None` element: The function should return `True`.
* A tuple with multiple `None` elements: The function should return `True`.
* A tuple with no `None` elements: The function should return `False`.
* An empty tuple: The function should return `False`.

In all these cases, the code behaves as expected. I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing a clear summary of the function's behavior and highlighting the edge cases that the function should handle. However, I double-checked the annotations against the code and the problem description to ensure that they are accurate and consistent.

Overall, I believe the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
