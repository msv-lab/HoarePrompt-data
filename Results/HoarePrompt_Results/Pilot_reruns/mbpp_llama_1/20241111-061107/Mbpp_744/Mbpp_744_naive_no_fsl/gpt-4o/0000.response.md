Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates over each item in the input tuple and checks if it is `None`. If it finds a `None` value, it immediately returns `True`. If it iterates over the entire tuple without finding a `None` value, it returns `False`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Tuples with at least one `None` value
* Tuples with no `None` values
* Tuples with a mix of `None` and non-`None` values
* Tuples with only one element, which may or may not be `None`

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program, as they cover different scenarios and the program passes all of them.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
