The given code snippet creates a new dictionary with the same keys as `student_data`, but only includes the key-value pairs where the height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The function then returns this new dictionary.

The state of the variables does not change, so `student_data` remains the same, and `min_height` and `min_weight` are still floats. However, the function returns a new dictionary that includes only the students who meet the minimum height and weight requirements.

Output State: **`student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a string and each value is a tuple of two floats, `min_height` is a float, `min_weight` is a float, and the function returns a dictionary with filtered student data**
