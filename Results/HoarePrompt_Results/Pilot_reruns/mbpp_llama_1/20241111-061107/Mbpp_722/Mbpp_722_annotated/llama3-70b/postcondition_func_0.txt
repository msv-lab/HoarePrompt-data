The function accepts a dictionary `student_data` where each key is a string and each value is a tuple of two floats, and two float parameters `min_height` and `min_weight`. It filters the dictionary to include only items where the height and weight are greater than or equal to the minimum values, and returns the filtered dictionary. If `student_data` is empty, it returns an empty dictionary. If `min_height` or `min_weight` is not a float, it raises a TypeError. If the values in `student_data` are not tuples of two floats, it raises a TypeError.
