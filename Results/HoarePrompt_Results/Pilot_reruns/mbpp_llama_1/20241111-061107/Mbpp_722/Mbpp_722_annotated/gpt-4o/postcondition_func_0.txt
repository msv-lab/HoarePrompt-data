The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` with string keys and float tuple values, and two float parameters `min_height` and `min_weight`, and returns a new dictionary with filtered student data. The filtering condition is based on the height and weight of each student, and the function does not handle cases where `student_dict` is empty, `min_height` or `min_weight` is not a float, or `student_dict` contains students with missing or invalid data.
