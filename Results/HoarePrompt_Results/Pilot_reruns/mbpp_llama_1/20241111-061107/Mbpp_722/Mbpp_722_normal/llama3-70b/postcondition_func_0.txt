The function accepts a dictionary `student_data` with student names as keys and tuples of (height, weight) as values, and minimum height and weight requirements `min_height` and `min_weight`. It returns a dictionary with students who meet the minimum height and weight requirements. If `student_data` is not a dictionary, the function raises an `AttributeError`. If `min_height` or `min_weight` is not a number, the function raises a `TypeError`. If a student's height or weight is not a number, the function raises a `TypeError`.
