The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` and two float parameters `min_height` and `min_weight`, and returns a dictionary containing only the items from `student_dict` where the height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If `student_dict` is empty, the function returns an empty dictionary. The function assumes that the values in `student_dict` are tuples of two floats and the keys are strings, but does not check these assumptions. If these assumptions are not met, the function may raise a TypeError.
