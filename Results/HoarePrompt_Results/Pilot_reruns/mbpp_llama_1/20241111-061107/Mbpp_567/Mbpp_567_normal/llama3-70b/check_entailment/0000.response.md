I'll make an initial assessment based on the code and the problem description.

The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The code provided is:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return all((lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1)))
```
At first glance, the code seems to be correct. It checks if each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element, which is the definition of a sorted list in non-decreasing order.

However, I can think of one edge case that might not be handled correctly: an empty list. An empty list is technically sorted, but the code might raise an error when trying to access the first element.

Now, let's look at the output hints:
```python
The function accepts a list `lst` and returns `True` if the list is in non-decreasing order (including empty lists and lists with duplicate elements), and `False` otherwise. However, if the list contains non-comparable elements, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
```
The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the behavior of the function. They confirm that the function returns `True` for empty lists, which addresses my initial concern.

After re-examining the code and output hints, I conclude that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order, including edge cases such as empty lists and lists with duplicate elements. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, and I couldn't find any examples where the program does not work as expected.
