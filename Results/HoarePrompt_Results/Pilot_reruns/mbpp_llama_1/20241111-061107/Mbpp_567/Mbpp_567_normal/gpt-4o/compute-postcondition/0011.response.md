To calculate the output state, we consider the initial state and the given Python code snippet. The initial state describes the behavior of a loop that checks if a list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the code snippet is a return statement that returns `True`.

Given that the loop's behavior is already defined in the initial state, the return statement `return True` indicates that the function or method is returning a value of `True`, regardless of the state of the loop or the list `lst`. This return statement does not depend on the loop's execution or the values of `i` and `lst`.

Therefore, the output state is that the function returns `True`, and this return statement does not change the state of `i` or `lst`, which are defined by the loop's behavior before the return statement.

Output State: **The function returns True**
