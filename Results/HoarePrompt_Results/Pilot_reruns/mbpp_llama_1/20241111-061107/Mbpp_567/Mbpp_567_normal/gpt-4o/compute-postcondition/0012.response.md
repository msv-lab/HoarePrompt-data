The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. After executing the function body, if `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order and has at least 2 elements, the function returns True. If `lst` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, the function returns False as soon as it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the function returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of comparable elements `lst` and return whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of comparable elements lst, returns `False` if `lst` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise returns `True`.**
