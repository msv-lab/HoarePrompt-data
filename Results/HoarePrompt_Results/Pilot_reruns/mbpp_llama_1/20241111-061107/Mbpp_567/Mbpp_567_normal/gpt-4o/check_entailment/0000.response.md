Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds a pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This approach matches the problem description.

After examining the output hints, I can see that they agree with the code. The hints state that the function returns `False` if the list has at least 2 elements and is not sorted in non-decreasing order, and returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order or has less than 2 elements, including empty lists. This matches the behavior of the code.

I couldn't find any edge cases that the code is not handling. The code correctly handles lists with less than 2 elements, including empty lists, and it correctly checks for non-decreasing order.

The unit tests provided also suggest that the code is correct. The tests cover various cases, including sorted and unsorted lists, and the code passes all the tests.

Therefore, my conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description by checking if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It handles all edge cases, including lists with less than 2 elements, and it passes all the provided unit tests.
