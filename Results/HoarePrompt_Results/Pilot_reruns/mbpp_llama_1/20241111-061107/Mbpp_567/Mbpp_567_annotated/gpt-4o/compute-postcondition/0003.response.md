According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst`. If `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `lst` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Additionally, since the function did not return `False`, it means the first element of `lst` is not greater than the second element. However, this condition is not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust it. 

State: **`lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
