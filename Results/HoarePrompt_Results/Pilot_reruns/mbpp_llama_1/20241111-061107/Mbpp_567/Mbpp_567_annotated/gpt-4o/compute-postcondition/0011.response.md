Based on the initial state, the loop has already checked the list `lst` and has not returned `False`, which means `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The loop has completed without returning a value, and `i` is `len(lst) - 2`. Now, the code executes `return True`.

The function returns `True`, indicating that the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is the same as before, with the additional information that the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, and the function returns `True`.**
