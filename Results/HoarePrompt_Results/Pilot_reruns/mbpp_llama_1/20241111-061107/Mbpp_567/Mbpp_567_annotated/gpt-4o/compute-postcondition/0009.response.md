To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `lst` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.

Loop statement:
```python
for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, and assuming the loop body does not modify `lst` or `i` in a way that affects the loop condition directly, we need to ensure that `len(lst) - 1` is at least 3 to allow `i` to increment to 3 and still be within the loop's range.

However, the condition for the loop to continue is not dependent on the comparison of elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` but rather on the range defined by `len(lst) - 1`. Therefore, the adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is solely based on the value of `i` and the length of `lst`.

Since `i` is 2 and we know `lst` has at least 3 elements, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `lst` must have at least 4 elements to satisfy the loop condition (`i < len(lst) - 1`).

State: **`lst` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3**
