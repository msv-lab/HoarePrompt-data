Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the provided code and annotations, and I believe that the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by using the `all` function with a generator expression that compares each element in the list with its next element. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The annotations provide additional information about the function's behavior, including its handling of empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists containing non-comparable elements. The annotations state that the function returns `True` for empty lists and lists with a single element, which is consistent with the code's behavior. The annotations also mention that the function raises a `TypeError` if the list contains non-comparable elements, which is also consistent with the code's behavior, as the comparison `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]` would raise a `TypeError` if the elements are not comparable.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: The function returns `True`, which is correct.
* Lists with a single element: The function returns `True`, which is correct.
* Lists with multiple elements in non-decreasing order: The function returns `True`, which is correct.
* Lists with multiple elements in decreasing order: The function returns `False`, which is correct.
* Lists containing non-comparable elements: The function raises a `TypeError`, which is consistent with the annotations.

In all cases, the code's behavior matches the problem description and the annotations. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.
