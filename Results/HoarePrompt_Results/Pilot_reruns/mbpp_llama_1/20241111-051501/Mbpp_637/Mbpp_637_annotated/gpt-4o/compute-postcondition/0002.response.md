Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, which are expected to be numbers. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`.

Looking at the code, it simply returns the result of the comparison `cost_price == selling_price`. This means that the function will return `True` if the two prices are equal, and `False` otherwise.

There are no potential edge cases or missing logic in this code. The function behaves as expected for all possible inputs.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle non-numeric inputs. If `cost_price` or `selling_price` are not numbers, the function will raise a TypeError. This is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations, but it's an important aspect of the function's behavior.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two numeric parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are equal. If either parameter is non-numeric, the function raises a TypeError. **
