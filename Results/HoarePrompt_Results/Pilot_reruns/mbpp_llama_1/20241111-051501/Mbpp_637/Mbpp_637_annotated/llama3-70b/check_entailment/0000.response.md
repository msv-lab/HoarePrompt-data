Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the problem description, which is to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. The function `func_1` takes two numeric parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.

The annotations provided accurately describe the behavior of the code and do not introduce any hallucinated cases. The annotation states that the function assumes both inputs are numbers and does not handle non-numeric inputs. However, this is not a requirement in the problem description, and the code is still correct within the scope of the problem.

The code correctly handles all potential cases where the cost price and selling price are equal (no profit and no loss) or not equal (profit or loss). There are no edge cases that the code does not cover, and the annotations do not reveal any potential issues.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description, and I couldn't find any examples where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
