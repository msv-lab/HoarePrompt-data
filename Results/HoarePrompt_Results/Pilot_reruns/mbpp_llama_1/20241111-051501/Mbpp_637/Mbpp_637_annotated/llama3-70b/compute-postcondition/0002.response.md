Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, which are both numbers. The function returns `True` if `cost_price` equals `selling_price`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Upon examining the code, I notice that the function simply checks if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price` using the `==` operator and returns the result. There are no additional checks or calculations performed.

Considering potential edge cases, I note that the function does not handle non-numeric inputs. If either `cost_price` or `selling_price` is not a number, the function may raise a TypeError or produce unexpected results.

Another edge case to consider is the comparison of floating-point numbers. Due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic, two numbers that are mathematically equal may not be exactly equal when represented as floats. However, the `==` operator in Python performs a exact equality check, so this may not be a significant concern in this case.

Overall, the functionality of the function is to compare two numbers, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two numeric parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. The function assumes that both inputs are numbers and does not handle non-numeric inputs. **
