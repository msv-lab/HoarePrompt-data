Let's analyze the function step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, both of which are numbers. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`.

Looking at the code, we can see that it simply returns the result of the comparison `cost_price == selling_price`. This means that the function will return `True` if the two prices are equal and `False` otherwise.

There are no potential edge cases or missing logic in this function. The function behaves as expected for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two numeric parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are equal. **
