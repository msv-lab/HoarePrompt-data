Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, which are expected to be numbers.

The code simply returns `True` if `cost_price` equals `selling_price`, and `False` otherwise.

Looking at the code, it seems to do exactly what the annotations say. There are no potential edge cases or missing logic that I can see.

However, I do notice that the annotations and the code do not specify what happens if `cost_price` or `selling_price` are not numbers. In Python, comparing non-numeric values using `==` will not raise an error, but will instead return `False`. Therefore, I will include this in the functionality.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. If either `cost_price` or `selling_price` are not numbers, the function will still return `False`. **
