Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function `func_1(n: int) -> int` is supposed to find the last digit in the factorial of a given number `n`. However, the function only handles cases where `n` is less than or equal to 4, and returns 0 for all `n` greater than 4.

A counterexample is when `n = 5`. The factorial of 5 is 120, and the last digit is 0. However, the function will return 0 for all `n` greater than 4, without actually calculating the factorial.

In fact, the function does not calculate the factorial at all, and its return values are hardcoded for specific values of `n`. This means that the function will not work correctly for any `n` greater than 4.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should calculate the factorial of `n` and return the last digit. One possible implementation could use the modulo operator to efficiently calculate the last digit of the factorial.
