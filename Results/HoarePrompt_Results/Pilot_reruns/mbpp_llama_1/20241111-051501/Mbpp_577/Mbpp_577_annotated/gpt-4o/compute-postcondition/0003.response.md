The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return either 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, or the last digit of the factorial of `n` if `n` is less than 5.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n, returns 0 if n is greater than or equal to 5, otherwise returns the last digit of the factorial of n.**
