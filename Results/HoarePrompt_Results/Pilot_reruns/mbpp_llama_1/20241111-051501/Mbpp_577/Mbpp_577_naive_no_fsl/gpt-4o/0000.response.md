Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`. 

For `n >= 5`, the last digit of the factorial is always 0, because the factorial will contain the factors 5 and 2, which contribute a factor of 10 to the factorial. Therefore, the function correctly returns 0 for `n >= 5`.

For `n < 5`, the function calculates the factorial using a loop and returns the last digit of the result using the modulo operator (`% 10`). This is a correct way to calculate the last digit of the factorial.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works correctly for the tested inputs. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
