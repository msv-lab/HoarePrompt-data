Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

The program uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. This function correctly checks if a number is less than 2 (in which case it is not prime) and then checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is a well-known optimization for prime checks.

The main function `func_1` then iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (exclusive) and uses the `is_prime` function to count the number of prime numbers in this range.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles edge cases such as:

* `n = 0`: returns 0, since there are no prime numbers less than 0.
* `n = 1`: returns 0, since there are no prime numbers less than 1.
* `n = 2`: returns 0, since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
* `n = 3`: returns 1, since there is one prime number (2) less than 3.
* `n = 10`: returns 4, since there are four prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7) less than 10.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
