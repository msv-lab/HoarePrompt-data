The code `is_prime[j] = False` changes the value of the `j`-th element in the `is_prime` list to `False`. The initial state of `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`. The value of `j` is 4.

So, the `j`-th element in the `is_prime` list, which is at index 4, is changed to `False`. The other elements in the `is_prime` list remain the same.

The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 5, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
