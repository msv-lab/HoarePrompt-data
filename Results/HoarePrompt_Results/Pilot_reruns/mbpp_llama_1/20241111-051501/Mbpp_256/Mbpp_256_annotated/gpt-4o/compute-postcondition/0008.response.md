Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `is_prime[j] = False` sets the value of the element at index `j` in the `is_prime` list to `False`. Since `j` is 6, this means the element at index 6 in the `is_prime` list is set to `False`.

Initially, the element at index 6 was `True`, but now it becomes `False`.

The other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 6, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is at least 6, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
