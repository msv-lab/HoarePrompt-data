To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the for loop statement. The loop iterates over the range `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 9, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 9. To execute the loop again, the next value of `j` should be the next multiple of `i` greater than 9. Since `i` is 3, the next multiple of `i` is 12. 

Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 12. The state of `n` being greater than 9 is sufficient to ensure the loop can execute again, so it doesn't need to be adjusted. The state of `is_prime` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[9]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 12**
