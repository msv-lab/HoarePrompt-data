To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

The current state is:
* `n` is greater than 3
* `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values
* `i` is 4
* `j` is the last multiple of 3 that is less than `n`

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range. Since `i` is currently 4, the next value would be 5.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is still greater than 3.

The state of `is_prime` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not dependent on the loop condition.

The state of `j` needs to be adjusted, as it is now the last multiple of 4 that is less than `n`, not the last multiple of 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, `i` is 5, `j` is the last multiple of 4 that is less than `n`**
