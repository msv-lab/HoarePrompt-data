Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `is_prime = [True] * n` creates a list of boolean values, where all elements are initially set to `True`. The length of the list is determined by the value of `n`.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the list `is_prime` will have a length of `n`. If `n` is 0, the list will be empty. If `n` is 1 or 2, the list will have one or two elements, respectively, all set to `True`.

The output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to `True`.**
