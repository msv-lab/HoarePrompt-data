To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement:

```
for j in range(i * i, n, i):
```

The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` starts at `i * i` and increments by `i` each time, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and `n` is greater than 9. Since `j` is 12, the next value of `j` will be `12 + 3 = 15`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Since `j` will be 15, `n` should be greater than 15.

The state of `is_prime` does not affect the loop execution, so it remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 15, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[9]` is `False` and `is_prime[12]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 15**
