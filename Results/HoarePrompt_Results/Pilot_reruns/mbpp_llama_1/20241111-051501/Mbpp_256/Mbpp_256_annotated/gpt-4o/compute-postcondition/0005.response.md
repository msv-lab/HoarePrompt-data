To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the for loop statement.


The loop iterates over a range that starts at `i * i`, ends at `n`, and increments by `i` in each step. For the loop to execute, the starting point `i * i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 3, the condition is already satisfied because `2 * 2 = 4`, which is less than `n`. However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 5, so `i * i` (which is 4) is less than `n` and the loop has at least one iteration.


Additionally, `j` needs to be initialized to the first value in the range, which is `i * i`.


The state of `is_prime` does not directly affect the execution of the loop but is part of the overall program state.


State: **`n` is at least 5, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
