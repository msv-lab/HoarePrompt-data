To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to start. The loop iterates over a range that starts at `i * i`, ends at `n`, and increments by `i`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the conditions for the loop to execute:

1. **`i` is 3**: This is given, so `i` is already defined and has a value that can be used in the loop condition.

2. **`n` is greater than 3**: This is also given, which means `n` is at least 4. Since `i` is 3, `i * i` equals 9. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 9 because the loop starts at `i * i` (which is 9) and goes up to `n`. If `n` were less than or equal to 9, the loop would not execute because there would be no iterations in the range from 9 to `n`.

3. **`is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values**: This state is already defined and does not directly affect the loop's execution condition. However, it's essential for understanding the context in which the loop operates.

Given these considerations, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 9 (since `i * i` equals 9) and that `j` starts at `i * i`, which is 9. The state of `is_prime` and its specific values does not directly influence the loop's execution condition but is part of the overall program state.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
