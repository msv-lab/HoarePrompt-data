To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is `range(i * i, n, i)`, which means the loop will iterate over the values of `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `n` is at least 5.

For the loop to execute again, the value of `j` should be the next value in the range. Since the step is `i` (which is 2), the next value of `j` should be 4 + 2 = 6.

However, since `n` is at least 5, the loop will not execute again because 6 is greater than `n`. But to make the loop execute again, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 6.

Additionally, since `j` is now 6, we need to adjust the state of `is_prime` to reflect that the element at index 6 is `True` (or not, depending on the actual prime number check, but for the sake of this exercise, we'll assume it's `True`).

The state of `i` remains the same, as it's not affected by the loop condition.

State: **`n` is at least 6, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `True`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
