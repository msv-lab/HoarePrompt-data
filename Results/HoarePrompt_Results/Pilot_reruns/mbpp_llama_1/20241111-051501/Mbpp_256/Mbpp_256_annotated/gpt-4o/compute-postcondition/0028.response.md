To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The code is `is_prime[j] = False`. This line of code sets the value of `is_prime` at index `j` to `False`.

2. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `j`. It only mentions that `i` is 4, but `j` is not mentioned. 

3. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine which index of `is_prime` is being set to `False`. The only index we know the value of is `is_prime[16]`, which is `False`.

4. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime[16]` is `False`, and an unknown index of `is_prime` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime[16]` is `False`, and an unknown index of `is_prime` is `False`**
