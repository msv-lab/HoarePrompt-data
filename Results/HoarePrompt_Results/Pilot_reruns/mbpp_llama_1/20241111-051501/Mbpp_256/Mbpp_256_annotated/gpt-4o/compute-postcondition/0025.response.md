To ensure the loop can execute, we need to analyze the loop statement and adjust the state accordingly.


The loop statement is `for j in range(i * i, n, i):`. This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`.


Given the initial state: `n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, `i` is 4, `j` is the last multiple of 3 that is less than `n`. 


For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i * i` is less than `n`, because the range function in Python generates numbers from the start value up to but not including the stop value. 


Also, since `j` is the last multiple of 3 that is less than `n`, it's not directly related to the loop execution. However, since `j` is mentioned in the state, we should adjust its value to be within the range of the loop. But since the loop starts from `i * i`, we should adjust `j` to be the first value in the range, which is `i * i`.


State: **`n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, `i` is 4, `i * i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i * i`**
