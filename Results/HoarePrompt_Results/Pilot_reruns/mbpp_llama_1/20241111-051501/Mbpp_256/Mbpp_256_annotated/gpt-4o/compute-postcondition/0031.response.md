To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `range(i * i, n, i)`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of numbers starting from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.

From the current state, we know that `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 16, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[20]` is `False`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by `i` (which is 4) and still be within the range of `i * i` to `n`. 

Since `i` is 4, the next value of `j` would be 24 (20 + 4). 

Also, since `n` is greater than 16, it must be greater than or equal to 24 for the loop to execute again. 

Other states like `is_prime[16]` being `False` and an unknown index of `is_prime` being `False` do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 24, `i` is 4, `is_prime[16]` is `False`, an unknown index of `is_prime` is `False`, `j` is 24, and `is_prime[20]` is `False`.**
