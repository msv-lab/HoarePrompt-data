To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given state.

The loop condition is `i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `num` is greater than or equal to 16
* `i` is 4

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next value in the range, which is 5. Additionally, the upper bound of the range, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, must be greater than or equal to 5.

Since `num` is greater than or equal to 16, its square root is greater than or equal to 4. To ensure the loop executes again, the square root of `num` must be greater than or equal to 5. This means `num` must be greater than or equal to 25.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `num` is greater than or equal to 25
* `i` is 5

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 25, `i` is 5**
