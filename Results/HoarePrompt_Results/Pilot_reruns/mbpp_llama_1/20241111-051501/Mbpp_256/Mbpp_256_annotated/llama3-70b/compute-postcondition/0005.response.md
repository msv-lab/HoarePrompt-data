According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than the square root of `num` plus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `num` is greater than 4.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `num` needs to be adjusted to ensure that its square root plus 1 is greater than 3. Since `num` is greater than 4, its square root plus 1 is already greater than 3, so `num` does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num` is greater than 4, `i` is 3**
