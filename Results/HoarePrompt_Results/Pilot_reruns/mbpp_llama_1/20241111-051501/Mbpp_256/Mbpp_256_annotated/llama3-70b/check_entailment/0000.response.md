Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should return the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. However, the code incorrectly returns 0 if the input number is exactly 2.

According to the annotations, Function 1 returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, but incorrectly returns 0 if `n` is exactly 2. This is because 2 is a prime number, and the function should return 1 in this case.

For example, if the input is 2, the function should return 1, but it returns 0. This is a case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description.

Additionally, the annotations also mention that Function 2 returns `True` if `num` is 2 or 3, which is correct. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the program, as the issue lies in Function 1.
