Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`. The function uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.

The `is_prime` function correctly checks if a number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number, which is an optimization over checking all the way up to the number itself.

The main function `func_1` then iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (exclusive) and uses the `is_prime` function to check if each number is prime. If a number is prime, it increments the count.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 0, and when `n` is 2, in which case it returns 0, since there are no prime numbers less than 2.

The function also correctly handles the case when `n` is a large number, since the `is_prime` function uses an efficient algorithm to check for primality.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all non-negative inputs.
