To ensure the loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions that must be met based on the loop statement: `for j in range(i * i, n, i):`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 16
- `i` is 4
- `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`. If `n` is greater than 9, the `is_prime` list will have its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 9 to `n`, with the remaining elements (except those set to `False` by the loop) being `True`. If `n` is 9 or less, the `is_prime` list remains unchanged except for the first two elements being `False`.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `i * i` must be less than `n` because the range starts from `i * i` and goes up to `n`. Given `i` is 4, `i * i` equals 16, which is less than or equal to `n` (since `n` is greater than or equal to 16), but for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 16.
2. `i` must be a valid step value, which it is, as it's a positive integer.

Considering these conditions, we adjust the state as follows:
- `n` must be greater than 16 for the loop to execute.
- `i` remains 4, as it's already set.
- `j` starts at `i * i`, which is 16.
- The state of `is_prime` list remains as initially described, but since `n` is greater than 9, its elements are set to `False` for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 9 to `n`, with the remaining elements being `True`, except for the first two elements which are `False`.

State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, and elements at indices that are multiples of 3 from 9 to `n` are `False`, with the rest being `True`**
