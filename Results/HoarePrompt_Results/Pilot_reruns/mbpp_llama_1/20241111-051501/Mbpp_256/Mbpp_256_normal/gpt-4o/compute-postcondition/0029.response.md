To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i * i, n, i):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the values of `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 4, `j` is 20, `n` is greater than 16, and `is_prime` is a list of `n` values with certain properties.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to find the next value of `j` that satisfies the loop condition. Since `j` starts from `i * i` and increments by `i`, the next value of `j` would be `20 + 4 = 24`.

However, we also need to ensure that `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 16, we can conclude that `n` is also greater than 24. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted.

The state of `is_prime` does not affect the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted either.

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be set to the next value in the range, which is 24.

State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, elements at indices that are multiples of 3 from 9 to `n` are `False`, the element at index 16 is `False`, the element at index 20 is `False`, and the rest are `True`.**
