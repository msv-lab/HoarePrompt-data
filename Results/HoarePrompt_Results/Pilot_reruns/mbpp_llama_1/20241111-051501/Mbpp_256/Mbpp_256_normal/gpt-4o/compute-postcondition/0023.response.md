Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, and `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`. If `n` is greater than 9, the `is_prime` list will have its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 9 to `n`, with the remaining elements (except those set to `False` by the loop) being `True`. If `n` is 9 or less, the `is_prime` list remains unchanged except for the first two elements being `False`.***
