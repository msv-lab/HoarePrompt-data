To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i * i, n, i):`. This means that `j` will take on values from `i * i` to `n-1`, incrementing by `i` each time.

Currently, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 6, and `j` is 6. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by `i` (which is 2) and still be less than `n`. So, the new value of `j` should be 8. 

However, we also need to ensure that `n` is greater than the new value of `j`, which is 8. Therefore, `n` should be greater than 8.

The state of `is_prime` does not affect the loop execution, so it remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 8, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, the sixth element is `True`, the seventh element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 8**
