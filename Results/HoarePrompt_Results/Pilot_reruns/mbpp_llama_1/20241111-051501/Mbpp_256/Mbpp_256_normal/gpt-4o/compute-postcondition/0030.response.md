The code `is_prime[j] = False` sets the value of `is_prime` at index `j` to `False`. Since `j` is 24, this changes the value of `is_prime[24]` from `True` to `False`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, elements at indices that are multiples of 3 from 9 to `n` are `False`, the element at index 16 is `False`, the element at index 20 is `False`, the element at index 24 is `False`, and the rest are `True`.**
