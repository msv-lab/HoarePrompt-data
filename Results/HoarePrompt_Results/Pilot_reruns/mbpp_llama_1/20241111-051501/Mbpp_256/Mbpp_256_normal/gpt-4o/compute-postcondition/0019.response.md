To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the for loop statement.

The loop iterates over the range `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. This means that the loop will execute again if the current value of `j` is less than `n` and the next value of `j` can be calculated by adding `i` to the current value of `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 12, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 12. To determine the next value of `j`, we add `i` to the current value of `j`, which gives us 15.

Since 15 is less than `n` (which is greater than 12), the loop can execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to 15.

The state of `is_prime` list does not need to be adjusted, as it is not directly related to the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, and the `is_prime` list has its first two elements set to `False`, the 10th element set to `False`, and the 12th element set to `False`, while the remaining elements (except the 10th and 12th) are `True`.**
