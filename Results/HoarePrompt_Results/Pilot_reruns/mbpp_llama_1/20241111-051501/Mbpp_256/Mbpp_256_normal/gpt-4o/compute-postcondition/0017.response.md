To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is `range(i * i, n, i)`, which means the loop will iterate over the values of `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, `n` is greater than 9, and the `is_prime` list has its 10th element set to `False`, while the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements (except the 10th) are `True`.

To determine if the loop will execute again, we need to check if there are any remaining values in the range `range(i * i, n, i)`.

Since `i` is 3, the next value of `j` would be `i * i + i = 3 * 3 + 3 = 12`. However, since `n` is greater than 9, it's possible that `n` is less than 12, which would mean the loop would not execute again.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 12.

Additionally, since `j` is 9 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment it to the next value in the range, which is 12.

The state of the `is_prime` list does not affect the loop condition, so it remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and the `is_prime` list has its 10th element set to `False`, while the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements (except the 10th) are `True`.**
