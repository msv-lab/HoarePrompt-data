The code `is_prime[j] = False` assigns `False` to the `j`-th index of the `is_prime` list. Since `j` is 15, this operation affects the 15th element of the `is_prime` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, and the `is_prime` list has its first two elements set to `False`, the 10th element set to `False`, the 12th element set to `False`, and the 15th element set to `False`, while the remaining elements (except the 10th, 12th, and 15th) are `True`.**
