Based on the loop code and the initial state, I will determine the loop's output state.

The loop appears to be implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark composite numbers in the `is_prime` list. The outer loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, and the inner loop marks multiples of `i` as non-prime.

Output State: **The loop marks composite numbers in the `is_prime` list by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and marking multiples of each prime number as non-prime. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with all elements being `True`. If `n` is 2 or 3, the loop does not execute and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with the first two elements being `False` and the remaining elements being `True`. For `n` greater than 3, the `is_prime` list will have its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n`, with the remaining elements being `True`. The value of `i` will be the last prime number checked, which is the largest prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`.**
