Based on the initial state, the `is_prime` list contains boolean values representing whether each number up to `n` is prime or not. The loop has already marked composite numbers by setting their corresponding elements in the `is_prime` list to `False`.

The `return sum(is_prime)` statement calculates the sum of all elements in the `is_prime` list, which effectively counts the number of prime numbers up to `n`.

Since the `is_prime` list has been updated based on the value of `n`, the sum will be different depending on the value of `n`. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact sum.

Therefore, the output state is: The function returns the count of prime numbers up to `n`, `i` is the largest prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with its updated values.

Output State: **The function returns the count of prime numbers up to `n`, `i` is the largest prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with its updated values.**
