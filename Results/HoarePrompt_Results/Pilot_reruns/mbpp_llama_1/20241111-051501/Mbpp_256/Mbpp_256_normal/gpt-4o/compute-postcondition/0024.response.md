To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

Currently, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented, and the condition `i` ≤ √`n` must still be true.

Since `i` is 3, incrementing it will make `i` = 4. The condition `i` ≤ √`n` will still be true if √`n` ≥ 4. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 16 (since √16 = 4).

The state of `is_prime` does not affect the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, and `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`. If `n` is greater than 9, the `is_prime` list will have its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 9 to `n`, with the remaining elements (except those set to `False` by the loop) being `True`. If `n` is 9 or less, the `is_prime` list remains unchanged except for the first two elements being `False`.**
