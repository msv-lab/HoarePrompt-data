To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

Current state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 16
- `i` is 4
- `is_prime` is a list of `n` values with the first two elements being `False`. If `n` is greater than 9, the list has its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 9 to `n`. If `is_prime[i]` is `True`, the elements at indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` to `n` are also set to `False`, with the rest being `True`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, and the condition `i` <= `int(n ** 0.5)` must still be true.

Adjusted state:
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 16 (no change needed)
- `i` must be incremented to 5
- The `is_prime` list will be updated according to the loop body (not shown), but its structure and the conditions applied to it will remain the same.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5, and `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`. If `n` is greater than 9, the `is_prime` list will have its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 9 to `n`. If `is_prime[i]` is `True`, the elements at indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` to `n` are also set to `False`, with the rest being `True`.**
