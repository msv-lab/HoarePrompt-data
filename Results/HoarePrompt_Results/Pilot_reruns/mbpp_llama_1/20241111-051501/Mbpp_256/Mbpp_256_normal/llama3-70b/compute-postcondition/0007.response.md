Postcondition: ***`num` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3. If `num` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `num` is a multiple of 3), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return a value (i.e., it implicitly returns None or continues executing the next statements), with `num` and `i` retaining their original values.***
