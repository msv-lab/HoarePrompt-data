Output State: **The loop checks if a number `num` is a prime number by testing divisibility up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is divisible by any number `i` in the range from 2 to the square root of `num`, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any `i` in the range, the function does not explicitly return a value, implying that `num` is a prime number or has a prime factor greater than the square root of `num`. The loop does not execute if `num` is less than 2. After the loop executes, `num` remains unchanged, and `i` takes the value of the last number checked for divisibility, which is the square root of `num` rounded down to the nearest integer.**
