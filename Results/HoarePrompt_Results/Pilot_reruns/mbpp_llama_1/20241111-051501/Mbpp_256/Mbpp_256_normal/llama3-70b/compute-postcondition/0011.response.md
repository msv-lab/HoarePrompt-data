To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)`, which means the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`.

Currently, `i` is 4, and `num` is greater than or equal to 16.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 5, and `num` must still be greater than or equal to 25 (since 5 is less than or equal to the square root of 25).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 25, `i` is 5**
