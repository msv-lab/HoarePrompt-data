Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the volume using the correct mathematical formula: Ï€ * r^2 * h.

The program correctly uses the `math.pi` constant for the value of pi, and the exponentiation operator `**` to square the radius. The formula is correctly applied to calculate the volume, and the result is returned by the function.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* Positive values for radius and height
* Zero values for radius and/or height (which would result in a volume of zero)
* Negative values for radius and/or height (which would result in an incorrect result, but this is not a valid input for a cylinder's dimensions)
* Non-numeric values for radius and/or height (which would result in a TypeError, but this is not a valid input for a cylinder's dimensions)

In all valid cases, the program produces the correct result. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
