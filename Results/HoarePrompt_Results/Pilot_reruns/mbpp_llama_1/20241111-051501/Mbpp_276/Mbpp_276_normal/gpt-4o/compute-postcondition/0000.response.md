To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code step by step:

1. The code calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `πr²h`, where `r` is the radius and `h` is the height.
2. The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the value of pi.
3. The `radius` and `height` variables are used in the calculation, and their values are non-negative real numbers.
4. The result of the calculation is assigned to the `volume` variable.

Since the initial state specifies that `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, we can conclude that the calculated `volume` will also be a non-negative real number.

Output State: **`radius` is a non-negative real number, `height` is a non-negative real number, `volume` is a non-negative real number calculated as π times the square of `radius` times `height`.**
