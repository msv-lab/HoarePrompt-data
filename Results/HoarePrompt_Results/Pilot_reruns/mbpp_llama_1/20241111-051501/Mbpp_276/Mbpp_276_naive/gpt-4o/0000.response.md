Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula used, `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, is the standard formula for the volume of a cylinder. 

The function does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. The unit tests provided also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the function. 

The function assumes that the input values for radius and height are non-negative, which is a reasonable assumption for the dimensions of a physical cylinder. If negative values were passed to the function, it would still produce a mathematically correct result, but this might not be physically meaningful. However, this is not a reason to consider the function incorrect, as it is not specified in the problem description that the function should handle invalid input. 

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
