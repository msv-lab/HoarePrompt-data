Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks to add the given tuple to the given list, but the provided code does not modify the original list. Instead, it returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple. This is not exactly what the problem description says, which implies that the original list should be modified.

The annotations suggest that the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple, which is correct. However, this does not match the problem description. The annotations also mention that the function handles empty lists and tuples, and lists containing non-hashable elements correctly, but this is not relevant to the issue at hand.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the original list is expected to be modified. For example, if we have a list `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and a tuple `tpl = (4, 5, 6)`, the program will return a new list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, but the original list `lst` will remain unchanged.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing a clear understanding of what the code is intended to do, but they also highlighted the discrepancy between the code's behavior and the problem description.
