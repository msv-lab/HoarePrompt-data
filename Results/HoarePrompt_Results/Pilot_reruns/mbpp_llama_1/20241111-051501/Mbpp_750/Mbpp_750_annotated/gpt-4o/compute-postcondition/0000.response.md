The function returns the result of `lst + list(tpl)`. The `list()` function converts the tuple `tpl` to a list, and the `+` operator concatenates this list with `lst`. The state of `lst` and `tpl` does not change because they are not reassigned, so the output state is `lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns a list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns a list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`.**
