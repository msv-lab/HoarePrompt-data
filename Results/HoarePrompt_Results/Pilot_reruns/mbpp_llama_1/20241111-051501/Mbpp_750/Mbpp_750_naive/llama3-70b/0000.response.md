Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and returns a new list that is the result of adding the elements of the tuple to the list.

The program works by first converting the tuple to a list using the `list()` function, and then using the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists. This is a valid way to add the elements of a tuple to a list in Python.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles all possible inputs, including empty lists and tuples, and tuples with different data types. It also handles the case where the list and tuple are not empty.

For example, if we call the function with the following inputs:

`func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5, 6))`

The output will be:

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

Which is the expected result.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements in the problem description.
