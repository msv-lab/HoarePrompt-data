Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately adds the given tuple to the given list. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function, and then uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists. This results in a new list that contains all the elements from the original list followed by the elements from the tuple.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function works correctly for different inputs. I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected. The function handles tuples of any length and lists of any length, and it correctly adds the tuple elements to the end of the list.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
