The function returns the result of `lst + list(tpl)`. Since `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple, `list(tpl)` converts the tuple to a list. The `+` operator concatenates the two lists. The state of the variables `lst` and `tpl` remains unchanged, but the function returns the concatenated list.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `tpl` is a tuple, and the function returns a list which is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`**
