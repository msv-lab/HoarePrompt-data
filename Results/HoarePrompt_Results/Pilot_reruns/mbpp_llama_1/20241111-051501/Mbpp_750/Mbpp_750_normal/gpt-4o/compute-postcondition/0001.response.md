The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the function returns a list which is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that combines the elements of `lst` and `tpl`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`.**
