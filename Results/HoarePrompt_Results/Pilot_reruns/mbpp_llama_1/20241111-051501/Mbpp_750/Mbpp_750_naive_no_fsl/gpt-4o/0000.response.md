Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple converted to a list.

The program includes three assertions to test the function with different inputs. These assertions verify that the function behaves correctly for the given test cases.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected. The function correctly handles the conversion of the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list. The assertions provided also cover different scenarios, and the function passes all of them.

The function is designed to work with any list and tuple, regardless of their contents or lengths. The use of the `+` operator to concatenate the lists is a standard and efficient way to combine lists in Python.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
