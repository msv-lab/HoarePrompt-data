The function accepts a complex number `c` and returns its absolute value and phase. However, it does not perform input validation, and may raise a TypeError or produce unexpected results if `c` is not a complex number. Additionally, if `c` is a zero complex number, the function may return `nan` or raise a ValueError for the phase value.
