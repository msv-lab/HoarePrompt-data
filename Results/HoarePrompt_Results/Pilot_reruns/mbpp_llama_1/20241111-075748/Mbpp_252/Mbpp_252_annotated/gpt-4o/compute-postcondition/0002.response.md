The function func_1 accepts a complex number num and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number.

However, the code does not explicitly check if the input num is indeed a complex number. If num is not a complex number, the function will still attempt to calculate its magnitude and phase angle, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Additionally, the code does not handle potential edge cases, such as when num is zero or infinite.

Considering these potential issues, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a number, attempts to treat it as a complex number, and returns a tuple containing its magnitude and phase angle, but may produce unexpected results or errors if the input is not a valid complex number or if it is zero or infinite. **
