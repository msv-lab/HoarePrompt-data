Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the conversion of complex numbers to polar coordinates for all potential cases. The function `func_1` expects a single number as input, but it does not handle cases where the input is a complex number with both real and imaginary parts.

For example, if the input is a complex number like `3+4j`, the function will throw an error because it cannot convert the complex number to a single number. The correct implementation should accept a complex number as input and return its polar coordinates.

Additionally, the unit tests provided only cover cases where the input is a real number, and do not test the function's behavior with complex numbers. A correct implementation should include tests for complex numbers as well.

To fix this, the function should be modified to accept a complex number as input, and the unit tests should be updated to cover a wider range of cases. For example:

```python
import cmath

def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(num)

assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(3+4j) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)
```
