Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `c` and returns a tuple containing two values. 

According to the annotations, `c` is a complex number, and the function returns a tuple containing the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`. 

Looking at the code, we can see that the function uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the absolute value of `c` and the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase of `c`. 

However, we need to consider potential edge cases. For example, what happens if `c` is not a complex number? The code does not include any error checking to handle this case. 

In Python, the `abs` function can handle non-complex numbers, but the `cmath.phase` function requires a complex number as input. If `c` is not a complex number, the `cmath.phase` function will raise a `TypeError`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return a tuple containing the absolute value and phase of a complex number, but it will raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a complex number.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a complex number `c` and returns a tuple containing its absolute value and phase, but raises a `TypeError` if `c` is not a complex number. **
