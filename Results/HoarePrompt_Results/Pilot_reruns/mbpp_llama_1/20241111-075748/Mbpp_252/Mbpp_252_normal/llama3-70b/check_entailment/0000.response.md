Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` takes a complex number `c` as input and returns a tuple containing its absolute value and phase, which is the expected output for converting complex numbers to polar coordinates.

The code uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the absolute value (or magnitude) of the complex number, and the `cmath.phase` function to calculate its phase (or angle). This is a standard and correct approach for converting complex numbers to polar coordinates.

Now, let's examine the output hints. The hints state that the function raises a `TypeError` if `c` is not a complex number. This is consistent with the code, as the `abs` and `cmath.phase` functions will raise a `TypeError` if their input is not a complex number.

The hints also imply that the function returns a tuple containing the absolute value and phase of the complex number, which is consistent with the code.

Based on the code and the output hints, I believe that the code is correct. The function correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates, and raises a `TypeError` if the input is not a complex number.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly uses the `abs` and `cmath.phase` functions to calculate the absolute value and phase of the complex number, respectively. The function also raises a `TypeError` if the input is not a complex number, as expected. Therefore, the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
