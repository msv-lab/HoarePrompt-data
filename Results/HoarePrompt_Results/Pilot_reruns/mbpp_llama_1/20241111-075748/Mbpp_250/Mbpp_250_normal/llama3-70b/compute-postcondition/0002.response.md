Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I can analyze the functionality of the function as follows:

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elem`. According to the annotations, `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is an element. The function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`.

Upon examining the code, I notice that the function uses the `count` method of the tuple `tup` to return the count of `elem`. This method returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

However, I also consider potential edge cases and missing logic. For instance, what if `elem` is not present in `tup`? In this case, the function will return 0, which is the expected behavior.

Another potential edge case is when `tup` is an empty tuple. In this case, the function will also return 0, which is the expected behavior.

Therefore, based on the code and annotations, I can conclude that the functionality of the function is to return the count of `elem` in `tup`, handling cases where `elem` is not present in `tup` or `tup` is an empty tuple.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the count of `elem` in `tup`, handling cases where `elem` is not present in `tup` or `tup` is an empty tuple. **
