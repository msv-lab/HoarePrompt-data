Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program is correct because it accurately counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The `count()` method in Python returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different inputs. 

After reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function handles tuples of any size and elements of any type, and it correctly returns the count of the specified element. 

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3), 2)`, the function will correctly return `2`, and if we call `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3), 4)`, the function will correctly return `0`. 

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
