Correctness: **True**

The code provided matches the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input and returns the count of `elem` in `tup`. The code uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The annotations provided are also consistent with the code and the problem description. They mention that the function raises a `TypeError` if `tup` is not a tuple or `elem` is not hashable, which is indeed the case. The annotations also mention that the function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`, which is what the code does.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The code handles all possible inputs correctly, including edge cases such as an empty tuple, a tuple with a single element, and a tuple with multiple occurrences of the same element.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing additional information about the expected behavior of the code. They helped me to understand what the code is supposed to do and what types of errors it is supposed to raise. However, I double-checked the annotations against the code to ensure that they are accurate and consistent.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
