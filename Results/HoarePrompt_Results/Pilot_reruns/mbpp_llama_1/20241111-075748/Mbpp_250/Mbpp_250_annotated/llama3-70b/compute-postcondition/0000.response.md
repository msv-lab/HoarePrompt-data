The function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`. The count of `elem` in `tup` is the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple, `elem` is any hashable type, and the function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, `elem` is any hashable type, and the function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`.**
