The function returns the count of `element` in `tup`. The count can be any non-negative integer, depending on how many times `element` appears in `tup`. The return statement does not change the state of `tup` or `element`, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple, `element` is an object that can be compared with elements of `tup` for equality, and the function returns the count of `element` in `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, `element` is an object that can be compared with elements of `tup` for equality, and the function returns the count of `element` in `tup`.**
