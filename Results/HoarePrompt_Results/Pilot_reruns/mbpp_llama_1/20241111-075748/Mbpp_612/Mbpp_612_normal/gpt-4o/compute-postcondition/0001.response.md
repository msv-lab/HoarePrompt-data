The code creates a new list `second_elements` that contains the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since each sublist in `list_of_lists` has exactly two elements, the second element of each sublist can be accessed using the index `1`.

The initial state of `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, but this variable is not affected by the code.

The output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; `second_elements` is a list containing the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; `second_elements` is a list containing the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
