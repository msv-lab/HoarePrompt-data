The given code snippet creates a new list called `first_elements` that contains the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

Since `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements, the first element of each sublist is extracted and added to `first_elements`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
