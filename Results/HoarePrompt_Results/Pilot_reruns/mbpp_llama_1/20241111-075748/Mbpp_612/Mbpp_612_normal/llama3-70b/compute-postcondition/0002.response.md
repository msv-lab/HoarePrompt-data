Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`.
2. The function returns a list of two lists using a list comprehension.
3. The first list contains the first elements of all sublists in `list_of_lists`.
4. The second list contains the second elements of all sublists in `list_of_lists`.

Now, let's examine the code line by line:

* `return [list(element[0] for element in list_of_lists), list(element[1] for element in list_of_lists)]`

This line of code uses list comprehension to create two lists. The first list contains the first elements of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second elements of all sublists in `list_of_lists`.

However, there are some potential edge cases to consider:

* What if `list_of_lists` is empty? In this case, the function will return a list of two empty lists.
* What if a sublist in `list_of_lists` has less than two elements? In this case, the function will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the sublist.
* What if `list_of_lists` is not a list of lists? In this case, the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over the sublists.

Based on the code and the potential edge cases, here is the functionality of the function:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists and returns a list of two lists containing the first and second elements of all sublists respectively, without modifying the original list. However, if a sublist has less than two elements, the function raises an IndexError. If the input is not a list of lists, the function raises a TypeError. If the input list is empty, the function returns a list of two empty lists. **
