The function accepts a list of lists, where each sublist is expected to have exactly two elements. It returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the first elements of each sublist, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist. If a sublist has less than two elements, the function raises an IndexError. If the input is not a list of lists, the function raises a TypeError.
