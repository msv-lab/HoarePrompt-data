Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists. The first list contains the first element of each sublist, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist.

The function uses list comprehension to extract the first and second elements from each sublist and returns them as separate lists. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the problem description.

The provided test cases demonstrate the function's correctness, covering different scenarios such as strings, integers, and nested lists. The function correctly handles these cases and returns the expected output.

After analyzing the code and test cases, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function's logic is straightforward, and the list comprehension approach ensures that it correctly handles the problem description for all possible inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
