Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the code only removes lowercase characters, not substrings. The code uses the `isupper()` method to filter out lowercase characters, but it does not consider the case where a lowercase character is part of a larger substring.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the code will return "HW", but it should return "HWorld" because "ello" is a lowercase substring that should be removed.

The annotations provide some examples of the code's behavior, but they do not cover this specific case. However, they do mention that the function only considers ASCII uppercase characters, which suggests that the code is not designed to handle non-ASCII characters or substrings.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing some context about the code's behavior, but they did not cover the specific case that I identified as incorrect. Overall, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and therefore its correctness is False.
