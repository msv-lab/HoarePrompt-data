Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program removes all lowercase characters from the string, not just lowercase substrings. A substring is a sequence of characters within a string, and the program does not consider the sequence of characters, only individual characters.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW", which is incorrect. The correct output should be "HWorld" because "ello" is a lowercase substring that should be removed.

The program does not handle this case correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
