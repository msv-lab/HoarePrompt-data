Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum of two numbers. It uses a simple conditional expression to return the larger of the two input numbers `a` and `b`. The function works correctly for all potential cases, including positive and negative numbers, as well as equal numbers.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function passes all of them. The function's logic is straightforward and easy to understand, and it does not contain any apparent errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the provided unit tests, I conclude that the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
