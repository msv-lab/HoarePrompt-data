The function returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are not changed, but the function returns the maximum of the two. Since `a` and `b` can be either integers or floats, the returned value can also be either an integer or a float.

Output State: **`a` is a number, `b` is a number, and the function returns the maximum of `a` and `b`.**
