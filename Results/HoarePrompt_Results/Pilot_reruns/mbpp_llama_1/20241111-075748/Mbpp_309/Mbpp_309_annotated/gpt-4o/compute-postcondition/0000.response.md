The function returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are numbers that can be compared, the function will return either `a` or `b` depending on which one is greater. The return statement does not change the state of `a` and `b`, so they remain numbers that can be compared.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are numbers that can be compared, and the function returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`.**
