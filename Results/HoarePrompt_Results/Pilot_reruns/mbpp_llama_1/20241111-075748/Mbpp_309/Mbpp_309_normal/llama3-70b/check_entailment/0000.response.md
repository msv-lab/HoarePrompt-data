Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `max` function to return the maximum of two numbers, which aligns with the problem description.

However, I can think of some edge cases that the code might not be handling. For example, what if the inputs are not numbers? The problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, but the code will raise a TypeError.

Upon examining the output hints, I see that they agree with the code. The hints state that the function raises a TypeError if the inputs are not numbers, which is consistent with the code's behavior.

The output hints also mention that if the inputs are equal, the function returns one of the equal values. This is also consistent with the code's behavior, as the `max` function will return one of the equal values in this case.

After considering the code, the problem description, and the output hints, I believe that the code is correct. It handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints, and it behaves as expected in all cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code uses the built-in `max` function to return the maximum of two numbers, which is a straightforward and correct implementation of the problem description. The code also handles edge cases such as non-numeric inputs and equal inputs correctly, as described in the output hints.
