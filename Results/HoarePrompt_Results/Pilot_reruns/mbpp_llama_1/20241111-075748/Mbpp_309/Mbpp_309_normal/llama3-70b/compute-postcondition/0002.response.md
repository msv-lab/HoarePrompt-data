Let's break down the code and annotations step by step:

* The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`.
* The function returns the maximum of `a` and `b` using the built-in `max` function.
* The annotations state that `a` and `b` are numbers, and the function returns the maximum of `a` and `b`.

From the code, we can see that the function does indeed return the maximum of `a` and `b`. However, we should consider potential edge cases:

* What if `a` and `b` are not numbers? The `max` function will raise a TypeError if the inputs are not comparable.
* What if `a` and `b` are equal? The `max` function will return one of the equal values.

Considering these edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum of `a` and `b` if they are comparable numbers. If `a` and `b` are not numbers, the function raises a TypeError. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns one of the equal values. **
