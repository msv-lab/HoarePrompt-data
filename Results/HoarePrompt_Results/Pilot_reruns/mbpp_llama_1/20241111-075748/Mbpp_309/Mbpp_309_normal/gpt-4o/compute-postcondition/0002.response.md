Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`.
2. The function returns `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`.
3. The annotations state that the function returns the greater value between `a` and `b`, which is consistent with the code.

However, we should consider potential edge cases:

* What if `a` and `b` are equal? In this case, the function will return `a`, but it's worth noting that the function could also return `b` in this case, as both values are equal.
* What if `a` or `b` are not numbers? The code does not handle this case explicitly, but in Python, comparing non-numeric values using `>` will raise a TypeError.

Considering these edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the greater value between them. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns `a`. If `a` or `b` are not numbers, the function raises a TypeError. **
