To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

Initial State: `nested_list` is a list with at least three elements, `flat_list` is a list.

The code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.append(item)
```
However, there is no information about the variable `item`. Assuming `item` is a variable that has been previously defined or is in the scope of the current execution context, let's proceed with the analysis.

The `append` method adds an element to the end of the list. In this case, it adds the value of `item` to the end of `flat_list`.

Since we don't know the value of `item`, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can conclude that the length of `flat_list` will increase by 1.

The state of `nested_list` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least three elements, `flat_list` has an additional element (`item`) appended to it**
