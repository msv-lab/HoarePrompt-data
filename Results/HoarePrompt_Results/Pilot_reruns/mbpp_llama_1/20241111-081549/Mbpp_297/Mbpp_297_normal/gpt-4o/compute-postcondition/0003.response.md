To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `nested_list` is a list with at least one element.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- `item` is the first element in the `nested_list`.

The code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.append(item)
```
Now, let's think step by step:

1. The `append` method is called on `flat_list`.
2. The argument passed to the `append` method is `item`, which is the first element in the `nested_list`.
3. The `append` method adds its argument to the end of the list it is called on.
4. Since `flat_list` is initially empty, `item` becomes its first element.

Considering the previous values of the affected variables and the result of the code execution, the output state is:
- `nested_list` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code snippet.
- `flat_list` is no longer empty; it now contains the first element of `nested_list`, which is `item`.
- `item` remains the first element in the `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least one element, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`, `item` is the first element in the `nested_list`.**
