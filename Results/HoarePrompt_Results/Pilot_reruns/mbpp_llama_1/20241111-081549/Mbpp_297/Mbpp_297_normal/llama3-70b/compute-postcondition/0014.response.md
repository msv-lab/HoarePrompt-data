Based on the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations, I can determine the loop's output state as follows:

The loop's functionality is to flatten a nested list into a single list. It iterates over each element in the `nested_list`. If the element is a list itself, it calls the `func_1` function to flatten the sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to the `flat_list`.

After the loop executes, the `flat_list` will contain all the elements from the `nested_list`, with any sublists flattened into single elements. The `nested_list` will remain unchanged.

If the `nested_list` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the `flat_list` will remain empty.

If the `nested_list` contains only non-list elements, the loop will iterate over each element and append it to the `flat_list`.

If the `nested_list` contains only list elements, the loop will iterate over each sublist, call `func_1` to flatten the sublist, and extend the `flat_list` with the result.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`flat_list` is the flattened version of `nested_list`, with all sublists recursively flattened using `func_1`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains empty. `nested_list` remains unchanged.**
