The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain other lists as elements, with all non-list elements being of the same type, and returns its flattened version. However, it does not enforce the constraint of same-type non-list elements and may produce unexpected behavior if this constraint is not met. Additionally, it does not handle non-list arguments and will raise a `TypeError` if such an argument is passed.
