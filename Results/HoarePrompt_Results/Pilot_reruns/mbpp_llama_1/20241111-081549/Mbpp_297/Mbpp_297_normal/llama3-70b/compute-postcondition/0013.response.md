To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the for loop statement and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop iterates over the elements of `nested_list`. For the loop to execute again, `nested_list` must have at least one more element to process.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements.
* The first element of `nested_list` is processed and removed from `nested_list` and added to `flat_list`.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `nested_list` to have at least one more element to process. Since the first element was removed, the new first element of `nested_list` will be the second element from the previous iteration.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` has at least one more element than before**
