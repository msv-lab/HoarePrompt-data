Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I have analyzed the function `func_1` as follows:

The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a list that may contain other lists as elements, with all non-list elements being of the same type.

Upon examining the code, I noticed that the function recursively flattens the `nested_list` by iterating over its elements. If an element is a list, the function calls itself with that element as an argument, effectively flattening the sublist. If an element is not a list, it is appended to the `flat_list`.

The code seems to handle the case where `nested_list` is empty, as the `flat_list` will remain empty in this scenario.

However, I did not find any explicit handling for the case where `nested_list` contains elements of different types (other than lists). The annotations mention that all non-list elements are of the same type, but the code does not enforce this constraint. Therefore, if `nested_list` contains elements of different types, the function will still attempt to flatten it, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `nested_list` is not a list at all. If a non-list argument is passed to the function, it will raise a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over it.

Considering these observations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain other lists as elements, with all non-list elements being of the same type, and returns its flattened version. However, it does not enforce the constraint of same-type non-list elements and may produce unexpected behavior if this constraint is not met. Additionally, it does not handle non-list arguments and will raise a `TypeError` if such an argument is passed. **
