To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the state of `nested_list`. The loop will iterate over each element in `nested_list`. For the loop to start executing, `nested_list` must have at least one element. Additionally, since `element` is the variable used in the loop, its state needs to be defined at the start of the loop.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`**
