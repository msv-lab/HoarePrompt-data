The code `flat_list.append(item)` adds an `item` to the end of the `flat_list`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `item`. Since `nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists with at least one element, it is possible that `item` is an element from `nested_list`.

Assuming `item` is an element from `nested_list`, the output state would be that `flat_list` has one more element than before, and the element is an item from `nested_list`. The state of `nested_list` is not affected.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists with at least one element, `flat_list` has one more element than before, and the new element is an item from `nested_list`.**
