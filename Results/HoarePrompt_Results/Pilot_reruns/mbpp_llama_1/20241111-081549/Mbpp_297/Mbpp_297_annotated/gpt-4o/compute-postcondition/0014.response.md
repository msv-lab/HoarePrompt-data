Based on the loop code and the initial state, I will determine the loop's output state.

The loop's functionality is to flatten a nested list, where each nested list may also contain nested lists, and so on. The loop iterates over each item in the `nested_list`. If the item is a list, it calls the `func_1` function to flatten that list and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to the `flat_list`.

Output State: **`flat_list` contains the flattened version of `nested_list`, where all nested lists have been recursively flattened and their elements have been appended to `flat_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains an empty list. If `nested_list` contains only non-list elements, `flat_list` contains all those elements. If `nested_list` contains a mix of list and non-list elements, `flat_list` contains the flattened list of all elements.**

Note that the output state includes the cases where the loop does not execute, i.e., when `nested_list` is empty, and the values of the variables in those cases, i.e., `flat_list` remains an empty list.
