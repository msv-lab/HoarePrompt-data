To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- `item` is the first element in `nested_list`.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
flat_list.append(item)
```

Impact of the Code on the Program:
- The `append` method is used to add an element to the end of the `flat_list`.
- The element being added is `item`, which is the first element of `nested_list`.

Since `item` can be either a simple element (like an integer or a string) or a nested list (because `nested_list` may contain nested lists), we need to consider both possibilities:

1. If `item` is a simple element, it will be directly appended to `flat_list`.
2. If `item` is a nested list, the entire nested list will be appended to `flat_list` as a single element.

Output State:
- `nested_list` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
- `flat_list` is no longer empty; it now contains the first element of `nested_list` as its first element.
- `item` remains the same, as the code does not modify it.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list` as its first element, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`.**
