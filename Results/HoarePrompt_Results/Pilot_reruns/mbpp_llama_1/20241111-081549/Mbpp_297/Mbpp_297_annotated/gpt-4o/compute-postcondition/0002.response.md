To solve this task, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program and calculate the result based on the initial state.

The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` extends the `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. 

Since `item` is the first element in `nested_list`, `func_1(item)` will be executed with this element. However, the specific result of `func_1(item)` is unknown, as the function `func_1` is not defined in the given code.

Assuming `func_1(item)` returns a list of elements, the `flat_list` will be extended with these elements.

The state of `nested_list` is not affected, as it is not modified in the given code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists, `flat_list` contains the result of `func_1(item)` added to its initial empty state, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists, `flat_list` contains the result of `func_1(item)`, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`.**
