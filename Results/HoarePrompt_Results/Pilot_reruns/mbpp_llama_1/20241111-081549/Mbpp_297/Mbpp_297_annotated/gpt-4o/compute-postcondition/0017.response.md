Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing nested lists, and returns a flattened version of the list.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It initializes an empty list `flat_list`.
2. It iterates over each item in the `nested_list`.
3. If the item is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that item and extends the `flat_list` with the result.
4. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the `flat_list`.
5. Finally, it returns the `flat_list`.

The annotations suggest that the function returns the flattened version of the `nested_list`. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the function handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and returns a list containing all non-list elements from the original list.

The code correctly handles the following edge cases:

* An empty `nested_list` returns an empty `flat_list`.
* A `nested_list` containing only non-list elements returns a list containing all those elements.
* A `nested_list` containing a mix of list and non-list elements returns a list containing the flattened version of all elements.

However, the annotations do not explicitly mention what happens when the `nested_list` contains non-list elements of different types. The code does not perform any type checking, so it will simply append all non-list elements to the `flat_list`, regardless of their type.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a nested list and returns a flattened list containing all non-list elements from the original list, handling nested lists of arbitrary depth and non-list elements of any type. **
