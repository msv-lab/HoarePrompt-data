According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists, and the first element has been processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least one more element, which means it should have at least one element remaining after removing the first element.

State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists with at least one element, `flat_list` is a list.**
