According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists, and all sublists can also contain integers and/or lists, and so on, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, the `nested_list` must have at least one element, and `element` should be the first element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`**
