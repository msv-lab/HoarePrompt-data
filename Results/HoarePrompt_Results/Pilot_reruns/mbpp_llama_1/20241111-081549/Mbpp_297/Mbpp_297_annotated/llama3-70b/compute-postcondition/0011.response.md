The code `flat_list.append(element)` appends the `element` to the `flat_list`. The `element` is the third element in the `nested_list`. 

The state of `nested_list` is not changed, it is still a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least three elements. 

The state of `flat_list` is changed, it now contains one more element which is the third element of the `nested_list`.

The state of `element` is not changed, it is still the third element in the `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least three elements, `flat_list` contains the third element of `nested_list`, `element` is the third element in the `nested_list`.**
