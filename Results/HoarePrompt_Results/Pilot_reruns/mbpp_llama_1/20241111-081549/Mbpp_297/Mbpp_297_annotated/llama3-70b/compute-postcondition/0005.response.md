To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least one element.
- `flat_list` is a list.
- `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`.

Loop statement:
```python
for element in nested_list:
    # the loop body is omit
```

According to the loop statement, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list` having more elements. At the end of the last iteration, `element` is the first element in the `nested_list`, which means for the loop to execute again, `element` should be the next element in the `nested_list`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `element` should be the next element in the `nested_list`.
- Since `nested_list` has at least one element and we have processed the first element, `nested_list` should have at least two elements for the loop to execute again.

The state of `flat_list` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least two elements, `flat_list` is a list, and `element` is the second element in the `nested_list`.**
