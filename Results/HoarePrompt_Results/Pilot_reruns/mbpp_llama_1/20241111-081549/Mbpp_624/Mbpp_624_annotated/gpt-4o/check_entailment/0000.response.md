Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns its uppercase version using the `upper()` method. The problem description requires a function to convert a given string to uppercase, which is exactly what the code does.

The annotations provided are consistent with the code and the problem description. They mention that the function returns the uppercase version of `s` if `s` is a string, raises an AttributeError if `s` is not a string, and handles empty strings and strings containing only whitespace characters correctly. These claims are all valid and match the behavior of the `upper()` method.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code handles all possible input cases, including strings with letters, digits, special characters, empty strings, and strings with only whitespace characters. The `upper()` method is a built-in Python method that correctly converts all characters in a string to uppercase, so the code should work correctly for all possible inputs.

Overall, the code matches the problem description and the annotations, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.
