Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and returns `s.upper()`. The annotation states that `s` is a string, and the function returns the uppercase version of `s`.

However, the code does not explicitly check if `s` is a string. If `s` is not a string, the `upper()` method will raise an AttributeError. Therefore, the functionality of the function should include this potential edge case.

Additionally, the annotation does not mention what happens if `s` is an empty string or a string containing only whitespace characters. The code will still return an uppercase version of the string in these cases.

Considering all potential cases, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter `s` and returns its uppercase version if `s` is a string. If `s` is not a string, the function raises an AttributeError. The function also handles empty strings and strings containing only whitespace characters, returning their uppercase versions. **
