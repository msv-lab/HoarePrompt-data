Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns its uppercase version using the `upper()` method.

However, I can think of an edge case where the code might not be handling correctly. What if the input `s` is not a string? The problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, but the code might raise an `AttributeError` because the `upper()` method is not defined for non-string types.

Now, let's look at the output hints. They agree with the code and mention that the function may raise an `AttributeError` if `s` is not a string. This confirms my initial suspicion that the code might not be handling non-string inputs correctly.

Since the problem description does not specify what should happen when the input is not a string, I would argue that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, I conclude that the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle non-string inputs correctly, and the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case. For example, if the input is an integer, the code will raise an `AttributeError` instead of returning an error message or a default value.
