Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1(tup)` is supposed to return the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple. However, the function only returns the index of the first tuple element it encounters, not the count of elements before it.

A counterexample is when the tuple has multiple tuple elements. For instance, if we call `func_1((1, 2, (3, 4), 5, (6, 7)))`, the function will return 2, which is the index of the first tuple element `(3, 4)`. However, the correct answer should be the total count of elements before the first tuple element, which is 2.

Another issue is that the function returns the length of the tuple if no tuple element is found, which is not correct according to the problem description. If no tuple element is found, the function should return 0, not the length of the tuple.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
