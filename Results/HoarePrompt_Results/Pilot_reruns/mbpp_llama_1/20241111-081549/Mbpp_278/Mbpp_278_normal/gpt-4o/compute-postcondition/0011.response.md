Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least three elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`, and `count` is 3. If `elem` is a tuple, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to `tup`, `elem`, or `count`.***
