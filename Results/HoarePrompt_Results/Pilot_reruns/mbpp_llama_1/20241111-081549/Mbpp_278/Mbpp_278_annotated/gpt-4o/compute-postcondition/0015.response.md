Output State: **`count` is returned, where `count` is either 0 (if `tup` is empty or contains only tuple elements) or the number of non-tuple elements before the first tuple element in `tup` (if `tup` contains at least one non-tuple element followed by a tuple element) or the total number of elements in `tup` (if `tup` contains only non-tuple elements), and the state of other variables remains unchanged**
