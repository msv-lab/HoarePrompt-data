Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple that contains at least three tuple elements, `count` is 3, and `elem` is the third element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without breaking, with the state of `tup`, `count`, and `elem` remaining unchanged.***
