Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as input.
2. The function iterates over each element `elem` in the tuple `tup`.
3. If an element `elem` is a tuple itself, the function returns the index of that element in the tuple `tup`.
4. If no tuple elements are found in the tuple `tup`, the function returns the length of the tuple `tup`.

Now, let's examine the potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If the input tuple `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the length of the tuple, which is 0. This is consistent with the annotations.
* If the input tuple `tup` contains at least one element, but no tuple elements are found, the function returns the length of the tuple. This is consistent with the annotations.
* If the input tuple `tup` contains a tuple element, the function returns the index of that element. This is consistent with the annotations.
* However, the annotations do not mention what happens if the input tuple `tup` contains multiple tuple elements. In this case, the function will return the index of the first tuple element found, not the last one or all of them.

Considering all potential cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` as input, returns the index of the first tuple element found, or the length of the tuple if no tuple elements are found. If the input tuple is empty, it returns 0. **
