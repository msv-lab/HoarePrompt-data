Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, if there are multiple tuple elements in the input tuple, the function will return the index of the first tuple element it encounters, not the number of elements that occur before the tuple element.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, (3, 4), 5, (6, 7))`, the function will return `2`, which is the index of the first tuple element `(3, 4)`. However, the problem description asks for the number of elements that occur before the tuple element, which in this case would be `2` for the first tuple element and `4` for the second tuple element.

The function is also not handling the case where the tuple element is not found in the input tuple. In this case, the function will return the length of the tuple, which is not the correct result.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to count the number of elements before the first tuple element, and handle the case where the tuple element is not found.
