Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the difference between two lists. It uses the symmetric difference of sets to find the elements that are in either list but not both, and then sorts the result based on the order of appearance in the combined list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

* If an element is present in both lists, it is not included in the result.
* If an element is present in only one list, it is included in the result.
* The order of elements in the result is based on their first appearance in the combined list, which is consistent with the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various inputs.

Overall, the function is well-written and correctly implements the desired behavior, making it correct for all potential cases.
