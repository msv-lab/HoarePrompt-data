Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the difference between two lists. It uses the symmetric difference operator (`^`) to find elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both. The `set` function is used to convert the lists to sets, which automatically removes duplicates. The `sorted` function is then used to sort the resulting list.

The function works correctly for all potential cases:

* If the lists are identical, the function returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
* If the lists have some common elements, the function returns a list of elements that are unique to each list.
* If the lists have no common elements, the function returns a list of all elements from both lists.
* If one or both of the lists are empty, the function returns the non-empty list or an empty list, respectively.

The use of the `set` function ensures that the function works correctly even if the input lists contain duplicate elements. The `sorted` function ensures that the output list is in a consistent order.

Overall, the function is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
