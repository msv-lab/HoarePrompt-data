The function func_1 accepts two lists, list1 and list2, as parameters. It creates sets from these lists, calculates the symmetric difference between the sets (i.e., elements that are in list1 or list2 but not in both), and converts the result back into a list. The list is then sorted based on the index of each element in the combined list of list1 and list2. However, if an element appears in both list1 and list2, but at different indices, the sorting will be based on the index of the element in the combined list, which may not accurately reflect the original order in either list1 or list2. Additionally, if there are duplicate elements in either list1 or list2, they will be treated as a single element in the set and the resulting list, since sets only store unique elements.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in list1 or list2 but not in both, ordered by their index in the combined list of list1 and list2, with potential inconsistencies in sorting for elements that appear in both lists at different indices, and ignoring duplicate elements within each list. **
