To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code `diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)` calculates the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference of two sets is a set of elements that are in exactly one of the sets.

Given that `set1` is a set created from `list1` and `set2` is a set created from `list2`, the symmetric difference will contain elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both.

The output state will be the same for `list1` and `list2` as they are not modified in the code. `set1` and `set2` are also not modified directly, but their symmetric difference is calculated and stored in `diff_elements`.

Therefore, the output state is: `list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, and `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, and `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both**
