The function returns `result_list`. The state of the variables does not change, but the function returns the value of `result_list`, which is a sorted list containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, sorted by their index in `list1 + list2`. Therefore, the output state is: `list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, `result_list` is a sorted list containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, sorted by their index in `list1 + list2`, and the function returns `result_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, `result_list` is a sorted list containing elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both, sorted by their index in `list1 + list2`, and the function returns `result_list`.**
