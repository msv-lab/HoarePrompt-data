Let's break down the information:

* The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`.
* Both `list1` and `list2` are lists.
* The function returns a sorted list of elements that are in exactly one of the lists `list1` or `list2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of elements that are in exactly one of the lists.**
