To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze the provided code and annotations step by step.

1. **Function Signature and Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `input_string`.

2. **Functionality According to Annotations**: The annotations indicate that the function replaces all spaces in `input_string` with '%20' and returns the new string.

3. **Actual Code Analysis**: The code line `return input_string.replace(' ', '%20')` indeed replaces all spaces in `input_string` with '%20' and returns the resulting string. This matches the functionality described in the annotations.

4. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - **Handling Non-String Inputs**: The annotations and code do not specify how the function handles inputs that are not strings. In Python, attempting to call the `replace` method on a non-string object would result in an AttributeError. Therefore, it's implied that the function expects a string input, but it does not include error handling for non-string inputs.
   - **Null or Empty Strings**: The function would handle null or empty strings by returning them as is, since there would be no spaces to replace.
   - **Strings with No Spaces**: For strings without spaces, the function would return the original string, as there would be no replacements to make.

5. **Functionality Summary**: Considering the code and potential edge cases, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input, replaces all spaces with '%20', and returns the new string. It implicitly expects a string input and does not handle non-string inputs, returning null or empty strings unchanged, and strings without spaces as they are. **
