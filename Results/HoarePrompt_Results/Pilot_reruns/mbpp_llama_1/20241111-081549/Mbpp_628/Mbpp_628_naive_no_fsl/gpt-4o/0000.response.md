Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input string and replaces all spaces with '%20' using the built-in `replace` method. This is a straightforward and efficient solution.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function for different input strings. I have reviewed the code and couldn't find any potential edge cases or missing logic that would cause the function to fail.

The `replace` method is a standard Python method that replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring, and it is well-documented to work correctly for all types of input strings. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and will work as expected for all potential input cases.
