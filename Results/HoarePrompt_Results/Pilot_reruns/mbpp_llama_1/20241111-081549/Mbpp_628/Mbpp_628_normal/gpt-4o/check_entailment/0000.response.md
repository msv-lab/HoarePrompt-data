Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces in the input string with '%20', which matches the problem description.

After examining the output hints, I agree that they accurately describe the behavior of the code. The hints state that the function replaces all spaces (including multiple consecutive spaces) with '%20', which is consistent with the code's use of the `replace` method.

Upon further review, I can think of no edge cases that the code might not be handling. The `replace` method is designed to replace all occurrences of a substring, regardless of whether they are consecutive or not. Therefore, I believe that the code will correctly replace all spaces with '%20' in all possible input strings.

The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate that the function works correctly for a variety of input strings.

Correctness: **True**
