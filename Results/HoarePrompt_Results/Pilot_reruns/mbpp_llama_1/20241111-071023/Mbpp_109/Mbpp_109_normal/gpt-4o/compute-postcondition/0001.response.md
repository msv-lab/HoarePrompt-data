According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `binary_str` is a string consisting of binary digits, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, and `count` is 0. However, `num_rotations` being non-negative does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state.

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of binary digits, `num_rotations` is at least 1, `count` is 0**
