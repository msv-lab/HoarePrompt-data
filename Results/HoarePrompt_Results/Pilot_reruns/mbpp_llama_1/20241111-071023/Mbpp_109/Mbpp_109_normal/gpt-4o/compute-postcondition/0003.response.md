`integer_value` is assigned the value of `binary_str` converted to an integer with base 2. The value of `binary_str` is not specified, but it is rotated one position to the right, so its exact value is unknown. The conversion to an integer will depend on the specific value of `binary_str`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`binary_str` is rotated one position to the right, `num_rotations` is at least 1, `count` is 0, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str`**
