The function rotates a binary string `num_rotations` positions to the right, counts the number of times the resulting integer value is odd during the rotations, and returns the count, assuming the input string is a valid binary string and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. If `num_rotations` is greater than the length of `binary_str`, the rotation is equivalent to rotating by `num_rotations % len(binary_str)` positions.
