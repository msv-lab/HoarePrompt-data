Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is rotated two positions to the right, `num_rotations` is at least 2, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, ensuring it is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the new `integer_value` is even or odd.***
