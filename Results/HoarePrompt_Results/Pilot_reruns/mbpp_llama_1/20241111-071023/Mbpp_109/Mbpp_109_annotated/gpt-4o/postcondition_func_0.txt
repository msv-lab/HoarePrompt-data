The function accepts a binary string and a non-negative integer, rotates the binary string to the right by the specified number of positions, and returns the count of rotated strings with an odd integer value. If the input string is not a valid binary string (i.e., it contains characters other than '0' and '1'), the function may produce incorrect results. Additionally, if the input string is empty, the function will return 0.
