Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`.
2. The code initializes a variable `count` to 0.
3. The code then enters a loop that runs `num_rotations` times.
4. Inside the loop, the code rotates the `binary_str` to the right by one position using slicing.
5. The code then converts the rotated `binary_str` to an integer using the `int` function with base 2.
6. If the integer value is odd, the code increments the `count` variable.
7. After the loop finishes, the code returns the `count` variable.

Now, let's examine the annotations and return postconditions:

* The annotations state that `binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer.
* The return postconditions state that `binary_str` is rotated to the right by `num_rotations` positions, `count` is the number of times the rotated `binary_str` has an odd integer value, and the function returns `count`.

Based on the code and annotations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a binary string and a non-negative integer, rotates the binary string to the right by the specified number of positions, and returns the count of rotated strings with an odd integer value. If the input string is not a valid binary string (i.e., it contains characters other than '0' and '1'), the function may produce incorrect results. Additionally, if the input string is empty, the function will return 0. **

Note that the annotations do not explicitly mention what happens if the input string is not a valid binary string or if it is empty. However, based on the code, we can infer that the function may produce incorrect results in these cases. Therefore, we include these potential edge cases in the functionality summary.
