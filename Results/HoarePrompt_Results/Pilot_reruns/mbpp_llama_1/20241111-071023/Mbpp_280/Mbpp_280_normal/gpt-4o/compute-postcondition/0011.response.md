The function returns `False` and `-1`, regardless of the previous state. The state of `arr` and `element` remains unchanged. The function's return value is now defined, whereas it was previously undefined when `element` was not found in `arr` or when `arr` was an empty list.

Output State: **The function returns `False` and `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, and `element` remains unchanged.**
