To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that allow it to run. The loop uses `enumerate(arr)`, which means it will iterate over both the index and the value of each element in the array `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element.

Given the initial state where `arr` is a list and `elem` is any type of object that can be compared to elements of `arr` for equality, we need to adjust the state so that `arr` has at least one element. The variable `elem` does not directly affect the loop's execution since it's not used in the loop's initialization or condition.

At the start of the loop, `i` (the index) should be 0, and `x` should be the first element of `arr`. 

State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `arr`**
