Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input, iterates through the array using the `enumerate` function, and checks if the current value matches the given element. If a match is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index position of the element. If the element is not found after iterating through the entire array, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If the element is present in the array, the function returns the correct index position.
* If the element is not present in the array, the function returns `-1` as the index position.
* The function handles arrays of different lengths and with different types of elements (e.g., integers, as shown in the provided assertions).

The assertions provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program for specific test cases. After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I could not find any scenario where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
