The function returns `True` and `i`, and `i` has a value of 1. The state of the variables does not change, so the output state is `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 1**
