According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list and `elem` is any type of object, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. 

For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least 1 element, and the index `i` should be initialized to 0, and `x` should be the first element in the list `arr`. The state of `elem` is not relevant to the execution of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list `arr`**
