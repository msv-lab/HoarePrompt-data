Correctness: **True**.

I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python function `func_1` and tested it with various inputs. The function correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. 

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The function first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(ch)`. If the character is not found, it returns -1.

2. Then, it finds the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(ch)`. If the character is not found, it also returns -1.

3. If the character is not found at all, or if it appears only once in the string (i.e., `first_index == last_index`), the function simply returns the original string.

4. If the character appears more than once, the function returns a new string that excludes the first and last occurrence of the character. This is achieved by concatenating three substrings: `s[:first_index]`, `s[first_index + 1:last_index]`, and `s[last_index + 1:]`.

I have tested the function with various inputs, including the ones provided in the assertions, and it works correctly in all cases. I couldn't find any potential case where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
