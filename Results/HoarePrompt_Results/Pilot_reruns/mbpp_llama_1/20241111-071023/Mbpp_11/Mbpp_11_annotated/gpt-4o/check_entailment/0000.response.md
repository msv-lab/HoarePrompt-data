Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the code removes all occurrences of the character except the first and last ones.

The annotations suggest that the function returns the original string if the character occurs not more than once, or a modified string with all occurrences of the character except the first and last ones removed if the character occurs more than once. However, this behavior does not match the problem description.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly is when the input string is "abca" and the character to be removed is "a". The expected output should be "bc", but the program will return "bca", which is incorrect.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by highlighting the cases where the function returns the original string or a modified string. However, upon closer examination, I realized that the annotations were describing a different behavior than what the problem description specified.
