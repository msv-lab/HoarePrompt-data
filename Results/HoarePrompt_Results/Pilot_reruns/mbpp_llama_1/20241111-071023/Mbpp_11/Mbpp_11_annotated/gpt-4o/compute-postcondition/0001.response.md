`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, and `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`. `last_index` is assigned the value of the last index of `ch` in `s`. The state of `s`, `ch`, and `first_index` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
