The code `first_index = s.find(ch)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` to the variable `first_index`. Since `ch` is a character that appears at least once in `s`, the `find` method will return a non-negative integer index.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, and `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
