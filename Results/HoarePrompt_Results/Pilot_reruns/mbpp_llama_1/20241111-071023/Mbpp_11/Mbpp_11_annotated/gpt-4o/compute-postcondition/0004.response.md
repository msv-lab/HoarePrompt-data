The function returns a modified version of `s`. If `ch` occurs only once in `s`, `s[first_index + 1:last_index]` will be an empty string, and `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]` will be equivalent to `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:]`, effectively removing the first occurrence of `ch` from `s`. If `ch` occurs more than once in `s`, `s[first_index + 1:last_index]` will include all occurrences of `ch` except the first and last ones, and `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]` will remove all occurrences of `ch` except the first and last ones. If `ch` does not occur in `s`, the function returns `s` as is. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a modified string where all occurrences of `ch` except possibly the first and last ones are removed, and the function returns this modified string.

Output State: **`s` is a modified string where all occurrences of `ch` except possibly the first and last ones are removed, and the function returns this modified string**
