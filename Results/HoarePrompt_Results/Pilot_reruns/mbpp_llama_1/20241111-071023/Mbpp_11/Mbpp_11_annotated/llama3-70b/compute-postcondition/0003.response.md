The function returns `s`, and `s` is a string. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, and the function returns the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, and the function returns the string `s`.**
