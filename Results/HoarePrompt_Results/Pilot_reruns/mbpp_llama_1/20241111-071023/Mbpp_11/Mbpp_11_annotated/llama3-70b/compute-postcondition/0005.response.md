The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `c`. `s` is a string and `c` is a character. After executing the function body, if `c` is found in `s`, the function returns a string that is `s` with all occurrences of `c` removed. If `c` is not found in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, and return the string `s` with all occurrences of `c` removed if `c` is found in `s`, otherwise return the original string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, returns the string `s` with all occurrences of `c` removed if `c` is found in `s`, otherwise returns the original string `s`.**
