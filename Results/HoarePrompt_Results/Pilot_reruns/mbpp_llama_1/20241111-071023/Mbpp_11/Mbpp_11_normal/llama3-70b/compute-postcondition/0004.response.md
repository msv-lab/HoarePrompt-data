Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a character. If `c` is found in `s` at both the first and last occurrences, the function returns the modified string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed. Otherwise, if `c` is not found in `s` or found only at one occurrence, the function returns the original string `s`.***
