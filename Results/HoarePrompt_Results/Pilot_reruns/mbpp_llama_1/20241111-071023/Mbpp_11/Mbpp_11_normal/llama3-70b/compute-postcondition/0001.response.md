`last_occ` is assigned the value of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found. The value of `s`, `c`, and `first_occ` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found.**
