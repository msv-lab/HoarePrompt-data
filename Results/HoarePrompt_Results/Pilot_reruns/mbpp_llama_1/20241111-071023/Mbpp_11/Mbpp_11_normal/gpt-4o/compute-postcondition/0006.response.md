The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`. According to the code, it finds the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once, the function returns `s` unchanged. However, if `ch` occurs more than once, the function returns a modified string where the first and last occurrences of `ch` are removed.

Upon closer inspection, the code actually removes the characters at the indices `first_index` and `last_index`, but also removes all characters between `first_index + 1` and `last_index`. This is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations, but it is what the code actually does.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a string `s` and a single character `ch`, and return the original string if `ch` occurs only once or not at all. If `ch` occurs more than once, the function returns a modified string with all characters between the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, including the characters at the indices `first_index` and `last_index`.
