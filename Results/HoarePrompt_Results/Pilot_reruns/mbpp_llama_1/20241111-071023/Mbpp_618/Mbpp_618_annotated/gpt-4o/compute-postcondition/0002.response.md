Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. According to the annotations, these lists should be of the same length, contain only numbers, and `list2` should not contain any zeros.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the corresponding elements of `list1` and `list2` using the `zip` function. For each pair of elements, it calculates the division of the element from `list1` by the element from `list2` and returns a list of these division results.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the code does not check if the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal. If they are not, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter list, and the remaining elements in the longer list will be ignored. This is a potential edge case that is not covered by the annotations.

Additionally, the code does not check if the elements of `list2` are non-zero. If a zero is encountered, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be raised.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a list of floats, where each float is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. However, if the lists are of unequal length, the function will ignore the remaining elements in the longer list. If a zero is encountered in `list2`, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a list of floats, where each float is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. If the lists are of unequal length, the function ignores the remaining elements in the longer list. If a zero is encountered in `list2`, the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. **
