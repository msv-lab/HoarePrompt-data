The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. Since `list1` and `list2` are of the same length and `list2` does not contain any zeros, the division operation will not raise any exceptions.

The function returns a new list where each element is the result of the division operation.

Output State: **The function returns a list of numbers where each number is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
