Let's analyze the given information step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length, containing only numbers. Additionally, `list2` does not contain any zero.

The function returns a list of numbers, where each number is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of the same length, where `list2` does not contain any zero, and return a new list containing the result of dividing corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, list1 and list2, of the same length, where list2 does not contain any zero, and returns a new list containing the result of dividing corresponding elements from list1 and list2.**
