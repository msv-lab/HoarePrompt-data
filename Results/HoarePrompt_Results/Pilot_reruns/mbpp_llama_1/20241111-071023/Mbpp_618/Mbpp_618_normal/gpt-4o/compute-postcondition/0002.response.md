Let's analyze the code and annotations step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as parameters. The annotations state that these lists should be of the same length, containing numbers, with `list2` having no zeros.

However, upon examining the code, we notice that there is no explicit check for these conditions. The code simply uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of `list1` and `list2` and performs division operations.

If `list1` and `list2` are not of the same length, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter list, effectively ignoring the remaining elements of the longer list. This is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.

Moreover, if `list2` contains zeros, the division operation will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Again, this is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, we can conclude that the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list with the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2` divided, stopping at the end of the shorter list if they are not of the same length, and raising a `ZeroDivisionError` if `list2` contains zeros. **
