Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the two input lists are of different lengths. If the lists are of different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter list, and the remaining elements in the longer list will be ignored. This may lead to incorrect results.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`, the function will return `[0.25, 0.4]`, ignoring the third element `3` in the first list.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the second list contains zeros. If the second list contains a zero, the division operation will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 0, 6])`, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to divide `2` by `0`.

To fix these issues, the program should add error checking to handle these cases, for example by checking the lengths of the input lists and handling zeros in the second list.
