The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `list_of_lists` as a parameter. According to the annotations, it iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists` and keeps track of the maximum length of all sublists in the variable `max_length`. 

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it is clear that the code does exactly what the annotations say. 

The function returns the maximum length of all sublists in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns 0, since the loop does not execute and `max_length` remains 0.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists, returns the maximum length of all sublists, or 0 if the list of lists is empty. **
