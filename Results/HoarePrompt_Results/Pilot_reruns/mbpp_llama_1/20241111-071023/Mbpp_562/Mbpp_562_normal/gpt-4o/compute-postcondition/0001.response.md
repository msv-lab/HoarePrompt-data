According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `max_length` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `list_of_lists` is not empty and `sublist` is the first sublist in the list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is 0, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list**
