To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more sublist in `list_of_lists` after the current `sublist`.

Current state:
* `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist
* `max_length` is either 0 or the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists` if it is greater than the initial `max_length` of 0
* `sublist` remains the first sublist in `list_of_lists`

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state as follows:

* `list_of_lists` should have at least 2 sublists, since we've already processed the first one.
* `sublist` should be the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, since we're moving to the next iteration.
* `max_length` might need to be updated if the length of the second sublist is greater than the current `max_length`.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is either 0 or the length of the first or second sublist in `list_of_lists` if it is greater than the initial `max_length` of 0, and `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
