To solve this task, let's think step by step about the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code `max_length = len(sublist)` assigns the length of the `sublist` to the variable `max_length`. 

Initially, `max_length` is 0, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, and `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

After execution, `max_length` will be the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. The state of `list_of_lists` is not affected, and `sublist` remains the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_length` is the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_length` is the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
