To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that make the loop body run at least once. Given the for loop statement, it iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist. Additionally, since we're iterating directly over the sublists, we don't need to worry about indices in this case. However, to reflect the state accurately at the start of the loop, we should acknowledge the current sublist being processed.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is 0, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
