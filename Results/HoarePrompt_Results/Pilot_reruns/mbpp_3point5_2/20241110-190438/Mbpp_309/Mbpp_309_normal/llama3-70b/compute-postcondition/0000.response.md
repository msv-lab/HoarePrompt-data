Example Answer:
The function returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`, so if `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns `a`, and if `b` is greater than `a`, the function returns `b`. The states of `a` and `b` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers and the function returns the maximum value between them.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers and the function returns the maximum value between them**
