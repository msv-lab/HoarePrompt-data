Example Answer:
The code returns the larger value between `a` and `b` using a ternary operator. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is returned; otherwise, `b` is returned. The initial values of `a` and `b` are integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers, and the function returns the larger value between them.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, and the function returns the larger value between them**
