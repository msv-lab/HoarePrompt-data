Example Answer: 
The code returns two lists, one containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists` and the other containing the second elements of each sublist. Since `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, the code will extract the first element of each sublist and create a new list with those elements, then do the same for the second element. 
Output State: **The function returns a list of all the first elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists` and a list of all the second elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists`**
