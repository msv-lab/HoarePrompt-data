The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists and incorrectly attempts to return a list of all the first elements of the sublists in list_of_lists and a list of all the second elements of the sublists in list_of_lists. However, the code has syntax errors and will not execute as intended. It should return a tuple containing two lists: one with all the first elements of the sublists, and the other with all the second elements of the sublists in list_of_lists.
