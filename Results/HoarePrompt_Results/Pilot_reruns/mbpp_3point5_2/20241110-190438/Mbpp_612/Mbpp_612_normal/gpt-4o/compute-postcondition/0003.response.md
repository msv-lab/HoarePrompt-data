The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function, it generates two lists: `first_elements`, which contains the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `second_elements`, which contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The function then returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`.
