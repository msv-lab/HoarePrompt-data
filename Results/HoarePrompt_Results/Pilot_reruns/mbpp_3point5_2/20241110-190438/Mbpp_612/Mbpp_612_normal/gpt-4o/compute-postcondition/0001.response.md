Example Answer: 
The variable `second_elements` is created by extracting the second element from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first elements of each sublist; `second_elements` is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first elements of each sublist; `second_elements` is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`**
