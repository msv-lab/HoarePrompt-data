Example Answer: 
The code returns a list containing all the first elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists` as the first element and a list containing all the second elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists` as the second element. Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements and the function returns two lists, one containing all the first elements of the sublists and the other containing all the second elements of the sublists.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements and the function returns two lists, one containing all the first elements of the sublists and the other containing all the second elements of the sublists**
