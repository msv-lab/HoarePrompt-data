The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `elem`, which is an element that can be present in the tuple. After executing the function body, the function does not return any specific output based on the input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` that can be present in the tuple.
