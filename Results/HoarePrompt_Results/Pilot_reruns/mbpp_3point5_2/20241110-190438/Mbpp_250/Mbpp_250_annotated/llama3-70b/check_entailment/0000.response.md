Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and correctly counts the occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The annotations also align with the problem description, confirming that the function behavior is as expected. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the annotations that suggest the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the code is deemed correct.
