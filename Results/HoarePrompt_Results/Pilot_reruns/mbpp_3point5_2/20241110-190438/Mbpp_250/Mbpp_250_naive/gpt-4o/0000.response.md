Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as when the element is not present in the tuple, when the element appears multiple times, and when the element appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the tuple. All test cases pass successfully, indicating that the program works as expected according to the problem description.
