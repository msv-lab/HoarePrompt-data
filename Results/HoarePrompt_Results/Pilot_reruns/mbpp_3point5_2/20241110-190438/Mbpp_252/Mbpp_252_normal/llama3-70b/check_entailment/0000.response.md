Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `c` and returns the absolute value and phase of `c`, which matches the given task. The `abs()` function returns the magnitude (absolute value) of the complex number, and `cmath.phase()` returns the phase (angle) of the complex number in radians. Since the code directly implements these mathematical operations as described in the problem statement, and there are no edge cases mentioned where this code might fail, we can conclude that the code is correct.
