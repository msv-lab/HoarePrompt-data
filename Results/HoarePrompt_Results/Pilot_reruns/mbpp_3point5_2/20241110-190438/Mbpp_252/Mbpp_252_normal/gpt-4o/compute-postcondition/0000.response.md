Example Answer:
The function `polar` from the `cmath` module is called on the complex number `num`. The function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number. Since the initial state specifies that `num` is a complex number, the `polar` function will return the magnitude and phase angle of that complex number. Therefore, the Output State is: **num is a complex number, and the function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number represented by num.**
Output State: **num is a complex number, and the function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number represented by num**
