According to the code, the loop can execute if the tuple `tup` has at least 1 item. Before the loop starts, `tup` being a tuple does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item, and `item` is the first item in the tuple.
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the tuple**
