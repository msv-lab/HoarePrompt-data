Your task is to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 items. If `item` is None, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of `tup` or any other variables. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next `item` in the tuple should be checked. Therefore, `item` should not be None in the next iteration. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 items, next `item` in the tuple is not None**
