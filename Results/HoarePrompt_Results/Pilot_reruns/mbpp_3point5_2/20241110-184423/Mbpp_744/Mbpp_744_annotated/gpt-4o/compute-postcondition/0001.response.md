Example Answer:
The program returns `True`. The state of the variables does not change with this return statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the tuple and the function returns True.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the tuple and the function returns True**
