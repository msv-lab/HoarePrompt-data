Example Answer:
The function simply returns `True`, and there are no changes to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 items where the next `item` is different from the current `item` and is not None.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 items where the next `item` is different from the current `item` and is not None**
