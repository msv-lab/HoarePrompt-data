The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. 

Case_1: If `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item and the first item is None, then the function returns True. If all items in `tup` are not None, the function does not return anything. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute.

Case_2: If `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item and the first item is None, then the function returns True. If all items in `tup` are not None, the function does not return anything. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return True if the tuple has at least 1 item and the first item is None. If all items in the tuple are not None or if the tuple is empty, the function does not return anything.
