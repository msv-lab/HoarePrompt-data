Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately implements the problem description by checking if all characters in the input string are the same. The use of `set(s)` to remove duplicates and then comparing the length of the set to 1 ensures that the function returns True only if all characters are the same. The annotations also confirm that the function is intended to do exactly this. There are no potential cases mentioned in the annotations that the code does not cover, and all examples provided in the problem description will work correctly with this function.
