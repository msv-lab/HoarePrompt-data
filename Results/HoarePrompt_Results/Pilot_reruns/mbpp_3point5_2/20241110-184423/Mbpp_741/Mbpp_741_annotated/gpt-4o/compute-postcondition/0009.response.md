According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with more than one character, and `first_char` is the first character of `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be the second character in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a string with more than one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character in `s`**
