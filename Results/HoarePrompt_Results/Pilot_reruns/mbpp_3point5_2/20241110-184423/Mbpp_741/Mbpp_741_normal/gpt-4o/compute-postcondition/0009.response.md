According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `char` is not the last character in the string. If `char` is not equal to the first character of `s`, the function returns False. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be the next character in the string after the current `char`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in the string after the current `char`**
