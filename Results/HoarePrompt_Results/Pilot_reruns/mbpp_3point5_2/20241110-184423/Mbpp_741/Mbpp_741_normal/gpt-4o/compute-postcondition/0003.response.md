According to the code, the loop will execute if the string `s` has at least 1 character. Since the function returns True, it doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `s` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the first character in the string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in the string**
