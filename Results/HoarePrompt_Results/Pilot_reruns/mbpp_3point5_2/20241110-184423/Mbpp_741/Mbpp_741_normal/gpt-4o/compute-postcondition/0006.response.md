According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `s`, as long as there are characters left in the string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the last character in the string. To execute one more time, the string `s` should still have at least one more character left to iterate over. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `char` should not be the last character in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not the last character in the string**
