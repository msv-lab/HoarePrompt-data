Example Answer:
The function returns `False`, and there are no changes to the variables `s` and `char`. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in the string after the current `char`, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in the string after the current `char`, and the function returns False**
