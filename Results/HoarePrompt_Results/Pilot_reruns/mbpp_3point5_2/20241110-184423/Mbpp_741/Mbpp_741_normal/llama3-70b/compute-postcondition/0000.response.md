Example Answer:
The code checks if the length of the set of characters in string `s` is equal to 1, indicating that all characters in the string are the same. The value of `s` is not provided, so the output state will depend on the input string `s`.
Output State: **s is a string, the function returns True if all characters in string `s` are the same, otherwise returns False.**
