The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a student name and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight. `min_height` and `min_weight` are float values representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the function returns a dictionary where each key is a student name and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight, only for students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `student_data`, and two float values `min_height` and `min_weight`, and return a filtered dictionary containing only the students who meet the height and weight criteria specified. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It returns a filtered dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
