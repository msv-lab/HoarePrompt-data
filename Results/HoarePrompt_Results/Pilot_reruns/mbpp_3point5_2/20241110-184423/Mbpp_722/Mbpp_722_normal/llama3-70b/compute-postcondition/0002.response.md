Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It filters the student data based on the given minimum height and weight criteria, returning a dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of height and weight as values for students meeting the criteria. However, there is a syntax error in the code as the dictionary comprehension is missing a closing parenthesis, which would cause the function to raise a syntax error when executed. **
