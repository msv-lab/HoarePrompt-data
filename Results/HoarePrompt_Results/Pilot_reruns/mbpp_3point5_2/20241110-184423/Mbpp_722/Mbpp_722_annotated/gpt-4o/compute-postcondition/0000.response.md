Example Answer:
The code filters out students whose height is less than min_height and weight is less than min_weight from the student_dict. It then returns a dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria. The output state is the filtered dictionary.
Output State: **Filtered dictionary containing students with height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight**
