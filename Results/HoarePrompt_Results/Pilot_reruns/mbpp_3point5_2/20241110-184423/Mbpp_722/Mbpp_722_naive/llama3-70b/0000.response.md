Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly filters out students whose height and weight are above the minimum values provided. It iterates over each student in the dictionary and checks if both the height and weight are greater than or equal to the minimum values. If the condition is met for a student, they are included in the final result. The program covers all potential cases where the height and weight need to be above the minimum values, so it is correct.
