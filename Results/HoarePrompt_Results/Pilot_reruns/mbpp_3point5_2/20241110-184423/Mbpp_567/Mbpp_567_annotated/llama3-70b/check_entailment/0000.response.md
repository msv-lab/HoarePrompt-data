Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and checks if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. This matches the problem description, which asks for a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The annotations also confirm that the function returns a boolean value indicating if all elements are in non-decreasing order. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations, and there are no cases provided where the function does not work as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
