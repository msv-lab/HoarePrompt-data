The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that can be compared with each other. The list must have at least 2 elements. It then iterates through the list and checks if any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1` for any `i` in the specified range. If this condition is met, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The function ensures that the list has at least 2 elements.
