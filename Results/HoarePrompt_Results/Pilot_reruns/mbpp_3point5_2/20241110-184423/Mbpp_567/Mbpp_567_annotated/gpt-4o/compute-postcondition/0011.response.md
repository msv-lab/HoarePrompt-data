Example Answer:
The function returns True if there is no element in the list `lst` that is greater than the element following it. The function does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements**
