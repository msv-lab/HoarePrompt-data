Example Answer:
The function returns `False`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` starts from 0, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` starts from 0, and the function returns False**
