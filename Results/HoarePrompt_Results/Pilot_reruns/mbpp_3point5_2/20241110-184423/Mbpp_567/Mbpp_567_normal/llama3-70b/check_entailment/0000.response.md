Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and checks if the elements in the list are sorted in non-decreasing order. It uses a list comprehension along with the `all()` function to check if each element is less than or equal to the next element in the list. If this condition holds for all elements except the last one, then the function returns True, indicating that the list is sorted. 

The code follows the problem description as it correctly checks if the elements are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the output hints also confirm this behavior. Additionally, the code is handling all potential cases by iterating through the list and comparing adjacent elements, ensuring that the list is sorted.
