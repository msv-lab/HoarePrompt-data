According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`lst` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
