Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly check whether the specified list is sorted or not. The second and third assert statements are failing as they return True even though the lists are not sorted. In these cases, the program fails to detect that the lists are not in ascending order. This indicates that the program is not fulfilling the problem description for all potential cases.
