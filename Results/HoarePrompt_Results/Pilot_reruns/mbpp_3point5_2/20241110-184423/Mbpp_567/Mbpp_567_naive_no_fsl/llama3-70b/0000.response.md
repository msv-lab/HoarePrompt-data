Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function that checks if a specified list is sorted or not by comparing each element with the next element. The function iterates through the list and returns True if all elements are in non-decreasing order, and False otherwise. This logic covers all potential cases and correctly determines whether the list is sorted or not.
