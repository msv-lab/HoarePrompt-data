Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`, and `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`, and `count` is increased by 1**
