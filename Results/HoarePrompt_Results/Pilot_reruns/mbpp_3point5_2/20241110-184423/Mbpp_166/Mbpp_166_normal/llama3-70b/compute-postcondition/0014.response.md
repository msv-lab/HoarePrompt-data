According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. Since `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, it ensures that the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements does not guarantee the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1 and `j` is equal to `i + 1`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1**
