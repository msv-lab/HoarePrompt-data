According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `nums`, so `i` should be adjusted to be less than the length of `nums`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `count` may have been incremented based on the XOR condition**
