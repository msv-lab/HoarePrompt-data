According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums`, so `j` should be adjusted to `i + 2`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1. `j` is equal to `i + 2`. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `count` is incremented by 1.**
