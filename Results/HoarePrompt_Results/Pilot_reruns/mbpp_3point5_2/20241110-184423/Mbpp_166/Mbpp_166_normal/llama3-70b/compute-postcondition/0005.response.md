According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` should be less than the length of `nums`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` should be less than the length of `nums`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
