Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `nums`, `i`, and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `count` is incremented by 1**
