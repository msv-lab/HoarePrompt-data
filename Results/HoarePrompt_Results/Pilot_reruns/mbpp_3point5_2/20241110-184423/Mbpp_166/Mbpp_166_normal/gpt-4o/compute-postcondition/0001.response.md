Example Answer: 
`odd_count` is assigned the value of `len(lst) - even_count`, where `len(lst)` returns the number of elements in the list `lst`. Since `even_count` represents the count of even numbers in `lst`, subtracting it from the total length of the list gives us the count of odd numbers in `lst`. Therefore, the Output State is: lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in lst, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in lst.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in lst, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in lst**
