Example Answer: 
`odd_pairs` is calculated by multiplying `odd_count` with `odd_count - 1` and then dividing the result by 2. The values of `odd_count` represent the count of odd integers in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in the list, `even_pairs` is the calculated value based on the count of even integers, and `odd_pairs` is the calculated value based on the count of odd integers.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in the list, `even_pairs` is the calculated value based on the count of even integers, and `odd_pairs` is the calculated value based on the count of odd integers**
