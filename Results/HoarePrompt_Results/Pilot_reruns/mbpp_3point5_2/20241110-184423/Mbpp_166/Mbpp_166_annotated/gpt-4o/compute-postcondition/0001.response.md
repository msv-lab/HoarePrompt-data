Example Answer:
`odd_count` is assigned the value of the length of the list `lst` minus the value of `even_count`. The previous values of `lst` and `even_count` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in the list.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in the list**
