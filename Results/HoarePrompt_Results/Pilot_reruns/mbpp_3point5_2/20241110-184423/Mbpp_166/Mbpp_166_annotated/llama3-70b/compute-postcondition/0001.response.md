According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list nums has at least one element. Before the loop starts, nums is a list of integers does not ensure that the loop will execute. The count is 0 doesn't affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, nums must have at least one element and i is 0.
State: **nums is a list of integers with at least one element, i is 0, count is 0**
