According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `nums`. No other conditions are specified that would affect the loop execution, so no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **No adjustments needed, `count` will be unchanged**
