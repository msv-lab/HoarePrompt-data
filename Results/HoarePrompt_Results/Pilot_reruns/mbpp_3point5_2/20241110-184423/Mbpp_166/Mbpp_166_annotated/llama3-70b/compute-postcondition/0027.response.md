Example Answer:
The `count` variable is incremented by 1. The previous values of other variables are not mentioned, so the output state is: `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is set to `i + 1`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is set to `i + 1`, `count` is incremented by 1**
