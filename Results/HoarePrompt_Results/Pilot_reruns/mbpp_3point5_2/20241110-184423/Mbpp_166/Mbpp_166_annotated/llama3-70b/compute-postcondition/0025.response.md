According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2. At the end of the last iteration, this condition needs to be met for the loop to execute one more time. So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1.
State: **If i is less than the length of nums minus 1**
