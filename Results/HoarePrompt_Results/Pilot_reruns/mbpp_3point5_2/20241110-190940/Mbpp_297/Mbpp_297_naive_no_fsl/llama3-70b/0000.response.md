Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function recursively flattens a nested list structure by checking each element in the list. If the element is a list, it calls the function recursively on that element. If the element is not a list, it appends the element to the flat_list. This logic ensures that all nested levels of the list are flattened correctly, making the program work as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the function covers all potential cases of nested lists and handles them appropriately, leading to a correct implementation.
