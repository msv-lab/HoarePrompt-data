Postcondition: ***nested_list is the original nested list structure without the first element. flat_list is the updated list after applying func_1 to the remaining nested lists. If element is a list, the result of applying func_1 to that list is appended to flat_list. If element is not a list, it is directly appended to flat_list. The postcondition covers all edge cases, ensuring that the program retains the initial state described in the precondition, with the appropriate modifications based on the conditions met during execution.***
