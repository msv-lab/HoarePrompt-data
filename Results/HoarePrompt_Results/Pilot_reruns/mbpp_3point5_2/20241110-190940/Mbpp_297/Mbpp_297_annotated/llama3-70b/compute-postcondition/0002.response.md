Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with the first element of `nested_list`. The result of `func_1(element)` is then added to `flat_list` using `extend`. The `flat_list` is initially empty, so it will contain the result of `func_1(element)` after the code execution. 
Output State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the result of func_1(element), element is the first element in the nested_list**
