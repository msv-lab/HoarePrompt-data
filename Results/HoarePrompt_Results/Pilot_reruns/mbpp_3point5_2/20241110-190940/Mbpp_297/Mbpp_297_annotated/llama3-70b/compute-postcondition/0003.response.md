Example Answer:
`element` is appended to `flat_list`. Since `flat_list` was initially empty and `element` is the first element of `nested_list`, the `element` is added to `flat_list`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the first element of nested_list, element is the first element in nested_list.
Output State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the first element of nested_list, element is the first element in nested_list**
