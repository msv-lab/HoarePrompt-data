The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a nested list structure where each element can be either a list or a non-list element. The output consists of two parts: 
1. `flat_list`, which is a list containing the result of applying func_1 to all nested lists within nested_list, and the first element of nested_list if it is not a list.
2. `element`, which represents the first element in the nested_list.

If nested_list is empty, the loop does not execute, and flat_list remains an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a nested list structure as input and return a flat_list and the element variable based on the conditions mentioned above. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a nested list structure with at least 1 element. It returns a flat_list containing the result of applying func_1 to all nested lists within the nested_list, and the first element of nested_list if it is not a list. The element variable represents the first element in the nested_list. If nested_list is empty, flat_list remains an empty list.**
