Example Answer:
The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. This variable is currently the only affected variable, and its initial value is an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: nested_list is a nested list structure where each element can be either a list or a non-list element; flat_list is an empty list.
Output State: **nested_list is a nested list structure where each element can be either a list or a non-list element; flat_list is an empty list**
