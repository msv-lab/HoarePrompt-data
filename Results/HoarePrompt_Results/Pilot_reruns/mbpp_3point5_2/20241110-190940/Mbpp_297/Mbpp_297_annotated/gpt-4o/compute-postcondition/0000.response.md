Example Answer:
`flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `nested_list` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list where each element is either an integer or a nested list; flat_list is an empty list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list where each element is either an integer or a nested list; flat_list is an empty list**
