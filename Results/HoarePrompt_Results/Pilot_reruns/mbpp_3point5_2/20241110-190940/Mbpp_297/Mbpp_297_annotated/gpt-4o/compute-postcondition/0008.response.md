Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list with more than 1 element. If the first element of nested_list is a list, then flat_list is extended by applying func_1 on the first element. Otherwise, if the first element of nested_list is not a list, it is appended to flat_list. The postcondition covers the cases where the first element of nested_list is either a list or not, ensuring that flat_list is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list.***
