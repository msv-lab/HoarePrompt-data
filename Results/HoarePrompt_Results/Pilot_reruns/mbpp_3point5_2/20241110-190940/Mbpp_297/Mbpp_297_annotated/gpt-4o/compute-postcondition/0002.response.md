Example Answer:
`flat_list` is extended by the result of calling `func_1` with `item`. The `item` is the first element in `nested_list`, so `func_1` is called with the first element. The function `func_1` returns a list that is appended to `flat_list`. Therefore, the output state is: nested_list is a list with at least 1 element, flat_list is filled with the result of `func_1` applied to the first element of nested_list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list with at least 1 element, flat_list is filled with the result of `func_1` applied to the first element of nested_list**
