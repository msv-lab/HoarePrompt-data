The function func_1 accepts a nested list as a parameter and returns a flattened version of the nested list where any inner nested lists have been recursively flattened. If the input nested_list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function iterates through the elements of the nested list, recursively flattening any inner nested lists, and appends non-list elements to the flat_list.
