According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list with at least 1 element and flat_list is updated based on the type of the first element in nested_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the nested_list must have more elements after the current iteration and flat_list should be updated accordingly.
State: **nested_list is a list with more than 1 element, flat_list is updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list**
