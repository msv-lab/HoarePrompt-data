According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements to iterate in the `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` is a list with more than 1 element. If the new first element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of applying `func_1` to the new first element. Otherwise, if the new first element in `nested_list` is not a list, `flat_list` appends the new first element. In both cases, `flat_list` is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in `nested_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `nested_list` must still have more elements to iterate through. If the new first element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` should be extended with the result of applying `func_1` to the new first element. If the new first element in `nested_list` is not a list, `flat_list` should append the new first element. In both cases, `flat_list` should be appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in `nested_list`.

State: **nested_list is a list with more than 1 element and there are still more elements to iterate. `flat_list` is appropriately updated based on the type of the new first element in `nested_list`.**
