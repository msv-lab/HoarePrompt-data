The function func_1 accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain nested lists. It recursively flattens out all elements from nested_list and returns the flattened list as flat_list. If nested_list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function handles both cases where elements are lists and where they are not lists to properly flatten out the nested structure.
