Postcondition: ***`nested_list` contains more elements. If the next element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended by applying `func_1` on that element. If the next element in `nested_list` is not a list, that element is appended to `flat_list`. The postcondition covers appropriate handling of elements being lists or not in the loop body.***
