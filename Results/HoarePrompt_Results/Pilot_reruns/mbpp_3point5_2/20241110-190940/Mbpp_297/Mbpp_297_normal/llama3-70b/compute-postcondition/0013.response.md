According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains more elements. To execute one more time, the next element in `nested_list` should be considered. If the next element is a list, `flat_list` will be extended by applying `func_1` on that element. If the next element is not a list, that element will be appended to `flat_list`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `nested_list` should be analyzed to determine whether it is a list or not.
State: **`nested_list` contains more elements.**
