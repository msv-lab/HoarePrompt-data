According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list contains more elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains elements returned by func_1 if element is a list, otherwise flat_list contains the appended element. The element is the first element in the nested_list. 

To execute the loop one more time, the nested_list must contain more elements, and the flat_list must be updated based on the next element in the nested_list. Additionally, the loop should handle both cases of the element being a list and not being a list to populate the flat_list correctly.

State: **nested_list contains more elements, flat_list is updated based on the next element in the nested_list, and appropriate handling of element being a list or not in the loop body**
