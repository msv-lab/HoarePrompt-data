Postcondition: ***`nested_list` contains more elements. If the next element in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` will be extended by applying `func_1` on that element. If the next element in `nested_list` is not a list, that element will be appended to `flat_list`. The program will handle all cases of elements in `nested_list`, whether they are lists or non-lists, ensuring that `flat_list` is properly constructed by either extending it with transformed list elements or appending non-list elements.***
