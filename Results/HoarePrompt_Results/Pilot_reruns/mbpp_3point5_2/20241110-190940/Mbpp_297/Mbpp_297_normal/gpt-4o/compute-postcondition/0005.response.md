According to the code, whether the loop can execute for one more time depends on the content of nested_list. If there are more items in nested_list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item. flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list as described in the postcondition.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the next item in nested_list should be considered. If the next item is a list, flat_list should be extended with the result of func_1(item). If the next item is not a list, flat_list should contain that item.

State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item, flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list, considering the next item in nested_list**
