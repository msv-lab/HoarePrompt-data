Example Answer:
`flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`. The `item` is the first item in `nested_list`, which means `func_1` is applied to the first item of `nested_list`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item, flat_list is extended with the result of func_1(item), item is the first item in nested_list**
