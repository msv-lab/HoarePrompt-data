Example Answer: 
The `func_1` function is applied to each item in the `nested_list` and the returned value is extended to `flat_list`. The `nested_list` remains unchanged, but `flat_list` is extended with the values returned by `func_1(item)`. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least two items, flat_list is extended with the values returned by func_1(item)**
