Example Answer:
The `item`, which is the first item in the `nested_list`, is appended to the `flat_list`. The `flat_list` was initially empty, so after execution, it will contain the `item`. The `nested_list` and other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item, flat_list contains the first item from nested_list, item is the first item in the nested_list**
