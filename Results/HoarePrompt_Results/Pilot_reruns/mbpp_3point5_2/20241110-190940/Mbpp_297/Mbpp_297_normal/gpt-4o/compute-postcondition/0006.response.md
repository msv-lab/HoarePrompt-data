Example Answer:
The `func_1` function is applied to each item in `nested_list`, and the result is then extended to `flat_list`. The `nested_list` remains unchanged, and `flat_list` is modified based on the items in `nested_list`. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least one item, flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list after applying func_1 to each item**
