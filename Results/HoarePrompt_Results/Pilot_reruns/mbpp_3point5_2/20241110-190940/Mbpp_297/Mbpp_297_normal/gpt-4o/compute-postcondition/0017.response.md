Functionality: **The function func_1 takes a nested list as input, potentially containing other nested lists, and flattens it into a single-level list. It iterates through the nested_list, checking each item; if an item is a list, it recursively calls func_1 on that sublist, and if it is not a list, it appends the item to the flat_list. The function returns the flattened list. If nested_list is empty or contains only non-list items, the flat_list remains empty.**
