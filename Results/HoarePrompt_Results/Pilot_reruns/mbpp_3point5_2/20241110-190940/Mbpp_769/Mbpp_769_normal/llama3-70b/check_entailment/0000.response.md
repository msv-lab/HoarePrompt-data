Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2`, finds the symmetric difference of the two lists (elements that are in either of the lists but not in their intersection), and returns a sorted list of these elements. The code uses set operations to efficiently find the symmetric difference and then sorts the result before returning it. By following the problem description, the code covers all potential cases and produces the expected output.
