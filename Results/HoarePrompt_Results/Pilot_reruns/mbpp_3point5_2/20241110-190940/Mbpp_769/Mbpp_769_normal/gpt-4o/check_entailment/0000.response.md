Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` takes two lists as input, creates sets from each list, calculates the symmetric difference between the two sets, and returns a list of elements resulting from the symmetric difference operation, sorted based on the indices of the elements in the concatenated input lists `list1` and `list2`.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases provided.
- The output hints also agree with the code and do not provide any counterexamples where the code would fail to meet the problem description.
- Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
