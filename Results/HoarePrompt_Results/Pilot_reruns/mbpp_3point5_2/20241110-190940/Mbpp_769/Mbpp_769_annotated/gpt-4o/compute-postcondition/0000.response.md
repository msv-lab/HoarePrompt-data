Example Answer: 
A set `set1` is created from the elements of `list1`. The values in `list1` are used to create `set1`, so `set1` contains the unique elements present in `list1`. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists containing elements that support comparison operations; set1 is a set containing unique elements from list1**
