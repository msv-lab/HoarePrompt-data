Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly uses the set symmetric difference operator (^) to find the elements that are present in either of the two lists, but not in both. It then sorts the result and returns it, which satisfies the problem description of getting the difference between two lists. The program seems to work correctly for all potential cases.
