Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function that takes a string `s` as input and replaces all spaces in the string with '%20', as required by the problem description. The implementation simply uses the `replace` method of strings in Python to achieve this, which is a valid and straightforward approach to solving the problem. The code annotations also confirm that the function returns the modified string with spaces replaced by '%20. 

Since the code does exactly what the problem description asks for and there are no potential cases mentioned in the annotations where the code fails, we can conclude that the code is correct.
