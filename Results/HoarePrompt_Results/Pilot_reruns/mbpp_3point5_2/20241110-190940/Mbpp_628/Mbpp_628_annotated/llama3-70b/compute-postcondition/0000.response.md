Example Answer:
The function returns the string `s` with spaces replaced by '%20'. Since the initial state is that `s` is a string, the function will replace spaces with '%20'. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string and the function returns the modified string with spaces replaced by '%20'.
Output State: **s is a string and the function returns the modified string with spaces replaced by '%20'**
