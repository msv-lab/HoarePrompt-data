Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to follow the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the input tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first tuple found if any, and returns the length of the tuple if no tuple is present. The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly identifies the index of the first tuple element in the tuple. Additionally, the output hints also confirm the code's functionality by mentioning that the function returns the index of the first tuple found or the length of the tuple if no tuple is present. Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, it can be concluded that the code is correct.
