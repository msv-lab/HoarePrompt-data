Example Answer:
The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is the first element in `tup`, its index is 0. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple containing at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `tup`, and the function returns 0.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `tup`, and the function returns 0**
