The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements. If at least one of the elements in `tup` is a tuple, the function returns the index of the first tuple found. If none of the elements are tuples, the function returns the length of the input `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to iterate through the elements of the input tuple `tup`, return the index of the first tuple found if any, and return the length of the tuple if no tuple is present.
