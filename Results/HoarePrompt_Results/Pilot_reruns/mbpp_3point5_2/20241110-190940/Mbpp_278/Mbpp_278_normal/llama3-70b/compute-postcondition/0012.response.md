The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements. If at least one of the elements in `tup` is a tuple, the function returns the index of the first tuple found. If none of the elements are tuples, the function does not execute and there is no change in the state of the program variables. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple `tup` containing elements and return the index of the first tuple found, if any. If no tuple is found, the function does not execute.
