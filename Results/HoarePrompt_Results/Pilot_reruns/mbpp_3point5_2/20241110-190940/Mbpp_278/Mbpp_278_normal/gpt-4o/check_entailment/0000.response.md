Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem description. The function iterates through the tuple `tup` and counts the number of elements before encountering the first tuple element. This logic is consistent with the problem description, and the provided examples also return the expected output. Additionally, the output hints align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the code is correct.
