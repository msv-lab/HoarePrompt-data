The function func_1 accepts a tuple parameter `tup` containing elements of any data type. It then iterates through the tuple until it encounters the first tuple element, counting the number of elements before that occurrence. If `tup` does not contain any tuple elements, `count` will be equal to the total number of elements in the tuple. If `tup` is an empty tuple, `count` will remain 0.
