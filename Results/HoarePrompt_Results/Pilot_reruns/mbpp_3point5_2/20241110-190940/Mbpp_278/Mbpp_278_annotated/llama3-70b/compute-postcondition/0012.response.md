The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples. If there is at least one tuple in `tup`, the function will return the index of the first tuple encountered in `tup`. If there are no tuples in `tup`, the function will not execute the loop and no changes will be made to the initial state. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the index of the first tuple encountered in `tup`, if any. If there are no tuples in `tup`, no changes will be made to the initial state.
