Example Answer:
The function returns the index of `elem` within the tuple `tup`. The output state will depend on the actual values of `tup` and `elem`, which are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `tup` is a tuple containing elements with at least two elements, `elem` is an instance of tuple, and the function returns the index of `elem` within `tup`.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements with at least two elements, `elem` is an instance of tuple, and the function returns the index of `elem` within `tup`**
