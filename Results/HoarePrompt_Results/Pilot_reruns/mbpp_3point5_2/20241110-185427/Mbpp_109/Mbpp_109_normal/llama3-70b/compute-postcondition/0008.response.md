According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `temp` needs to be updated to the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + len(s)`.
- `count` needs to be updated by adding the count of '1' in `temp` modulo 2.
State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `s` is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 2 and ending at index 2 + len(s), `count` is updated by adding the count of '1' in `temp` modulo 2**
