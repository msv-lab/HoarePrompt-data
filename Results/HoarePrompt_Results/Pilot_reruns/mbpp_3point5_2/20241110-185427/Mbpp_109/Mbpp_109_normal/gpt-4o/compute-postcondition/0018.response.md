Output State: **`binary_str` is the final rotated binary string after `num_rotations` iterations, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of times the rotated binary string resulted in an odd integer value after applying the specified number of rotations. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0. The function returns the value of `count`.**
