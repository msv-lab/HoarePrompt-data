Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`.
- It rotates the binary string by the specified number of iterations and counts the number of times the rotated binary string results in an odd integer value.
- If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0.
- The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description for all potential cases.
- The output hints also align with the code, confirming that it follows the problem description accurately.
- The provided examples also work correctly, indicating that the program is handling the rotations and odd value calculations accurately.
