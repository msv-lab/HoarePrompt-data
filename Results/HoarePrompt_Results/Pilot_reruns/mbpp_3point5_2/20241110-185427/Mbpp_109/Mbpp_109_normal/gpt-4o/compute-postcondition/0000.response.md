Example Answer:
The variable `count` is assigned the value 0. There are no other affected variables, so the output state is: binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0.
Output State: **binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0**
