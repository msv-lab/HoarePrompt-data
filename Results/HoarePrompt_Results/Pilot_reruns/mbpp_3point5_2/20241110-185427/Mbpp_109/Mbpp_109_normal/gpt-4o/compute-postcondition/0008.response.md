Example Answer:
The code converts the binary string `binary_str` into an integer and assigns it to `integer_value`. The value of `binary_str` is rotated binary string, and `num_rotations` is greater than 1, so `integer_value` will hold the integer value of the rotated binary string. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1; `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1; `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string**
