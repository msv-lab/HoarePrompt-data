Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a binary string 's' and an integer 'n' as input. It then rotates the binary string 's' 'n' times and counts the number of numbers with an odd value in each rotation. The program correctly handles the given problem description by rotating the string 'n' times and counting the number of odd values in each rotation. The logic used to count the odd values is also correct as it checks for the count of '1' in each rotation and takes the modulo 2 to determine if it is odd. Since the program follows the problem description and the logic used is correct, the correctness of the program is True.
