Correctness: **False**

For the given program, the issue lies in the binary string rotation logic. When rotating the binary string, the program is not considering all possible rotations. It only rotates the string by moving the last character to the front in each iteration. This approach may miss some rotations that could result in odd integer values. 

For example, consider the binary string '011001' with 6 rotations:
- Original: '011001'
- After 1 rotation: '101001' (odd number)
- After 2 rotations: '110100' (even number)
- After 3 rotations: '011010' (even number)
- After 4 rotations: '001101' (odd number)
- After 5 rotations: '100110' (even number)
- After 6 rotations: '010011' (odd number)

In this case, the expected result should be 3 odd numbers, but the program may not account for all possible rotations, leading to an incorrect count of odd values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
