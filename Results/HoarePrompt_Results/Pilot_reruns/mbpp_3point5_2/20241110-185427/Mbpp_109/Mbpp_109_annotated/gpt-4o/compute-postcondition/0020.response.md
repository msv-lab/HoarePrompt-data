Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a binary string, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. The function rotates `binary_str` based on the number of rotations specified, calculates the integer value of the rotated binary string, and increments `count` if the integer value is odd. The final count value is returned. The loop may not execute if `num_rotations` is 0 or if the initial `binary_str` is not a valid binary string.**
