Example Answer: 
The variable `count` is initialized to 0. Since there are no other operations affecting the variables, the output state is: binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0.
Output State: **binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0**
