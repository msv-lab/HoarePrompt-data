The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a binary string, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. The function updates `count` based on the integer value of `binary_str`. If the integer value of `binary_str` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1. The loop may not execute if `num_rotations` is 0 or if the initial `binary_str` is not a valid binary string. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, update `count` based on the integer value of `binary_str`, and increment `count` by 1 if the integer value of `binary_str` is odd. The loop may not execute if `num_rotations` is 0 or if the initial `binary_str` is not a valid binary string.
