Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem description. It takes in a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, rotates the binary string the specified number of times, calculates the integer value of the rotated binary string, and increments a count if the integer value is odd. The final count is returned. The code annotations provide a detailed explanation of the program's behavior, including scenarios where the loop may not execute if `num_rotations` is 0 or if the initial `binary_str` is not a valid binary string. However, based on the code and the problem description, the program handles all potential cases correctly.
