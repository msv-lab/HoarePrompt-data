According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `num_rotations` needs to be greater than 0. Additionally, since the loop does not directly use `binary_str` and `count`, their values do not affect the execution of the loop. 
State: **`binary_str` is a binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
