Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + len(s)`. The value of `i` is not provided, so the specific substring cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is either 0 or 1**
