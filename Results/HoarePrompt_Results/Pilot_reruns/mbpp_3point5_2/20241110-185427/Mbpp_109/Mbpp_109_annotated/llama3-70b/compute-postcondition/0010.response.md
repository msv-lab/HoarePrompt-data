Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is checked for the count of '1', and this count is added to `count`. The count can be either 0 or 1, and the count of '1' in `temp` is added modulo 2 to `count`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next integer value after the last iteration, `temp` is a substring of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next integer value after the last iteration, `temp` is a substring of `s`**
