Example Answer:
The string `s` is repeated a number of times to match the length of `s` to the closest multiple of `n`. If the length of `s` is 5 and `n` is 12, `s` will be repeated 3 times to make the length 15. Therefore, the final length of the string `s` will be a multiple of `n`. 
Output State: **s is a binary string, n is a non-negative integer**
