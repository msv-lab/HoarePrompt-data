Example Answer:
`first_index` is assigned the value of the first index of character `ch` in string `s` using the `find` method. If the character `ch` is not found in string `s`, the value of `first_index` will be -1. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, ch is a character, first_index is either the index of ch in s or -1.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a character, first_index is either the index of ch in s or -1**
