Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations suggest that if the character `ch` is not found in the string `s`, or if it is found only once at the same position, the function should return the original string `s`. However, the code does not handle the case where `ch` is found only once at the same position correctly. 

For example, if the input string is "hello" and the character to be removed is 'h', the code will incorrectly remove both occurrences of 'h' resulting in the output "ello" instead of returning the original string "hello". 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect. The annotations did not influence the reasoning in this case as the discrepancy was found by comparing the code behavior to the problem description directly.
