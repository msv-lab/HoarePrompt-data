Example Answer:
The function returns a modified version of the string `s` by removing the character at index `first_index` and the character at index `last_index`. If `first_index` is -1, `last_index` is -1, or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, then the original string `s` is returned. There is no change in the values of the variables `s`, `ch`, `first_index`, and `last_index`.
Output State: **No change in the state of the variables, the function returns the modified string based on the given conditions**
