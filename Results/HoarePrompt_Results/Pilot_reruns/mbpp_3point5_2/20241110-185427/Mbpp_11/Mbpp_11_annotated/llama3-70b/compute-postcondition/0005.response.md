The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` which is a string and `c` which is a character. It also returns two values, `first_occ` which is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, and `last_occ` which is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`. Based on the values of `first_occ` and `last_occ`, the function returns a substring of `s` obtained by removing the character at index `first_occ` and `last_occ` if both indices are not equal to -1. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, the function returns the original string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, find the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`, and return a modified substring of `s` based on these occurrences. If the character is not found in the string, the original string `s` is returned.
