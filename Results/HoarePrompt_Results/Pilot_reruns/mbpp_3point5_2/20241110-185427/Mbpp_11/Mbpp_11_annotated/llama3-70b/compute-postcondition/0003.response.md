Example Answer: 
The function returns the string `s`. The variables `s`, `c`, `first_occ`, and `last_occ` are not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`**
