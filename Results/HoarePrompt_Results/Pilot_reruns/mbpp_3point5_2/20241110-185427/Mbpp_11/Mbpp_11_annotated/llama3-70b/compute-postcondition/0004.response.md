Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns a substring of `s` obtained by removing the character at index `first_occ` and `last_occ`. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, the function returns the original string `s`.***
