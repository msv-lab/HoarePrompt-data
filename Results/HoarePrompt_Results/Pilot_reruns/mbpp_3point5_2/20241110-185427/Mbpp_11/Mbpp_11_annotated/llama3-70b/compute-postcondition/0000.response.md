Example Answer: 
The index of the first occurrence of character `c` in string `s` is assigned to `first_occ`. If `c` is found in `s`, `first_occ` will be the index of the first occurrence starting from 0. If `c` is not found in `s`, `first_occ` will be -1. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, c is a character, and first_occ is the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1 if c is not found.
Output State: **s is a string, c is a character, and first_occ is the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1 if c is not found**
