Example Answer:
The `find()` method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If the character is found, `first_index` will be assigned the index value. If the character is not found, `-1` will be assigned to `first_index`. The state of variables `s` and `ch` remains unchanged.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a single character string, first_index is either the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1**
