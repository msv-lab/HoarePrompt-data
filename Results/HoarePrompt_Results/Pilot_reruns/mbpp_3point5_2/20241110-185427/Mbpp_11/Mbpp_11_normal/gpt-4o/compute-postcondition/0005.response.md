The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `ch`. `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. The function also has two local variables `first_index` and `last_index`, which represent the index of the first and last occurrence of `ch` in `s` respectively, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. 

In Case_1, if either `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns `s`. If none of these conditions are met, the function does not modify the input variables and continues to the next part of the program.

In Case_2, the conditions are the same as in Case_1. If either `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns `s`. If none of these conditions are met, the function does not modify the input variables and continues to the next part of the program.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, find the first and last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and return `s` if certain conditions are met. If the conditions are not met, the function continues without modifying the input variables.
