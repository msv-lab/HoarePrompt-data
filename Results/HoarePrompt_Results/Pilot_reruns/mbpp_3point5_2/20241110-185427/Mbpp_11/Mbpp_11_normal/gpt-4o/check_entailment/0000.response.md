Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, then finds the first and last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If the first occurrence, last occurrence, or both are not found, or if the first and last occurrences are the same, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it removes the characters between the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s` and returns the modified string. The code correctly implements this logic and the provided examples also work as expected.
