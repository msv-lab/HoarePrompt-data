Example Answer:
The variable `last_index` is assigned the result of calling the `rfind` method on the string `s` with the character `ch`. If `ch` is found in `s`, `last_index` will be the index of the last occurrence of `ch`, otherwise, it will be -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, ch is a single character string, first_index is either the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1, last_index is either the index of the last occurrence of ch in s or -1.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a single character string, first_index is either the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1, last_index is either the index of the last occurrence of ch in s or -1**
