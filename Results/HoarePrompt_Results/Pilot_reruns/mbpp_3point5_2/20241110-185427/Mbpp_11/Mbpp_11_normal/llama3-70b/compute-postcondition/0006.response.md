Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `c`. It finds the first and last occurrences of the character `c` in the string `s`. If both occurrences are found, it returns a modified string by removing the character at those indexes. If either occurrence is not found, the original string `s` is returned.**
