Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. 

For example, if we have the input string "hello" and the character "l", the program will output "hlo" instead of "hlo" as expected. This is because the program incorrectly removes the character at the first occurrence index and also includes the character at the last occurrence index, resulting in incorrect output.
