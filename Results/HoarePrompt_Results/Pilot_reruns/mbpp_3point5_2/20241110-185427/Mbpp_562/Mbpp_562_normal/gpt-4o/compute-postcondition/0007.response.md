According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more sublists in the list_of_lists. At the end of the last iteration, list_of_lists has at least 2 sublists. To execute one more time, the list_of_lists must have at least 3 sublists. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `max_length` remains unchanged**
