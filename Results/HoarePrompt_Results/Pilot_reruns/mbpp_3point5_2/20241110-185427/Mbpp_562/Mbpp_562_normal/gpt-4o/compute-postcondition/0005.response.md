Example Answer:
The variable `max_length` is updated to the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the length of the first sublist is greater than the current value of `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to that length. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is updated to the length of the first sublist or remains unchanged at its current value**
