Example Answer:
The length of `sublist` is calculated and assigned to `max_length`. Since `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, the length of `sublist` determines the value of `max_length`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`**
