Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the list of lists provided in the test cases. It iterates through each sublist and updates the `max_length` variable if it encounters a longer sublist. The test cases cover different scenarios such as sublists of varying lengths and the program passes all of them. Therefore, the program is correct.
