Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a list of sublists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. It correctly uses a generator expression to find the length of each sublist and then uses the `max` function to return the length of the longest sublist. This implementation covers all potential cases as it accurately identifies the length of the longest sublist in the input list.
