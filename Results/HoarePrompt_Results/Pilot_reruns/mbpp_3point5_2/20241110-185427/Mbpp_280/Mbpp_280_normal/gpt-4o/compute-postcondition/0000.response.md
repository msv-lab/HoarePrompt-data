According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, index is 0 and value is the first element in the list arr. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, index is 0, and value is the first element in the list arr.
State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, index is 0, value is the first element in the list arr**
