Example Answer: 
The function returns `True` and `index`, where `index` is 1. The initial state indicates that `index` is 1, so the function returns `True, 1`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, `value` is the second element in the list `arr`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, `value` is the second element in the list `arr`**
