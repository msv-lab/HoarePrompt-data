According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are still elements in the list `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `index` is set to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the `index` needs to be adjusted to 3 since it represents the index of the element to be processed next.
State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `index` is set to 3**
