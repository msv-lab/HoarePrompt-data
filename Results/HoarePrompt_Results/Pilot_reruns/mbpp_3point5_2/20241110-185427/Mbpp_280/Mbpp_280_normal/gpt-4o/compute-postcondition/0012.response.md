The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` of elements and a single element `element`. The elements in `arr` and `element` can be compared for equality. 

After executing the function body, there are two cases:
Case 1: If the `element` is present in the `arr`, the function will return True along with the index of the `element` in the list. If the `element` is not found in `arr`, the function will return False.
Case 2: If the `element` is present in the `arr`, the function will return True along with the index of the `element` in the list. If the `element` is not found in `arr`, the function will return False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of elements and a single element `element`, and return True along with the index of the `element` in the list if the `element` is present in the `arr`. If the `element` is not found in `arr`, the function will return False.
