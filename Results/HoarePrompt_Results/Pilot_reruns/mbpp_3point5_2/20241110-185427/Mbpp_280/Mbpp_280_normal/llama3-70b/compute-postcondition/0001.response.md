Example Answer:
The function returns `True` and the value of `i`, which is 0. The state of the variables does not change, so the output state is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least one element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`, and the function returns True, 0.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least one element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`, and the function returns True, 0**
