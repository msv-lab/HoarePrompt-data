Example Answer:
The function returns `True` and the value of `i`, which is 2. The state of variables `arr` and `x` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `arr`, and the function returns True and 2.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `arr`, and the function returns True and 2**
