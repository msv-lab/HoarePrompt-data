Example Answer:
The function returns `True` and the value of `i` which is 2. The variables `arr` and `elem` are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `elem` is a single element, `i` is 2, `x` is the second element in arr and the function returns True and 2.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `elem` is a single element, `i` is 2, `x` is the second element in arr and the function returns True and 2**
