Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem`, then iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, the function returns True along with the index position of the element. If the element is not found, it returns False and -1, as specified in the problem description. The annotations provided also confirm the behavior of the code, further supporting the correctness of the program.
