According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `elem` is a single element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` should be incremented to 1, and `x` should be the second element in the list.
State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, elem is a single element, i is 1, x is the second element in arr**
