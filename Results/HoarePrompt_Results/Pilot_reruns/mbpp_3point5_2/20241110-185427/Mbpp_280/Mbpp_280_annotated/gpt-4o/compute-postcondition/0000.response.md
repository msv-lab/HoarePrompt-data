According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `arr` has at least 1 element. The loop variable `index` will start from 0 and `value` will be the value of the first element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `arr` is a non-empty list, `index` is 0, and `value` is the value of the first element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `index` is 0, `value` is the value of the first element in the list**
