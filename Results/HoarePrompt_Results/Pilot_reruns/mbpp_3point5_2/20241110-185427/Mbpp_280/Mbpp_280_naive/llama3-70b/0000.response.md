Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the array using enumerate to get both the index and the element at that index. It then checks if the current element is equal to the input element. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple containing True and the index position. If no match is found after iterating through the entire array, it returns a tuple containing False and -1. The logic follows the problem description accurately and covers all potential cases, making the program correct.
