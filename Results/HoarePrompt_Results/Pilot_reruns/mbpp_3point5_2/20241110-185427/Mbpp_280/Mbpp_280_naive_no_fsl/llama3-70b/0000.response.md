Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function iterates through the input array and checks if the element is equal to the current element being iterated. If a match is found, it returns a tuple with True indicating the element is in the array and the index position of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
