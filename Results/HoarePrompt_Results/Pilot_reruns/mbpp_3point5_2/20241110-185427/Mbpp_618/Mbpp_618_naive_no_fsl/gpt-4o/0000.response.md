Correctness: True

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two lists and divides the elements of the first list by the elements of the second list element-wise using list comprehension and the `zip` function. The provided test cases all pass and the function correctly divides the elements of the two lists as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
