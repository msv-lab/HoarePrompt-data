Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Otherwise, the function returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of list1 by list2.**
