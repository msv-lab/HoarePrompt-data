The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`. The precondition for the function is that `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers such that `len(list1) == len(list2)` and all elements in `list2` are non-zero. After executing the function body, the function returns a list containing the results of the division operations of the corresponding elements in `list1` and `list2`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists `list1` and `list2`. It returns a list containing the results of the division operations of the corresponding elements in `list1` and `list2`.**
