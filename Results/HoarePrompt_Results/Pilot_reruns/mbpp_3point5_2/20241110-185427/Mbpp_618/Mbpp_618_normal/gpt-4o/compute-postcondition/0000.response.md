Example Answer:
Each element in list1 is divided by the corresponding element in list2 using list comprehension. Since list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length and list2 does not contain any zeros, the division is valid. Therefore, the output state is: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers such that len(list1) == len(list2) and list2 does not contain any zeros.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of numbers such that len(list1) == len(list2) and list2 does not contain any zeros**
