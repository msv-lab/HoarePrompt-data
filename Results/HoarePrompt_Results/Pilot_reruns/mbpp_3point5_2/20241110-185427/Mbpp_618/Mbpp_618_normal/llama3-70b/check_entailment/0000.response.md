Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input, checks if they are of the same length, and then performs element-wise division on the corresponding elements of the two lists using list comprehension. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a `ValueError` is raised, as specified in the problem description. The output hints also align with the code by stating that the function divides each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. Since the code meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and the output hints further confirm this behavior, we can conclude that the code is correct.
