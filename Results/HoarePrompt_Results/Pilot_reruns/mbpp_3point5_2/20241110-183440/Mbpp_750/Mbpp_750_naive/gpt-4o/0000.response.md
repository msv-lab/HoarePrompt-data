Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list using the `list()` function, and then concatenates it with the given list `lst` using the `+` operator. The program then asserts that the output of `func_1` with the given inputs matches the expected output for all test cases. Since the function accurately adds the given tuple to the given list and passes all the test cases, it can be considered correct.
