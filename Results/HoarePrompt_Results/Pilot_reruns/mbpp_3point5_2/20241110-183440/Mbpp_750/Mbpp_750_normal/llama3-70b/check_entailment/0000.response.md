Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input parameters and returns a new list that is formed by concatenating the elements of the tuple `tup` to the list `lst`. The code simply converts the tuple `tup` to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenates it to the list `lst` using the `+` operator. This implementation aligns with the problem description of adding the given tuple to the given list. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided in the problem description or output hints that suggest the code may not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
