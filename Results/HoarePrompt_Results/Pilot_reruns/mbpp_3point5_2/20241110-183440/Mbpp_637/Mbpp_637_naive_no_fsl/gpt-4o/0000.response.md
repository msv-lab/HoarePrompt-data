Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. If they are equal, then there is neither profit nor loss, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases cover scenarios where the cost price is not equal to the selling price, and the function returns the correct results. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
