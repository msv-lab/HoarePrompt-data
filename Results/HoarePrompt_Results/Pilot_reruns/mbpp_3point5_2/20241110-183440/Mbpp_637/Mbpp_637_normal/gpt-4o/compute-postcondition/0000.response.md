Example Answer:
The return statement checks if cost_price is equal to selling_price and returns True if they are equal, False otherwise. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for cost_price and selling_price, the output state will vary based on their values.
Output State: **No specific output state, as it depends on the values of cost_price and selling_price**
