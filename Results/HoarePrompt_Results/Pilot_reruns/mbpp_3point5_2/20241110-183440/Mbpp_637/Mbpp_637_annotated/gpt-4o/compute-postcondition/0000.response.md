Example Answer: 
The code checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price and returns True if they are equal, otherwise False. The initial state is cost_price and selling_price are integers. Therefore, if the cost price is equal to the selling price, the function will return True, otherwise False.
Output State: **cost_price and selling_price are integers, and the function returns False**
