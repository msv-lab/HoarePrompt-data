Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function that takes in two parameters, cost_price and selling_price, and simply checks if they are equal. This is in line with the problem description which asks to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. The annotations also confirm that the function returns True if the cost_price and selling_price are equal, which aligns with the problem statement. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that suggest the code does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
