Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative numbers. It calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula V = Ï€ * radius^2 * height and returns the result. The code does not handle edge cases such as division by zero or negative inputs. However, based on the description and the code provided, it seems to be correctly calculating the volume of a cylinder for valid inputs. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the code.
