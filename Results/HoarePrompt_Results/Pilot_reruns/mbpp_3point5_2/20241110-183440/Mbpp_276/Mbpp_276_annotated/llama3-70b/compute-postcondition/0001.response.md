The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the volume of the cylinder calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and then return the volume of the cylinder based on these input values.
