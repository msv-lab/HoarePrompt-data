Example Answer:
The variable `volume` is calculated using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The value of `volume` depends on the values of `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative numbers. After the calculation, the `volume` will be assigned the result of the formula. Therefore, the Output State is: radius and height are non-negative numbers, volume is the calculated volume based on the given formula.
Output State: **radius and height are non-negative numbers, volume is the calculated volume based on the given formula**
