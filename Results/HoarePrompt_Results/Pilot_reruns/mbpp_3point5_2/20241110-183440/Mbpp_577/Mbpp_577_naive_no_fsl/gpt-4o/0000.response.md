Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The logic to return 0 if n is greater than or equal to 5 is incorrect. For example:
- func_1(21) should return 1, as the last digit of 21! is 1, not 0 as the program asserts.
- func_1(30) should return 0, as the last digit of 30! is 0, not 0 as the program asserts.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
