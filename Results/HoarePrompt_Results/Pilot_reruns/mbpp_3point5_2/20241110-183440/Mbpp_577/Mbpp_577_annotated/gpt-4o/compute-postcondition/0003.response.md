The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. The factorial is initialized to 1 in this case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial.
