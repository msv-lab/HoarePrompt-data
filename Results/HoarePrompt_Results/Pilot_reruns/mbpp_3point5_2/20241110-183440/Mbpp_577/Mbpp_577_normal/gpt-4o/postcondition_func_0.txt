The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the factorial. If n is less than 5, the factorial is computed incorrectly as it should include numbers from 1 to n, inclusive, but the code only considers the last digit, potentially leading to incorrect results.
