Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number for all potential cases. The program only returns specific values for certain input values without actually calculating the factorial and finding the last digit. For example, for input values greater than 4, the program simply returns 0, which is not the correct last digit of the factorial.
