Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` should find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. However, the program is incorrectly returning 0 for any input greater than or equal to 5. This is incorrect because not all factorials of numbers greater than or equal to 5 end in 0. For example, the factorial of 21 is 51090942171709440000, which ends in 0, but the factorial of 30 is 265252859812191058636308480000000, which does not end in 0.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the correctness should be **False**.
