According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not divisible by 2, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2. Since `num` being greater than or equal to 2 does not guarantee that the loop will execute again, `num` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is greater than 3, `i` is 2**
