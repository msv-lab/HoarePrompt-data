Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than or equal to 4, the function calculates prime numbers and returns the sum of the resulting list `is_prime`. The code initializes a list `is_prime` with True values, marks indexes 0 and 1 as False, and then iterates to mark multiples of prime numbers as False within the range specified. **
