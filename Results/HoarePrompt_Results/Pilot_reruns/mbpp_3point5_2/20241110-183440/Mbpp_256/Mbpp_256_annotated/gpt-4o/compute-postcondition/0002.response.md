Example Answer:
The list `is_prime` is assigned a list of `n` elements where each element is set to `True`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0, and the state of the program variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0, otherwise, there is no change in the state.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, and if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0, otherwise, there is no change in the state**
