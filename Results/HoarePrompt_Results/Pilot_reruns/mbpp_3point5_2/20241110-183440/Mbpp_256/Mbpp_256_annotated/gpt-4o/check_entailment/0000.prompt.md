You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 0
        #State of the program after the return statement: n is a non-negative integer and the function returns 0
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: n is a non-negative integer and the function returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. In all other cases where n is greater than 2, there is no change to the state of the program variables.
    is_prime = [True] * n
    #State of the program here: `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0, otherwise, there is no change in the state
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    #State of the program here: `n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is less than 4, the loop does not execute. If n is at least 4, the loop will iterate over the range from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive). For each prime number found, the loop will mark all multiples of that number as False in the is_prime list. The final state will have n as at least 4, i as the last value before the loop ends, is_prime[0] and is_prime[1] as False, and is_prime[j] as False for all j in the range of i * i to n with a step of i.
    return sum(is_prime)
    #State of the program after the return statement: n is at least 4, i is the last value before the loop ends, is_prime[0] and is_prime[1] are False, and is_prime[j] is False for all j in the range of i * i to n with a step of i, and the function returns the sum of is_prime
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than or equal to 4, the function calculates prime numbers and returns the sum of the resulting list `is_prime`. The code initializes a list `is_prime` with True values, marks indexes 0 and 1 as False, and then iterates to mark multiples of prime numbers as False within the range specified.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
