According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime[0]` is False, and `is_prime[1]` is False. Since `i` is 3, which is at least 2, the loop will execute one more time. The loop will set `is_prime[j]` to False for each `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. Therefore, to adjust the states for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to 4.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False**
