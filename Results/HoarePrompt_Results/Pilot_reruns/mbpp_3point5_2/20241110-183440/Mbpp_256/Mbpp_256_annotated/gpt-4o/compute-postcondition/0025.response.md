According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is at least 4 and `n` is at least 4. Before the loop starts, `is_prime[j]` needs to be set to `False` for all values of `j` within the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. So, the states that need to be adjusted are: `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`**
