According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the range of `j`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `i * i`, and `i` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `is_prime` values for 0 and 1 are not relevant to the loop execution. For the loop to execute, `j` must start from `i * i`, so the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `j` is equal to `i * i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `j` is equal to `i * i`**
