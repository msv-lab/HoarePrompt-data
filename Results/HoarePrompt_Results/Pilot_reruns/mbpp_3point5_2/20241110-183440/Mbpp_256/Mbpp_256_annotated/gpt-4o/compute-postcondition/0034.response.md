According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` does not reach a value where `i * i >= n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is the last value before the loop ended, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` needs to be calculated. Since the loop ranges from 2 to the square root of `n` + 1, the next value for `i` would be the current `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is the last value before the loop ended + 1, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`**
