According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, and the loop should check if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False**
