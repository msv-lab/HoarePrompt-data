Example Answer:
The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to False. Given that `j` is equal to `i * i`, and `i` is at least 2, `j` is greater than or equal to `i * i`. The initial state states that `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, so the value of `is_prime[j]` will always be False. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is always False.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is at least 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is always False**
