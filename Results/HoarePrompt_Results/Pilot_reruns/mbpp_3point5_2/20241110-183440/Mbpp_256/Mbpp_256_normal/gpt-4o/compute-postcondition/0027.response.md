According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Since `i` is 4, the next value of `j` should be `i * i` + `i`, which is 4 * 4 + 4 = 20. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, `is_prime[j]` is False**
