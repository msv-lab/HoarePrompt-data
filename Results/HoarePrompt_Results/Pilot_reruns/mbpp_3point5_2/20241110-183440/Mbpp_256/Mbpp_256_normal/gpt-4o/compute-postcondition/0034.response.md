According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is less than `i * i` and `is_prime[i]` is True. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5.
- `is_prime[5]` should be checked to see if it's True. If it is True, the loop will iterate again.
- No other states need adjustment.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 5, `j` is equal to `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False**
