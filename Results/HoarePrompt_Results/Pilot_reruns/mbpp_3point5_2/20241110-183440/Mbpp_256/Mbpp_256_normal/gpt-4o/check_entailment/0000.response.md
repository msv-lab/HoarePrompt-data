Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` takes in a non-negative integer `n` and correctly handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 2 by returning 0.
- For `n` greater than 2, the function implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify prime numbers up to the square root of `n` and then calculates their sum.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly identifies prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming its correctness.
