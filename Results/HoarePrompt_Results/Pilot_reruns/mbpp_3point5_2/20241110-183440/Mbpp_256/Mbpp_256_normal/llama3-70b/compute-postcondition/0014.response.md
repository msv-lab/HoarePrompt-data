The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False.

Case_2: If `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `num`. If it is divisible, the function returns False; otherwise, it continues without changing the variables.

Case_3: If `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `num`. If it is divisible, the function returns False; otherwise, it continues without changing the variables.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and return False if `num` is less than 2 or if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `num`. If `num` is not divisible by any number in that range, the function returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number.
