The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns False if `num` is less than 2. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True, indicating `num` is a prime number.
