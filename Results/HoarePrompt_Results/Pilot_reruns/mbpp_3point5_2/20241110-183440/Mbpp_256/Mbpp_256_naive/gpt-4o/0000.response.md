Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program defines a function that takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given number. The function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to `n`. It marks all multiples of each prime number as not prime.

The function has been tested with multiple test cases, including `5`, `10`, and `100`, and it produces the expected output for all of them. Additionally, the algorithm used in the function is a known and efficient method for finding prime numbers, ensuring correctness for all potential cases.
