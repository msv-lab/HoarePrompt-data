Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next one.
2. If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the next one, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
3. If it completes the iteration without finding any such instance, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The assertions provided in the code also validate the correctness:
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True`, which is correct as the list is sorted.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False`, which is also correct since the last two elements are out of order.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False` correctly, as 15 is greater than 14, indicating unsorted order.

The function handles all edge cases for non-decreasing order and does not miss any potential cases. Thus, the implementation is correct.
