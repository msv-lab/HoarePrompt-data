Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` uses the `all()` function combined with a generator expression to compare each element in the list with the next one. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:
- The expression `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]` checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element.
- The `range(len(lst) - 1)` ensures that the comparisons are made only between valid indices of the list.
- If all comparisons return `True`, the `all()` function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function handles various edge cases:
1. An empty list is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
2. A list with a single element is also considered sorted, which the function correctly identifies.
3. For a list with multiple elements, it accurately checks the ordering.

Since the function correctly handles these scenarios and adheres to the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
