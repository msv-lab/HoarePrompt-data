According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst`. The loop will execute if `len(lst) - 1` is at least 1, which means that `len(lst)` must be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will have the value of `len(lst) - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least 2 comparable elements, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`lst is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, i is 0`**
