Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression with `all()` to iterate through the list and compares adjacent elements to ensure that each element is less than or equal to the next one. 

The annotations clarify that the function will also return `True` for an empty list or a single-element list, as these can be considered sorted by definition. This aligns with the problem description, which does not specify any restrictions on the length of the list.

Since the code handles all potential cases outlined in the problem description correctly and returns the expected boolean values, I conclude that the correctness is indeed valid for all scenarios. The annotations support this understanding by confirming expected behavior for edge cases.

Thus, I find no examples where the code fails to meet the requirements, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
