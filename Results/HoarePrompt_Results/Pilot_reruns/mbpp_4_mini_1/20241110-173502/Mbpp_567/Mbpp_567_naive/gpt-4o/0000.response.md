Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding such a case, it returns `True`, meaning the list is sorted.

The assertions provided confirm that the function works correctly for the tested cases. Additionally, it handles edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with a single element, since they will correctly return `True` as they are considered sorted by default. Thus, there are no examples where the function fails to meet the problem description.
