The function returns `False`, and `lst` is a list with at least 1 element, while `i` has a value of 0. The return statement does not change the state of `lst` or `i`, so the output state is `lst` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and the function returns False**
