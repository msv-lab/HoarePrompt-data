According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. The expression `len(lst) - 1` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute, which means `len(lst)` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `lst` must have at least 1 element for the loop to run. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should begin at 0, which is the initial value for the loop index.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
