The function returns the result of the expression `all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))`. This expression checks if every element in the list `lst` is less than or equal to the next element. The state of `lst` is not affected by the return statement. Therefore, the output state is that `lst` remains a list of comparable elements, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order**.
