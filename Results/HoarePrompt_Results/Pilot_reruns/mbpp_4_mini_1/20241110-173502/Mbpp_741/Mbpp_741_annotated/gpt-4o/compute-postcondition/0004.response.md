The function returns `False`, and the variables `s` contains at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the first character of `s`. The return statement does not change the state of `s`, `first_char`, or `char`, so the output state is `s` contains at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`s` contains at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns False**
