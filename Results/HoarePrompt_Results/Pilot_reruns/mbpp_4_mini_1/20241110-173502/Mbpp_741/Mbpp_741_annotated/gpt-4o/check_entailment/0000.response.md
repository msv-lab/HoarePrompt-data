To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`, we need to analyze it against the problem description, which states that the function should check whether all characters in the given string `s` are the same.

1. **Checking for an empty string**: 
   - The function first checks if `s` is empty (`if (not s) : return True`). This is correct according to the problem description since an empty string can be considered as having all "same" characters (as there are none).

2. **Character comparison**:
   - The function captures `first_char` as the first character of the string and then enters a loop to compare each subsequent character to `first_char`. If any character does not match `first_char`, it returns `False`, indicating not all characters are the same. This part of the logic is also correct.

3. **Implicit return**: 
   - The issue arises with the part of the code where it does not explicitly return a value if all characters are the same. The function's structure means that if all characters match `first_char`, it will reach the final `return True` statement. However, the annotations state that if `s` contains multiple identical characters, the function could implicitly return `None` if it does not hit the return statement.

4. **Potential edge case**: 
   - The annotations indicate that if `s` contains multiple identical characters, the function may end up returning `None` instead of `True`. This contradicts the requirement that the function should return `True` when all characters are the same. 

Given these points, the function does not handle the edge case correctly where all characters are the same, as it might return `None`, which is not acceptable according to the problem description.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

The function fails to return a definitive output for the case of all same characters, which should be `True` but can be `None` instead.
