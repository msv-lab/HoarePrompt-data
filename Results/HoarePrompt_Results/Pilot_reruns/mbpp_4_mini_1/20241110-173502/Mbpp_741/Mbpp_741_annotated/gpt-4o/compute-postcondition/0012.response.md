According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains at least 3 characters, and `char` is the third character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next character in the string. Therefore, `char` must be updated to the fourth character of `s`. The variable `s` does not need to be adjusted, as it remains the same.

State: **`s` contains at least 3 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the fourth character of `s`.**
