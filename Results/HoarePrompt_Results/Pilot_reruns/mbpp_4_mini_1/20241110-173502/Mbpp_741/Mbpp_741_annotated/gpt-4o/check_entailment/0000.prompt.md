You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #State of the program after the return statement: `s` is a string, which can be empty or contain any characters, and the function returns True
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `s` is a string, which can be empty or contain any characters, and the function returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, which can be empty or contain any characters. If `s` is empty, the function returns True. If `s` contains any characters, the function does not return a value.
    first_char = s[0]
    #State of the program here: If `s` is empty, the function returns True; if `s` contains characters, `first_char` is assigned to the first character of `s, and the function does not return a value.
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `s` is empty, the function returns True and no iteration occurs. If `s` contains at least one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`. After the loop executes, if all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returning None). If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. Therefore, if `s` contains only one unique character, the function will complete the loop without returning, and if `s` contains different characters, it will return False at the first mismatch.
    return True
    #State of the program after the return statement: The function completes execution and returns True, indicating that all characters in `s` are the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is empty or if all characters in `s` are the same. It returns `False` if any character in `s` differs from the first character. If `s` contains multiple characters that are the same, the function implicitly returns `None` after completing the loop without any mismatch. Therefore, the function can also yield `None` as a possible outcome if `s` has multiple identical characters but is not empty.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
