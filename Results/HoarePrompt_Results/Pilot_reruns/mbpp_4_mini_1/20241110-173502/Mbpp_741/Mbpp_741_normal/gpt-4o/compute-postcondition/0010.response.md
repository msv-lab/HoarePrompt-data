The function returns `False`, and the variable `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, and `char` is the third character of `s`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, and the function returns False**
