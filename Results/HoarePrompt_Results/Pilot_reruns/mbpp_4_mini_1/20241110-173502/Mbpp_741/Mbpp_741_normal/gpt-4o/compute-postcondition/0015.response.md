The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string that can be empty or contain any characters. After executing the function body, if `s` is empty, the function returns `True`. If `s` contains characters, the function checks if all characters are equal to the first character; if so, it implicitly returns `None`. If any character differs from the first character, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `True` if `s` is empty, `False` if `s` contains characters that are not all the same as the first character, and implicitly return `None` if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, returns `True` if `s` is empty; returns `False` if `s` contains characters that are not all the same as the first character; implicitly returns `None` if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character.**
