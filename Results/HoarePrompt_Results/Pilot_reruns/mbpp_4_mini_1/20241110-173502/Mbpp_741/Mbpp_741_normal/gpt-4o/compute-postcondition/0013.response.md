Output State: **If `s` is an empty string, the function returns True, and no loop execution occurs. If `s` contains characters, then after the loop executes, if all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`, the function implicitly returns None. If any character differs from `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. Hence, if the loop executes, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` will be equal to or differ from `first_char` based on the characters in `s`.**
