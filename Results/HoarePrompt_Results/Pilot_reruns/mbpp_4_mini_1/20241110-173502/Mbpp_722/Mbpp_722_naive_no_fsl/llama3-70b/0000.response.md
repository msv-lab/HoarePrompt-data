Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly filters students based on their height and weight in accordance with the problem description. It takes a dictionary of student data, which includes the student's name as a key and a tuple of their height and weight as the value. The function returns a new dictionary that includes only those students whose height and weight are both greater than or equal to the specified minimum values.

The comprehension used in the function checks each student's height and weight against the provided minimums, ensuring that none of the students who do not meet the criteria are included in the output. 

For example:
- Input: `func_1({'Alice': (160.0, 55.0), 'Bob': (150.0, 45.0)}, 155.0, 50.0)` would output `{'Alice': (160.0, 55.0)}`, correctly including only Alice who meets both criteria.
- Input: `func_1({}, 155.0, 50.0)` would correctly return an empty dictionary as there are no students to filter.

Since the function handles various scenarios, including empty input and multiple students with varying heights and weights, it meets the problem requirements comprehensively. Thus, I find no potential cases where the program would not work as described.
