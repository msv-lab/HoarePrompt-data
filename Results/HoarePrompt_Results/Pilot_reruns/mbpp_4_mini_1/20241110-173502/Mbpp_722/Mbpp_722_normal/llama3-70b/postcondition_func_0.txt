The function accepts a dictionary `student_data` where each key is a student's name and the value is a tuple containing their height and weight. It also accepts two float parameters, `min_height` and `min_weight`. The function returns a new dictionary containing only the entries from `student_data` for students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet these criteria, the function returns an empty dictionary.
