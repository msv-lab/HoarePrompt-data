Functionality: ** The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` containing student names as keys and tuples of (height, weight) as values, along with float values `min_height` and `min_weight`. It returns a filtered dictionary of students where each student meets or exceeds the specified minimum height and weight requirements. If no students meet the criteria, it will return an empty dictionary.**
