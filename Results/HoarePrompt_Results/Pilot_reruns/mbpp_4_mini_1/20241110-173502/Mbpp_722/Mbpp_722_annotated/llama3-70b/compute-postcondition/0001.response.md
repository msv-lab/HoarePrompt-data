The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_data` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names, and values are tuples of two floats representing the student's height and weight. The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats that represent the minimum height and weight criteria, respectively. After executing the function body, the function returns a new dictionary containing only those students who meet or exceed the specified minimum height and weight criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student data and two float values representing minimum height and weight, returning a new dictionary of students who meet or exceed these minimum criteria.**
