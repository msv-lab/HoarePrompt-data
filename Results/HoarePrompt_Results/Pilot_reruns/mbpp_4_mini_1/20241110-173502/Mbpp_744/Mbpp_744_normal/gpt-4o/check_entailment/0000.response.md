The given problem description states that the function should check if the given tuple has any None value, returning True if at least one None is found and False otherwise. If the tuple is empty, it should also return False.

Looking at the provided code:

```python
def func_1(tup):
    for item in tup:
        if item is None:
            return True
    return False
```

The code iterates over each item in the tuple and returns True as soon as it encounters a None value. If it goes through the entire tuple without finding a None, it returns False. 

Now, considering edge cases:
1. If the tuple is empty, the loop will not run, and the function will reach the `return False` statement correctly.
2. The function would return True for tuples that contain at least one None, which is the expected behavior.

The output hints state that the function checks for None values in the tuple and returns the correct boolean values based on the presence or absence of None. It also mentions that it will return False for an empty tuple, which is consistent with the logic in the code.

Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement and also aligns with the output hints without any discrepancies or missing edge cases, we can conclude that the function is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly identifies tuples containing None values and handles empty tuples appropriately, returning the expected boolean results in all cases.
