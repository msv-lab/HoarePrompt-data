Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if any element in the given tuple `tup` is `None`. It utilizes the built-in `any()` function combined with a generator expression to evaluate whether there exists at least one `None` value in the tuple. 

The annotations state that the function accepts a tuple containing any type of elements, including `None`, and confirms that it returns a boolean indicating the presence of `None`. Furthermore, the annotations clarify that the function handles empty tuples appropriately by returning `False`, which aligns with the expected behavior since an empty tuple contains no elements, and thus, no `None` values.

All potential cases are covered by the code:
- For a tuple containing one or more `None` values, the function will return `True`.
- For a tuple without any `None` values, it will return `False`.
- For an empty tuple, it will also return `False`.

Since the code meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every possible scenario without failing, I believe the code is correct.
