The function returns `True`, and `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, meaning `item` is the second element in `tup`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `tup`, and the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `tup`, and the function returns True**
