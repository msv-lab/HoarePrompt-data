Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in `tup`. If `item` is None, the function returns True. There is no else part in the code, so the behavior for cases where `item` is not None is not defined, and the function may continue executing or return an unspecified value.***
