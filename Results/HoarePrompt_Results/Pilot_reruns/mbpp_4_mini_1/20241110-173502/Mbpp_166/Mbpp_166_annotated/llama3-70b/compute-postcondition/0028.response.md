Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity that can be formed with the element at index `len(nums) - 2`, where `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. If the element at index `i` and the element at index `j` have the same parity (i.e., their bitwise XOR is even), then `count` is increased by 1. If the parity is different, `count` remains unchanged.***
