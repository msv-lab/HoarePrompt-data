The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity. The states of `i` and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is updated by 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `len(nums)`.

Output State: **`count` is updated by 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `len(nums)`**
