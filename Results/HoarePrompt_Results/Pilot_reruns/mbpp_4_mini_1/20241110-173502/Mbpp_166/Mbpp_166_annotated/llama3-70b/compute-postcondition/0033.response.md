The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `len(nums) - 1`.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `len(nums) - 1**
