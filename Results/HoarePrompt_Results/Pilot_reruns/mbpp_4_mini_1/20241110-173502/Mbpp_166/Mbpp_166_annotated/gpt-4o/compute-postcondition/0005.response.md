The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function calculates the count of even integers (`even_count`) and the count of odd integers (`odd_count`) in the list. It then computes `even_pairs` as the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `even_count`, and `odd_pairs` as the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from `odd_count`. Finally, the function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers and return the total number of pairs of even and odd integers that can be formed from that list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers that can be formed from the list.**
