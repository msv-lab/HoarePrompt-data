To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the function's logic and the requirement that it counts pairs of integers in a list whose XOR results in an even number.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Understanding XOR and Evenness**: 
   - The XOR of two integers `a` and `b` is even if both integers have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).
   - Hence, for the XOR of two numbers to be even, we can conclude that either:
     - Both numbers are even, or
     - Both numbers are odd.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function `func_1(nums)` iterates through all pairs of integers in the list `nums`:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

- The outer loop runs through each element in the list.
- The inner loop compares the current element with all subsequent elements.
- The condition checks if the result of the XOR operation is even.

### Potential Issues:
- The code does correctly identify pairs of numbers whose XOR is even, but it does so inefficiently. The condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0` could be simplified to check the parity directly as described above.
- However, the logic still holds true because if both numbers have the same parity, the XOR will indeed yield an even result.

### Test Cases:
To ensure correctness, let's consider some test cases:

1. **Input with all even numbers**:
   - Input: `[2, 4, 6]`
   - All pairs `(2, 4)`, `(2, 6)`, and `(4, 6)` are valid. Expected output: `3`.

2. **Input with all odd numbers**:
   - Input: `[1, 3, 5]`
   - All pairs `(1, 3)`, `(1, 5)`, and `(3, 5)` are valid. Expected output: `3`.

3. **Input with mixed even and odd numbers**:
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Valid pairs: `(1, 3)` and `(2, 4)`. Expected output: `2`.

4. **Input with no pairs**:
   - Input: `[]` (empty list)
   - Expected output: `0`.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to handle all these cases correctly, processing the list and counting all pairs of integers that yield an even XOR result. The logic is sound, even if it could be optimized further.

Since I cannot find a single case where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that yield an even XOR.
