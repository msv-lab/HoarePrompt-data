The code calculates `odd_pairs` as `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `odd_count` is not specified in the initial state, but it holds the count of odd integers in `lst`. The calculation for `odd_pairs` depends on the value of `odd_count`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `odd_pairs` is determined based on the value of `odd_count`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`; `odd_pairs` is calculated as `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`**
