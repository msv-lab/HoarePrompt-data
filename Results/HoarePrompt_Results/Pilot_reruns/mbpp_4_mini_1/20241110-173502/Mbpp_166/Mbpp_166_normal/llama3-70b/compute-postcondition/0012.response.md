Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd, `i` remains 0, `j` is the number of iterations that have occurred (from 1 to len(nums) - 1), and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. If `nums` contains only one element, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `nums` contains at least 2 elements, the loop executes for `len(nums) - 1` iterations, checking pairs of elements starting from index 0.**
