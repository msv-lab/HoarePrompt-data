Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(nums)` is greater than 2. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even (indicating that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are either even or odd), then `count` is incremented by 1. If the XOR is odd, `count` remains unchanged.***
