The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`nums`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
