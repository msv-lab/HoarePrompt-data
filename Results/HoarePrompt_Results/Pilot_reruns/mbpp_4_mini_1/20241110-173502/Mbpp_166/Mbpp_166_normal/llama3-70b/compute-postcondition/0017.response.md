According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, which means the next iteration will set `j` to 3. We need to ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute again. Since it is given that `len(nums)` is greater than 2, we can adjust it to specify that `len(nums)` must be greater than 3 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted for `j` to be 3.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and `len(nums)` is greater than 3.**
