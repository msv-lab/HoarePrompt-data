Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `len(nums)` is greater than 4. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is incremented by 1. If the bitwise XOR is odd, `count` remains unchanged.***
