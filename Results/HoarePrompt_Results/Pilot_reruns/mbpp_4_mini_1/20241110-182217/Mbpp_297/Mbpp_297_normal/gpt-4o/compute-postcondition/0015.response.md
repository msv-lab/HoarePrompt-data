The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` and any elements from nested lists processed by `func_1`. If `nested_list` is empty, the value of `flat_list` remains empty. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the contents of `flat_list` before the return statement. 

If `flat_list` is empty, it indicates that no elements were processed. If `flat_list` contains elements, those elements will be reflected in the output.

Output State: **`flat_list` is the result of processing `nested_list`, which may be empty or contain elements based on the input**.
