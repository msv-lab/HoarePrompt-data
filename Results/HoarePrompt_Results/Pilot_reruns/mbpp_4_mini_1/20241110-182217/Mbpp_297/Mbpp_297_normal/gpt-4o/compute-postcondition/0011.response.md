The code appends `item`, which is the third element of `nested_list`, to `flat_list`. The state of `nested_list` is not directly affected, but `flat_list` will now contain an additional element, specifically the value of `item`. Since `flat_list` was not mentioned in the initial state, we will note that it has been updated to include `item`. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been updated to include `item`.**
