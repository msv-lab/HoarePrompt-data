The function `func_1(item)` is called with `item` as the second item in the `nested_list`. The result of this function call is then extended to `flat_list`. The previous state of `flat_list` is not provided, so we cannot specify its initial contents. However, the state of `nested_list` is known to contain at least two items.

The output state will reflect the current state of `nested_list`, the second item in that list as `item`, and indicate that `flat_list` has been extended with the result of `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list, and `flat_list` has been extended with the result of `func_1(item)`**
