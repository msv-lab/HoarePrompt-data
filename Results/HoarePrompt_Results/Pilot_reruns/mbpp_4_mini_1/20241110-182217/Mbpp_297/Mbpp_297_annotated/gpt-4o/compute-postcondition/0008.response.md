Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items. If the second item in the list (item) is itself a list, then `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. If the second item is not a list, then `flat_list` includes this item. Thus, `flat_list` either contains the flattened contents of `item` if it is a list or the second item directly if it is not.***
