The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` calls the function `func_1` with `item` as the argument and extends `flat_list` with the result of that function. 

Since `nested_list` is a list with at least one item, `item` is assigned the value of the first item in `nested_list`. The previous state of `flat_list` is that it is empty. After the execution of the code, `flat_list` will contain the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. However, the specific contents of `flat_list` cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `func_1`.

Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`**
