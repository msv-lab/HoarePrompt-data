The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(element))` takes the second element of the list `nested_list` and passes it to the function `func_1`, which presumably returns a list or iterable. The `extend` method then adds each element returned by `func_1(element)` to the `flat_list`. The original values of `flat_list` and the output of `func_1(element)` will determine the final state.

Since `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, and `element` is assigned to be the second element of `nested_list`, we can summarize the impact as follows:

- `element` is the second element of `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`.

The previous values of `flat_list` are unknown because they are not specified in the initial state. However, we know that `func_1(element)` will return some value that will be added to `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`**.
