The `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(element)`, where `element` is the first element in `nested_list`. The value of `flat_list` will change as it will now include whatever is returned by `func_1(element)`. The previous value of `flat_list` is an empty list, and `nested_list` has at least one element. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is the result of extending the empty list with `func_1(element)`, and `element` is the first element in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is the result of extending the empty list with `func_1(element)`, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`**
