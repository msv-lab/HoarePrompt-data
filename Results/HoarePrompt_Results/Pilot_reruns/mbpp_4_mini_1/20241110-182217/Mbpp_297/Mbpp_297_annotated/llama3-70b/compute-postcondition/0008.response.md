Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element of `nested_list`. If `element` is a list, then `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` has `element` appended to it. This covers the case where `element` is either a list or a non-list type, ensuring that `flat_list` reflects the appropriate transformation based on the type of `element`.***
