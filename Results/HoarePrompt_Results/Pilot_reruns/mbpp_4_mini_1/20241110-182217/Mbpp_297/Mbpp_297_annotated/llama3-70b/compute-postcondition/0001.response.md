According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `flat_list` is empty, and `element` should represent the first element in `nested_list`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `nested_list` must have at least one element, and `element` should be the first element of `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`**
