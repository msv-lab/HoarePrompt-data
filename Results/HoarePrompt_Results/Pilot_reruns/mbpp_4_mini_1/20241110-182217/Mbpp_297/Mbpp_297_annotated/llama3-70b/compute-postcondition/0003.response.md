The value of `element` is appended to `flat_list`. Since `flat_list` is initially empty and `element` is the first element of `nested_list`, after execution, `flat_list` will contain that first element. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`, and `element` is the first element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`, `element` is the first element of `nested_list`**
