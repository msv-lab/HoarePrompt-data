Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly flattens a nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle lists within lists and appends non-list elements directly to the `flat_list`. The program will work for various cases, including:

1. An empty list: `func_1([])` will return `[]`.
2. A flat list: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` will return `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. A nested list: `func_1([1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]])` will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

All potential edge cases that may arise with different types of nested structures are handled correctly, as the function can recursively process deeply nested lists. Therefore, the function meets the problem description requirements and should be considered correct.
