The function returns `s.replace(' ', '%20')`, which replaces all spaces in the string `s` with `%20`. The initial state indicates that `s` is a string that may contain spaces, but the specific content of `s` is not provided. Therefore, the return statement will yield a modified version of `s` where every space is replaced by `%20`. The return statement does not change the state of the variable `s`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string that may contain spaces, and the function returns the modified string with spaces replaced by '%20'**
