The function returns `s.replace(' ', '%20')`, which replaces all spaces in the string `s` with `%20`. The value of `s` is a string that may contain spaces, and the return statement does not change the state of `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the original value of `s` and indicates that the function returns a modified version of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string that may contain spaces, and the function returns `s` with spaces replaced by `%20`**
