Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The use of `s.replace(' ', '%20')` effectively handles all potential cases, including:

1. A string with multiple spaces.
2. A string with leading and trailing spaces.
3. A string with no spaces at all.
4. A string that consists solely of spaces.

In each of these scenarios, the program will return the expected output according to the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
