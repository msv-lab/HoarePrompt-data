Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the requirement to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The use of the `replace` method ensures that every space character in the input string is replaced appropriately. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works for various test cases:

1. For the input `'My Name is Dawood'`, it correctly returns `'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'`.
2. For the input `'I am a Programmer'`, it returns `'I%20am%20a%20Programmer'`.
3. For the input `'I love Coding'`, it outputs `'I%20love%20Coding'`.

Since I cannot identify any edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet its requirement, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
