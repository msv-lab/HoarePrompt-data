To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem description:** Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup):
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            return tup.index(elem)
    return len(tup)
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Logic:** 
   - The function iterates through each element in the tuple `tup`.
   - It checks if the current element (`elem`) is a tuple.
   - If it finds an element that is a tuple, it returns the index of that tuple in `tup`.
   - If no tuple is found, it returns the length of the tuple.

### Potential Cases:

1. **Case with no tuple:** 
   - If `tup = (1, 2, 3)`, the function will return `3`, which is the length of the tuple. This case seems correct as there are no tuples to count before.

2. **Case with a single tuple:**
   - If `tup = (1, 2, (3, 4))`, the function will return `2`, which is also correct because there are two elements before the tuple `(3, 4)`.

3. **Multiple tuples:**
   - If `tup = (1, (2, 3), (4, 5))`, here the function will return `1` because it stops at the first tuple it encounters, which is at index `1`.

4. **Case where a tuple occurs before another tuple:**
   - If `tup = ((1, 2), (3, 4), 5)`, the program will return `0` since it finds the first element that is a tuple at index `0`. This is correct as there are no elements before the first tuple.

5. **Empty Tuple:**
   - If `tup = ()`, the function would go to the return statement and return `0` since the length of the tuple is `0`. This case is also logically correct.

### Conclusion:
The function does not cover a critical aspect of the description, which is to find the number of elements that occur before the first tuple element and return that count, not the index of the tuple. The function prematurely returns the index of the first found tuple instead of counting the preceding elements correctly.

**Example where it does not work correctly:**
- For `tup = (1, (2, 3), 5)`, it returns `1`, but it should return `1` as there is one element before the first tuple (which is `1`).

Given the above analysis, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
