The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is the third element of `tup`, its index is 2 (as indexing starts from 0). The return statement does not change the state of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple containing at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`, and the function returns 2.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`, and the function returns 2**
