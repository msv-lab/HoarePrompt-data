The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple containing elements, where at least one element can be a tuple. If `tup` contains at least one element that is a tuple, the function returns the index of the first tuple found in `tup`. If `tup` contains no tuples or is an empty tuple, the function does not execute the loop and there is no return value. Additionally, if `tup` is not empty and contains no tuples, the function returns the length of `tup`, which is based on the number of elements in `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the index of the first tuple found, or return the length of `tup` if there are no tuples present, while handling cases where `tup` is empty or has no tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, returns the index of the first tuple found in tup if there is at least one tuple; if tup contains no tuples, it returns the length of tup if it is not empty; if tup is empty or contains no tuples, there is no return value.**
