The function returns `tup.index(elem)`, which finds the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is defined as the first element of `tup`, the index returned will be `0`. The return statement does not change the state of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple containing at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element of `tup`, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element of `tup`, and the function returns 0**
