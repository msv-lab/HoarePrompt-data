The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The variable `elem` is the second element of `tup`, so its index in `tup` is 1 (since indexing starts at 0). The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `tup` is a tuple containing at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`, and the function returns 1.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`, and the function returns 1**
