The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `tup` is a tuple containing at least 4 elements, `elem` is the third element in `tup`, `count` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
