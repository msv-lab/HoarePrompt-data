Output State: **`count` is equal to the number of non-tuple elements in `tup` before the first tuple element, `elem` is the first element in `tup` that was checked, and `tup` is a tuple containing at least one element. If the first element in `tup` is a tuple, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If all elements in `tup` are non-tuple, then `count` will equal the total number of elements in `tup`.**
