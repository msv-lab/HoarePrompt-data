The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that may contain elements of any type and contains at least one element. The function counts the number of non-tuple elements in `tup` before the first tuple element is encountered. The function then returns this count. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the count of non-tuple elements that appear before the first tuple element within `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup (a tuple with at least one element) and returns the count of non-tuple elements before the first tuple element.**
