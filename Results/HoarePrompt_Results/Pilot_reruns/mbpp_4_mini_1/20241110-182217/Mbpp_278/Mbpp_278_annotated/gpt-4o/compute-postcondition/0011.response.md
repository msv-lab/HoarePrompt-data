Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least 4 elements, `count` is 4, and `elem` is the fourth element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `elem` is not a tuple, no action is taken, and the program continues executing the subsequent code.***
