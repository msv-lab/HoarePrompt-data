To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze the function and its behavior with potential inputs.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the number of elements that occur before the first tuple element in a given tuple.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(tup):
    count = 0
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            break
        count += 1
    return count

assert func_1((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == 3
assert func_1((2, 9, (5, 7), 11)) == 2
assert func_1((11, 15, 5, 8, (2, 3), 8)) == 4
```

### Analysis:
1. The function initializes a `count` variable to zero.
2. It iterates over each element in the tuple:
   - If the element is a tuple, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the element is not a tuple, it increments the `count`.
3. The function returns the count of elements that occurred before the first tuple element.

### Test Cases:
1. `func_1((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10))` should return `3`, which is correct as there are three elements before the tuple `(4, 6)`.
2. `func_1((2, 9, (5, 7), 11))` should return `2`, which is also correct as there are two elements before the tuple `(5, 7)`.
3. `func_1((11, 15, 5, 8, (2, 3), 8))` should return `4`, which is correct since there are four elements before the tuple `(2, 3)`.

### Additional Cases:
- What if the tuple starts with a tuple? For example, `func_1(((4, 6), 1, 5, 7, 10))` should return `0`, as there are no elements before the first tuple.
- If the tuple is empty, `func_1(())` should return `0`, as there are no elements at all.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle cases where the tuple starts with a tuple or is empty. For instance:
- `func_1(((4, 6), 1, 5, 7, 10))` returns `0`, which is correct.
- `func_1(())` returns `0`, which is also correct.

However, the function works correctly for the provided assertions and additional edge cases considered. Thus, I cannot find a situation where the function fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
