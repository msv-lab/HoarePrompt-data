Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns the sorted difference between the two lists. The use of `set(list1) ^ set(list2)` correctly computes the symmetric difference, which is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. This means it effectively identifies elements that are unique to each list.

The sorted function is then applied to return a sorted list of these unique elements. The implementation handles various cases, including:
- Both lists being empty (returns an empty list).
- One list being empty and the other having elements (returns the elements of the non-empty list).
- Identical lists (returns an empty list).
- Lists with overlapping elements (returns only the unique elements).

Since the function correctly computes the difference for all potential cases, it meets the problem description requirements.
