To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break it down step by step.

**Problem description:** The task is to write a function that gets the difference between two lists. 

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return sorted(list(set(list1) ^ set(list2)))
```

### Initial Assessment

The code uses the symmetric difference operator `^` with sets to find elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. This means that it correctly identifies the difference between the two lists. The result is then sorted before being returned. 

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty lists:** If both lists are empty, the function should return an empty list, which it does as `set()` will also be empty.
2. **Non-hashable elements:** The problem description doesn't specify that the lists can only contain hashable elements, but the code uses sets, which means any non-hashable elements will cause a `TypeError`. This is a potential edge case that the function does not handle.
3. **Identical lists:** If both lists are identical, the function should return an empty list, which it does as their symmetric difference will be empty.
4. **Lists with duplicates:** The function converts the lists to sets, so duplicates are inherently managed. 

### Output Hints

**Output hints:** The output hints correctly state that the function returns a sorted list of the symmetric difference between `list1` and `list2`, and it highlights the limitation regarding non-hashable elements. This implies that if the input lists contain any non-hashable items (like lists or dictionaries), it will raise a `TypeError`.

### Conclusion

The code works correctly for cases where the input lists contain hashable elements. However, it fails to handle cases with non-hashable elements, which would lead to a `TypeError`. Given that the problem description requires the function to handle all cases, including those with potential non-hashable elements, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases with non-hashable elements, which is a significant oversight given that the problem description does not restrict the input to only hashable elements.
