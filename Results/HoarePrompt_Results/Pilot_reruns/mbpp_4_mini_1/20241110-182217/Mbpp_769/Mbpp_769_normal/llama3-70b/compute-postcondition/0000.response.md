The code returns the sorted list of elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, which is the symmetric difference of the two sets created from the lists. The initial state indicates that `list1` and `list2` contain hashable elements, but their specific contents are unknown. The return value will be a sorted list of the unique elements from the symmetric difference.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists containing hashable elements, and the function returns a sorted list of the symmetric difference between `list1` and `list2`.**
