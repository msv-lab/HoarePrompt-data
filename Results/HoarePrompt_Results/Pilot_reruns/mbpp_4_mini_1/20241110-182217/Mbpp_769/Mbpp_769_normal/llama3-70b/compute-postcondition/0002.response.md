Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, containing hashable elements, and it returns a sorted list of the symmetric difference between the two lists. The symmetric difference includes elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The function does not handle the case where the lists may contain non-hashable elements, which would raise a TypeError. **
