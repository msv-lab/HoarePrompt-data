The code sorts `result_list` in place based on the index of its elements in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. The previous values of `list1`, `set1`, `set2`, `diff_elements`, and `result_list` are not altered by this sorting operation. The sorting will rearrange the elements of `result_list` according to their order of first appearance in the concatenated `list1 + list2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the operation performed.

Output State: **`list1` is a list that can contain any type of elements; `set1` is a set derived from `list1`, containing unique elements; `set2` is a set derived from `list2`; `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`; `result_list` is sorted based on their index in the concatenated `list1 + list2`.**
