The code calculates the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference consists of elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. The values of `list1`, `set1`, and `set2` are not specified, but they can contain any type of elements. Therefore, the output state reflects that `diff_elements` is assigned the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list that can contain any type of elements; `set1` is a set derived from `list1`, containing unique elements; `set2` is a set derived from `list2`; `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`.**
