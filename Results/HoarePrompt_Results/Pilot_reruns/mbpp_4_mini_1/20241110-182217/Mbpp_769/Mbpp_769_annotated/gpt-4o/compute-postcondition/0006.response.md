The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements of any type. The function computes the unique elements of `list1` and `list2` by converting them into sets, resulting in `set1` and `set2`. It then calculates the symmetric difference between these two sets, resulting in `diff_elements`. Finally, the function returns `result_list`, which contains the elements representing the symmetric difference. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a list of unique elements that are present in either of the input lists but not in both. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a list of unique elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both.**
