The code converts the symmetric difference `diff_elements` between `set1` and `set2` into a list and assigns it to `result_list`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the presence of `result_list` containing the elements from the symmetric difference.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set containing the unique elements of `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the unique elements of `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, `result_list` is a list of elements from `diff_elements`.**
