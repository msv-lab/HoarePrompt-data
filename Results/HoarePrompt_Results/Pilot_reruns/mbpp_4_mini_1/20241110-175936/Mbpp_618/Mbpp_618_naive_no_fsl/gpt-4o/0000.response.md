Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the second list (`list2`) contains a zero. In such a situation, a division by zero would occur, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. For instance, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 0, 3])`, it would result in an error, as the second element in `list2` is zero, leading to a division by zero for the corresponding element in `list1`. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of safely dividing two lists element-wise in all cases.
