Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the elements of `list2` may contain zero. Dividing by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which means that for any list where `list2` contains a zero, the function will not work as expected. For example, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [1, 0, 3]`, the program will raise an error instead of returning a result. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
