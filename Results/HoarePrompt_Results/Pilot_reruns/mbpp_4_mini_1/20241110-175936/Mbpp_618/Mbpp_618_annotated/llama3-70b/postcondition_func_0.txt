The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and first checks if they are of the same length. If not, it raises a ValueError. If they are of the same length, it returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, a ZeroDivisionError will occur. Therefore, the function does not handle division by zero cases, which could lead to an error during execution.
