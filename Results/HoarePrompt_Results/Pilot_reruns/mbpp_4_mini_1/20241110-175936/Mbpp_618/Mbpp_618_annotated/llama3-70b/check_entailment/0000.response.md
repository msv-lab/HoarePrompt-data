Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. While it verifies that the two input lists, `list1` and `list2`, are of the same length and raises a `ValueError` if they are not, it fails to address the possibility of division by zero.

The annotations clearly state that if any element in `list2` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur, which means the function does not handle the case where an element in `list2` is zero. This situation poses a significant issue, as dividing by zero is undefined and will lead to an error during execution. 

For example, if `list1 = [10, 20, 30]` and `list2 = [1, 0, 3]`, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to compute `20 / 0`. This oversight means the program does not fulfill the requirement of safely dividing two lists element-wise, particularly under conditions where `list2` contains zero.

Therefore, since the code does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case, the final conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
