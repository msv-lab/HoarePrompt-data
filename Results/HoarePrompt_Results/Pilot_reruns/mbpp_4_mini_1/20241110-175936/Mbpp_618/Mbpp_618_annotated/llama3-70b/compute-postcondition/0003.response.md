The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, and they must have the same length. After executing the function body, it returns a list of the results of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers of the same length and return a new list containing the results of the element-wise division of the two lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, list1 and list2, both of the same length, and returns a list of results from dividing each element of list1 by the corresponding element of list2.**
