Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an element `elem`, iterates through the array, and checks if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`.

Here are the cases that validate the correctness of the program:

1. If `elem` is in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the correct index.
2. If `elem` is not in `arr`, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

The program handles edge cases, such as:
- An empty array, where it correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
- The element being the first or last in the array.
- The element appearing multiple times, where it returns the index of the first occurrence.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential input cases, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
