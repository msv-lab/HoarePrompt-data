The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the current value of `index`. The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list with at least one element, and `index` is 0, which corresponds to the first element of the list. The return statement does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `index` is 0, and the function returns (True, 0)**
