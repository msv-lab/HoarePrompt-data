Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It checks if the `element` is present in `arr` and returns a tuple (True, index) if found, where `index` is the index of the matching element. If the `element` is not found, it returns (False, -1). If `arr` is empty, the function also returns (False, -1) since it does not find any element. Therefore, the function always returns a tuple, regardless of the conditions. **
