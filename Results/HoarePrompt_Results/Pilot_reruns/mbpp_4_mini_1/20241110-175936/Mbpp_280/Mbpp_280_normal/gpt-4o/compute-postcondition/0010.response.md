Output State: **If `arr` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute for each element in `arr`, checking if `value` is equal to `element`. If a match is found, the function returns (True, index) where `index` is the index of the matching element. If no match is found after executing through all elements of `arr`, the function does not return any value. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and the function does not return any value.**
