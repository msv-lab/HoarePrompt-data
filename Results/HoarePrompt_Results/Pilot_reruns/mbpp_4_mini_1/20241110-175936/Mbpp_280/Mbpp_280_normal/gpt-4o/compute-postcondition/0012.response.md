The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. The parameter `arr` is a list of elements, which can be of any type. The parameter `element` is the value being searched for in the list. 

After executing the function body:
- If `arr` is a non-empty list, the function checks each element in `arr` for a match with `element`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple (True, index), where `index` is the position of the matching element in the list. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function does not return any value.
- If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value.
- If the function is called and no matching element is found (likely when `arr` is empty or when no matches occur in a non-empty list), it will return the tuple (False, -1).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and it will return a tuple (True, index) if the element is found in the list, (False, -1) if the element is not found, and it does not return any value if the list is empty or if no match is found after searching through the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`, returns (True, index) if `element` is found in `arr`, returns (False, -1) if `element` is not found, and does not return any value if `arr` is empty or if no match occurs in a non-empty list.**
