To assess the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it based on the problem description and the provided output hints.

**Problem description:** The task is to write a function that takes in an array and an element, returning a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(arr, elem):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == elem:
            return (True, i)
    return (False, -1)
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list `arr` and a value `elem`. It returns a tuple (True, i) if `elem` is found in `arr` at index `i`, or (False, -1) if `elem` is not found. If `arr` is empty, it also returns (False, -1) since the loop does not execute, which is not explicitly stated in the annotations.

### Initial Assessment
1. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checking if any element `x` matches `elem`.
2. If a match is found, it returns `(True, i)`, where `i` is the index of the matching element.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- If `arr` is an empty list, the function will immediately return `(False, -1)`, which aligns with the problem description.
- If `elem` is not present in `arr`, the function will also correctly return `(False, -1)`.
- If `elem` is present multiple times in `arr`, the function will return the index of the first occurrence, which is also correct.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints correctly summarize the behavior of the code:
- The function returns `(True, i)` when `elem` is found and `(False, -1)` when it is not found.
- The mention that it returns `(False, -1)` when `arr` is empty aligns with the behavior of the code.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement and matches the output hints provided. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code deviates from the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
