Output State: **If `arr` is a list with at least one element, the loop will either return (True, i) when it finds `elem` at index `i`, or it will continue checking the remaining elements without returning. If `elem` is not found, the loop completes without a return value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns no value.**
