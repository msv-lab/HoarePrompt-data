The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the value of `i`, which is 2. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `arr`, and the function returns `(True, 2)`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `arr`, and the function returns (True, 2)**
