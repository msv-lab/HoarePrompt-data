The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `elem`. The parameter `arr` is a list of elements, and `elem` can be any value that may or may not be present in `arr`. 

- Case 1: If `arr` is a non-empty list, the function will return a tuple (True, i) when it finds `elem` at index `i`. If `elem` is not found after checking all elements in `arr`, the function will complete without returning a value.
  
- Case 2: If `arr` is empty, the function will also complete without returning a value. 

- Additionally, if `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function will return (False, -1).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and a value `elem`, and return whether `elem` is found in `arr`, providing its index if found, or indicating that it was not found in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and a value `elem`, returns a tuple (True, i) if `elem` is found at index `i` in `arr`, returns (False, -1) if `elem` is not found, and returns no value if `arr` is empty.**
