The function returns a tuple `(True, i)`, where `i` is 0. The initial state shows that `arr` is a list with at least one element, and `i` is 0. The return statement does not change the state of `arr` or `i`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `arr` is a list of elements, `i` is 0, and the function returns `(True, 0)`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `i` is 0, and the function returns (True, 0)**
