Output State: **If `arr` is a list with at least one element and `elem` is equal to one of the elements in `arr`, the loop will return `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `arr` is a list with no elements, the loop does not execute, and there is no return value. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the loop executes until the end of the list without returning any value, leaving the state unchanged. In the case of an empty list, `arr` is empty, and the state remains unchanged.**
