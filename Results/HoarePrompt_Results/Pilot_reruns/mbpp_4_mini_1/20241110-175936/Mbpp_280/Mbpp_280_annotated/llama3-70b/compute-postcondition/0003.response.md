According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr` and the current index `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, meaning we are currently at the first element of `arr`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. 

Since `arr` has at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `x` needs to be updated to the second element of `arr`. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `x` should be the second element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `arr`**
