The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the value of `index`, which is 2. The return statement does not change the state of `arr`, and `index` remains 2. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least three elements, `index` is 2, and the function returns `(True, 2)`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least three elements, `index` is 2, and the function returns (True, 2)**
