The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. The parameter `arr` is a list of elements, and `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements in `arr`. 

- Case 1: If `arr` is a non-empty list, the function will return a tuple (True, index) where `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function will finish executing without returning a value. If `arr` is empty, the function does not execute the loop and also does not return a value. 
- Case 2: If `arr` is empty, the function will return the tuple (False, -1).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and a comparable `element`, and return a tuple indicating whether the element was found in the list and its index, or indicate that the list is empty. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and a value `element`, returns (True, index) if `element` is found in `arr`, returns (False, -1) if `arr` is empty. If `element` is not found in a non-empty `arr`, no value is returned.**
