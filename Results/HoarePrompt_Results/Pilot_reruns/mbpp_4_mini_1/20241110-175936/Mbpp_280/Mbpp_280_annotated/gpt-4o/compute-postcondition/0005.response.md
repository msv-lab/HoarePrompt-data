Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least one element, `index` is 1, and `value` is the second element in `arr`. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns (True, 1). If `value` is not equal to `element`, the function does not return any value (or implicitly returns None).***
