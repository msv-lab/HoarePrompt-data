To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and code annotations, let's analyze them step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function should:
1. Take in an array (`arr`) and an element (`element`).
2. Return a tuple containing:
   - A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
   - The index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

### Annotated Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` is defined to iterate over the array using `enumerate`, which gives both the index and value of each element in the array. It checks if the value matches the element:
- If a match is found, it returns `(True, index)`.
- If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.
- If the array is empty, the loop does not execute, and it directly returns `(False, -1)`.

### Code Behavior:
1. **Element Found**: The function returns `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `element`. This part aligns with the problem description.
2. **Element Not Found**: The function returns `(False, -1)` when the element is not found, which also aligns with the problem description.
3. **Empty Array**: The function handles an empty array correctly by returning `(False, -1)`.

### Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles the case of an empty array.
- It also correctly returns the index of the first occurrence when duplicates are present.

### Conclusion:
The annotations state that there is no case where the function executes without returning a value, which is confirmed by the logic of the code. The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Thus, based on the thorough analysis of the problem description, the code behavior, and the annotations provided, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly handles all specified cases in the problem description and ensures that a return value is always given.
