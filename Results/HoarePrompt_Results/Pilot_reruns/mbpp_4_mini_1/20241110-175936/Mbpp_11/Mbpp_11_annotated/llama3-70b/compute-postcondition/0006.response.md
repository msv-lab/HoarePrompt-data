Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. It removes the first and last occurrences of `c` from `s` if `c` is present in `s`. If `c` is not found in `s`, it returns the original string unchanged. Additionally, if `c` occurs only once, the function will return the string with that single occurrence removed, effectively returning a string without that character. **
