The `first_occ` variable is assigned the value of `s.find(c)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is not present in `s`, it returns -1. The value of `first_occ` depends on the presence and position of `c` in `s`. Since the specific values of `s` and `c` are not provided, the output state reflects that `first_occ` is either an index (if `c` is found) or -1 (if `c` is not found).

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`, `first_occ` is either an index of `c` in `s` or -1**
