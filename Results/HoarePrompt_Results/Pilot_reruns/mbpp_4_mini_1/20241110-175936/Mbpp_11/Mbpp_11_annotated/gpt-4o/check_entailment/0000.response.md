To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations closely.

### Problem Description
The goal is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Code Analysis
Hereâ€™s the program with annotations:

```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    # first_index is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    # last_index is the last index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found

    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index):
        return s
    # The code returns `s` unchanged if `ch` is not present or appears only once.

    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    # This line is supposed to remove the first and last occurrences of `ch`.
```

### Logical Flow
1. **Finding Indices**: The program uses `find` and `rfind` to get the first and last indices of `ch` in `s`.
2. **Checks for Non-Occurrence or Single Occurrence**: If `ch` is not found (`first_index` or `last_index` is -1) or if both indices are the same (indicating only one occurrence), it returns the original string `s`.
3. **Removing Characters**: If there are multiple occurrences, it constructs a new string by concatenating parts of `s`, effectively removing the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`.

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **Empty String**: If `s` is empty, it should return an empty string regardless of `ch`.
2. **Character Not Present**: If `ch` is not in `s`, it should return `s`.
3. **Character Appears Once**: If `ch` appears only once, it should return `s` unchanged.
4. **Character Appears Multiple Times**: If `ch` appears multiple times, it should only remove the first and last occurrences.

### Potential Issue
The critical point in the code is the line that constructs the new string:
```python
return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```
This line works correctly for most cases but fails in the following situation:
- If `ch` is the first character and also the last character (e.g., `s = "aaa"` and `ch = "a"`). In this case, the `first_index` and `last_index` are `0` and `2`, respectively. The return value will be `s[:0] + s[1:2] + s[3:]`, which results in `"a"` instead of the expected empty string.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where the character to be removed is both the first and last character correctly. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**  
The code fails in the example where the string is `"aaa"` and the character is `"a"`, as it should return an empty string, but it returns `"a"` instead. The annotations indicate that the function returns `s` unchanged for certain cases, but it does not account for this specific scenario where both occurrences overlap.
