The function returns `s`, and the value of `s` is a string (as stated in the initial state). The return statement does not change the state of the other variables, `ch`, `first_index`, or `last_index`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1, and `last_index` is the last index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and the function returns `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1, `last_index` is the last index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and the function returns `s**
