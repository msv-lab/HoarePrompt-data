To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function and the requirements.

**Problem Description:** The function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function uses `s.find(ch)` to find the first occurrence of `ch` and `s.rfind(ch)` to find the last occurrence.
2. If `ch` is not found or if the first and last indices are the same (which means there's only one occurrence of `ch`), it returns the original string.
3. If both occurrences are found and are different, it constructs a new string that removes the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the string is empty, `func_1("", "a")` should return `""`, which it does.
- If the character to be removed does not exist in the string, for example, `func_1("hello", "x")`, it should return `"hello"`, which it does.
- If the character is found only once, for example, `func_1("hello", "h")`, it should return `"ello"`, which it does.
- If the first and last occurrence are the same, it should return the original string, e.g., `func_1("a", "a")`, which returns `"a"` as expected.
- If the character is at both ends, for instance, `func_1("aba", "a")`, it should return `"b"`.

**Critical Case:**
However, there's a critical issue with the way the program constructs the new string. For the case `func_1("hello", "l")`, it correctly identifies the first and last indices but fails to remove both 'l's correctly:

- The expected result is `"heo"` but the function returns `"heo"` due to the slicing logic being incorrect.

Another case is `func_1("aabbcc", "a")`. It should return `"bbcc"` but may not function correctly if the slicing logic does not account for this properly.

Given this analysis, we find that the program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically with the slicing logic.

Correctness: **False**.
