Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the character `c` appears multiple times in the string. Specifically, if the first and last occurrences of the character are the same (i.e., when the character appears only once in the string), the program will return the string without any modification. This is incorrect behavior according to the problem description, which requires removing both the first and last occurrences regardless of their positions.

For example, consider the input `func_1("abcda", "a")`. The expected output should be `bcd`, but the program would return `bcda` instead since it only removes the first occurrence of 'a' and leaves the last 'a' (which is at the same position).

Another example is `func_1("a", "a")`, where the expected output is an empty string, but the program will return the input string `""` since it doesn't effectively handle cases where there is only one occurrence of `c`.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements in the problem description.
