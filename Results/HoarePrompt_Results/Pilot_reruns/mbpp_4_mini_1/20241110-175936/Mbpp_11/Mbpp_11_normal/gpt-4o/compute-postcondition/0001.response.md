The variable `last_index` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(ch)`, which returns the highest index of the substring `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is found, `last_index` will be the index of its last occurrence; if not found, `last_index` will be -1. The values of the other variables `s`, `ch`, and `first_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential outcomes:

- If `ch` is found in `s`, `last_index` will be a non-negative integer (the index of the last occurrence).
- If `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` will be -1.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.**
