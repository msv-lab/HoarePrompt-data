The value of `first_index` is assigned the result of `s.find(ch)`, which returns the lowest index of the substring `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is found, `first_index` will hold the index of its first occurrence; if `ch` is not found, `first_index` will be `-1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, and `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, and `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found**
