The code assigns `last_occ` the value of `s.rfind(c)`, which finds the highest index of the substring `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is not found, it returns -1. The previous values of `s`, `c`, and `first_occ` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `last_occ` based on the presence of `c` in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string; `c` is a single character; `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found; `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found**
