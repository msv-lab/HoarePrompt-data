Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `c`. It removes the first and last occurrences of `c` from `s` if `c` is found in `s`. If `c` is not present in `s`, it returns `s` unchanged. If `c` appears only once in `s`, the function will return the string without that occurrence, effectively removing it entirely. **
