To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` does the following:
1. It finds the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` in the string `s`.
2. If either occurrence is not found (i.e., `first_index` or `last_index` is -1), or if the first and last occurrences are the same (which means the character appears only once), it returns the original string `s`.
3. If both occurrences are found and they are different, it constructs a new string by:
   - Taking the substring from the start of `s` to `first_index`
   - Skipping the character at `first_index`
   - Taking the substring from `first_index + 1` to `last_index`
   - Skipping the character at `last_index`
   - Taking the substring from `last_index + 1` to the end of `s`

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **Single Character String**: If `s` is 'a' and `ch` is 'a', the function should return an empty string, but it returns 'a' instead.
   - Example: `func_1('a', 'a')` should return `''` but returns `'a'`.
  
2. **Character Not Present**: If the character is not present in the string, it correctly returns the original string.
   - Example: `func_1('hello', 'x')` returns `'hello'`, which is correct.

3. **Character Appears Only Once**: If the character appears only once, it should also return the original string.
   - Example: `func_1('hello', 'h')` returns `'hello'`, which is correct.

4. **Character Appears Multiple Times**: The program appears to handle cases where the character appears multiple times correctly.
   - Example: `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function fails to handle the edge case where the input string consists of a single character that matches `ch`. Therefore, we have found a case where the program does not work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
