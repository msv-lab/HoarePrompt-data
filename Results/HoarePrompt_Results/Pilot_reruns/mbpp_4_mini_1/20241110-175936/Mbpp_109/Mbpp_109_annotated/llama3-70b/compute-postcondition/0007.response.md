The variable `temp` is a substring of `s` from index 1 to the end of `s`. The `count` variable is updated by adding the result of `temp.count('1') % 2`. This means that we first count the occurrences of '1' in `temp` and then take that count modulo 2. The previous value of `count` is updated based on this calculation. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the original binary string repeated; `n` is greater than 1; `count` is updated based on the count of '1's in `temp` modulo 2; `i` is 1; `temp` is the substring of `s` from index 1 to the end of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is the original binary string repeated; `n` is greater than 1; `count` is updated based on the count of '1's in `temp` modulo 2; `i` is 1; `temp` is the substring of `s` from index 1 to the end of `s.**
