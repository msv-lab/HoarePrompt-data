Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is the updated string after one left rotation, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, and `count` is 0 initially. If `integer_value` (the integer representation of `binary_str`) is odd, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If `integer_value` is even, `count` remains 0.***
