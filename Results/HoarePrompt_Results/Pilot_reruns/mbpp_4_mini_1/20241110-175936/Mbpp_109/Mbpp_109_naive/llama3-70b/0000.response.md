To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem statement and the program logic.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of binary strings that have an odd number of '1's when rotated a given number of times.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
    return count
```

### Analysis:
1. **String Rotation**: The function intends to rotate the binary string `s` `n` times. The approach used in the program is to extend the string `s` by repeating it enough times to accommodate `n` rotations. This means it creates a longer string from the original to simulate the rotations.

2. **Counting '1's**: For each rotation (from `0` to `n-1`), the program extracts a substring of length equal to `s` and counts the occurrences of '1'. It checks if this count is odd and increments `count` if it is.

### Potential Issues:
- **Rotation Logic**: The way the program constructs `s` (`s * (n // len(s) + 1)`) may lead to errors when `n` is less than the length of `s`. In such cases, `s` is effectively rotated in a non-standard manner since it doesn’t account for the actual rotation but rather extends the string.
  
  Example Case: 
  - If `s = "101"` and `n = 2`, the program constructs `s` as `"101101"`, which gives:
    - For `i = 0`: Substring = "101" → count of '1's = 2 (even)
    - For `i = 1`: Substring = "011" → count of '1's = 2 (even)
    - For `i = 2`: Substring = "110" → count of '1's = 2 (even)
    - Total count = 0 (as all are even).

  Now, if `n = 1`, we should only check the first rotation:
    - Only "101" → count of '1's = 2 (even).
    The expected behavior is not matching the actual handling of rotations.

3. **General Case**: The function does not correctly handle the case where `n` might be less than the length of `s`, which is a core aspect of the problem: it should accurately reflect the rotations of the string rather than just extending it.

Given this analysis, there exists at least one input case (when `n` is less than the length of `s`) where the program would not work correctly according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.
