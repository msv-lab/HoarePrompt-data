To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to find the number of odd values generated by rotating a binary string a given number of times.

**Code Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(binary_str, num_rotations):
    count = 0
    for _ in range(num_rotations):
        binary_str = binary_str[-1] + binary_str[:-1]
        integer_value = int(binary_str, 2)
        if integer_value % 2 == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
- The code correctly rotates the binary string to the right for the specified number of times.
- It converts the rotated string from binary to an integer and checks if the integer is odd.
- The count of odd integers is returned.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints state that the function counts how many times the integer value of the rotated string is odd after performing the rotations. It also mentions that if `num_rotations` is 0, the original string is evaluated only once.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. **Zero Rotations:** If `num_rotations` is 0, the function should evaluate the original binary string only once. The code does not handle this case explicitly, but it will still return the count based on the original string's value.
2. **Single Character Strings:** For a binary string of length 1 (e.g., '0' or '1'), the function will behave correctly for any number of rotations since rotating a single character does not change it.
3. **Strings with All Zeros:** If the input is '0000', the result should always be 0 since all rotations result in '0000', which is even.
4. **Strings with All Ones:** If the input is '1111', all rotations will yield '1111', which is odd. Here, every rotation will count as an odd value.

**Checking Consistency with Output Hints:**
The hints are consistent with the code. The function does count the odd occurrences after rotations, and the specified behaviors (like handling 0 rotations) align with how the code processes the input.

**Conclusion:**
The code correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement. It handles the cases mentioned and adheres to the logic laid out in the problem description and output hints. Therefore, I cannot find any situation where it fails to comply.

Correctness: **True**.
