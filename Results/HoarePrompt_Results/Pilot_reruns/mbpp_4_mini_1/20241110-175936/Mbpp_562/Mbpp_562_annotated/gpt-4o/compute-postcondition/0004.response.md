According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains more than one sublist, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, which means that the loop has already processed it. 

To allow the loop to execute again, there needs to be at least one more sublist in `list_of_lists` after the first sublist. Therefore, `list_of_lists` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it has at least two sublists. Since the current `sublist` is the first one, the next `sublist` to be processed will be the second sublist. 

State: **`max_length` is an integer representing the maximum length of sublists encountered, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least two sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
