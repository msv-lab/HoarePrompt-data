The value of `max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length is determined by the number of elements it contains. The other variables (`list_of_lists` and any previous value of `max_length`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_length` is the length of `sublist`, `list_of_lists` contains at least two sublists, and `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_length` is the length of `sublist`, `list_of_lists` contains at least two sublists, and `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`**
