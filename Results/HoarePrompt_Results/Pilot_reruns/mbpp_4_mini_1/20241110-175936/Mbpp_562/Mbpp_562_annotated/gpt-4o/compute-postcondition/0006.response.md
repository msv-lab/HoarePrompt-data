Postcondition: ***`max_length` is an integer representing the maximum length of sublists encountered, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least two sublists, and `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. If the length of `sublist` is less than or equal to `max_length`, then `max_length` remains unchanged.***
