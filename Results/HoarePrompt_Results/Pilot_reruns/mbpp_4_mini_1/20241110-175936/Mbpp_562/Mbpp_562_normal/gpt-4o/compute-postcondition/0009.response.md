Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least three sublists. If the length of the last sublist in `list_of_lists` exceeds `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of that sublist. If the length of the last sublist is less than or equal to `max_length`, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
