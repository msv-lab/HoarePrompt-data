Output State: **`max_length` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop does not execute and `max_length` remains 0. If `list_of_lists` contains sublists, `max_length` will be updated to the length of the longest sublist found during the loop execution.**
