Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input list `lists` is empty. In such a scenario, calling `max()` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, specifically when the input is an empty list. 

For example, if we call `func_1([])`, it will raise an exception instead of returning a valid length.
