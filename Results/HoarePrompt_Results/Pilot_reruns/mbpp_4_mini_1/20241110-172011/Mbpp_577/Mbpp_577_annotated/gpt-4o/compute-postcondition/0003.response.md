The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function computes the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the computed factorial. This includes returning 1 for `n` equal to 0 and the last digits of the factorial values for `n` from 1 to 4. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is 5 or greater, or the last digit of the factorial of `n` if `n` is less than 5.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than 5, it returns the last digit of the factorial of `n`.**
