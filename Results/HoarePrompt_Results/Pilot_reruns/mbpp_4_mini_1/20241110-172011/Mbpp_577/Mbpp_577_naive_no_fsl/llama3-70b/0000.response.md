Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the last digit of the factorial of a given number. Here are some cases where it fails:

1. For `n = 5`, the factorial is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`. However, the program will return `0`, which seems correct, but it only does so because of the general case for `n >= 4`.

2. For any `n >= 5`, the last digit of the factorial will always be `0` because the factorial will contain both `2` and `5` as factors, leading to a multiplication that includes `10`. The program, however, does not handle the case for `n = 5` and larger correctly since it doesn't explicitly account for them, only returning `0` without validating the logic.

3. For `n = 1` and `n = 0`, the factorial is `1`, and the last digit should be `1`, but the program correctly handles this case. However, there is no comprehensive logic that applies generally to other values.

Overall, the program does not correctly calculate the last digit of the factorial for all cases, especially for values greater than `4`, hence it is incorrect.
