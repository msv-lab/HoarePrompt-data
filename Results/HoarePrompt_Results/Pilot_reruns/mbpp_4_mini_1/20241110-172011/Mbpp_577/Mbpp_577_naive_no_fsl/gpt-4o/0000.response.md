To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding Factorial**: The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers up to `n`. The last digit of a factorial can be influenced by factors of 10, which arise from pairs of 2 and 5 in the multiplication.

2. **Handling Input**: 
   - The function checks if `n >= 5`. If true, it returns `0`, as any factorial of a number 5 or larger will end in a zero (due to at least one pair of 2 and 5 being present).
   - If `n < 5`, it calculates the factorial normally and returns the last digit.

3. **Output Verification**: The assertions in the code:
   - `func_1(4) == 4` is correct since `4! = 24`, and the last digit is `4`.
   - `func_1(21) == 0` is also correct, as `21!` ends with `0`.
   - `func_1(30) == 0` is correct for the same reason as above.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Negative Input**: The function does not handle negative inputs. The factorial is not defined for negative integers, which makes the function invalid for such cases. For example, `func_1(-1)` would not behave as expected.
- **Zero Input**: The factorial of `0` is defined as `1` (i.e., `0! = 1`), and therefore the last digit should be `1`. The function does not explicitly handle this case.

### Conclusion:
Since the function fails to handle negative numbers and does not return the correct last digit for the input `0`, it does not satisfy the problem description adequately.

Correctness: **False**
