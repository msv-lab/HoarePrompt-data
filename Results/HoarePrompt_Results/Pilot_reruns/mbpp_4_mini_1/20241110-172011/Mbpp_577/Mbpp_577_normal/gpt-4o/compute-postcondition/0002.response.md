Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n`, starting with `factorial` initialized to 1, and returns the last digit of that factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`). The function handles all values of `n` from 0 to 4, ensuring correct calculation of the factorial and its last digit.***
