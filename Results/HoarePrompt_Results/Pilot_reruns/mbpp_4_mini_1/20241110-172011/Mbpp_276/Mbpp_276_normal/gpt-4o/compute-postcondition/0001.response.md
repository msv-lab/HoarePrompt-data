The function returns `volume`, which is calculated as `math.pi * radius`. The previous value of `volume` is not explicitly given, but it is derived from `radius`. The return statement does not change the state of `radius` and `height`. Therefore, the output state is `radius` is a non-negative real number, `height` is a non-negative real number, and the function returns `volume`, calculated as `math.pi * radius`.

Output State: **`radius` is a non-negative real number, `height` is a non-negative real number, and the function returns `volume`, calculated as `math.pi * radius`**
