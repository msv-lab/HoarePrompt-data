To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should take in the radius and height of a cylinder and return the volume. The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \]

### Program:
```python
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

### Initial Assessment:
The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume based on the formula provided in the problem description. 

### Edge Cases:
1. **Zero Values**: If either the `radius` or `height` is 0, the volume should correctly be 0, as a cylinder with no height or radius has no volume.
2. **Negative Values**: The problem description does not specify how to handle negative values, but volume should not be negative. If the function receives negative values, it should ideally raise an error or return a value that indicates an invalid input.
3. **Non-Numeric Inputs**: The function does not handle cases where the inputs are not numbers, which could also lead to errors during execution.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts two non-negative numbers and returns the volume calculated as described. This aligns with the formula provided in the problem description.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints imply that the function should handle non-negative values only, but the code does not check for or enforce this condition. Thus, if a negative or non-numeric value is passed to the function, it may lead to unintended behavior or errors, which means it does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the program does not account for negative values or non-numeric inputs, which could lead to incorrect outputs or runtime errors. This means it does not fulfill the requirement of handling all potential cases as implied by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where either `radius` or `height` may be negative or non-numeric, which are not covered in the current implementation.
