Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It defines an inner function `is_prime` that accurately checks if a number is prime. This function handles all edge cases, such as numbers less than 2, and correctly identifies prime numbers by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

The outer function iterates through the range from 2 to `n`, calling `is_prime` for each number and counting how many are prime. Since all cases for non-negative integers are correctly handled (including the edge case of `n = 0` or `n = 1`, where the expected return value is 0), the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
