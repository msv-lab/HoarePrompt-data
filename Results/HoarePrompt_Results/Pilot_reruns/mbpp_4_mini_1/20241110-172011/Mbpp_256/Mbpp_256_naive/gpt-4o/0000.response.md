To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

**Problem Description:** Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    return sum(is_prime)
```

**Key points of the program:**
1. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, returning 0 in that case, which is correct because there are no primes less than 2.
2. It initializes a list `is_prime` where each index represents whether that number is prime.
3. It correctly marks 0 and 1 as non-prime.
4. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes method to find all prime numbers less than `n`.
5. Finally, it returns the count of prime numbers by summing the values in the `is_prime` list that are `True`.

**Testing Edge Cases:**
- For `n = 0`: It returns 0, which is correct.
- For `n = 1`: It returns 0, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`: It returns 0, which is correct.
- For `n = 3`: It returns 1 (only prime is 2), which is correct.
- For `n = 4`: It returns 2 (primes are 2, 3), which is correct.
- For `n = 5`: It returns 2 (primes are 2, 3), which is correct.
- For `n = 10`: It returns 4 (primes are 2, 3, 5, 7), which is correct.

After analyzing the logic and considering edge cases, I find that the code correctly implements the requirement of counting the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

Correctness: **True**.
