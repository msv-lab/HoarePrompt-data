The function returns `False`, and the value of `num` is either 3 or greater, while `i` is 3. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `num` is 3 or greater, `i` is 3, and the function returns False.

Output State: **`num` is 3 or greater, `i` is 3, and the function returns False**
