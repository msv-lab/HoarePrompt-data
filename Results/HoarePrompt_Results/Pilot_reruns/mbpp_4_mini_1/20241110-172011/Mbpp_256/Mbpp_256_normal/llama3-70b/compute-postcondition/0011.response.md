According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `num` is 16 or greater. 

To determine whether the loop can execute again, we need to check the value of `int(num ** 0.5)`. Since `num` is at least 16, `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4 (specifically, it is 4 when `num` is exactly 16). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 5. 

So, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` needs to be updated to 5 to prepare for the next iteration.
- `num` remains unchanged as it does not impact the loop's next execution in this context.

State: **`num` is 16 or greater, `i` is 5**
