The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a non-negative integer. 

- In Case 1, if `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`.
- In Case 2, if `num` is 2, the function does not return any value, indicating that its behavior is not defined for this input. If `num` is greater than 2, the function checks for divisibility by integers from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any of these integers, the function does not return any value, meaning its behavior remains undefined, and thus it does not confirm the primality of `num`.
- In Case 3, if `num` is at least 2 and not divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and return `False` if `num` is less than 2, return `True` if `num` is a prime number, and have an undefined behavior for `num` equal to 2 or when `num` is greater than 2 and passes the divisibility checks. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer num and returns False if num is less than 2; returns True if num is a prime number; otherwise, its behavior is undefined for num equal to 2 or for num greater than 2 that passes the divisibility checks.**
