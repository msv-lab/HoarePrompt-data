According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i * i` and goes up to `n`, incrementing by `i`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `i` is less than or equal to int(sqrt(n)),
- `j` is some value starting from `i * i`.

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `i * i` (the starting point for `j`) is less than `n`. Since `i` is currently less than or equal to int(sqrt(n)), we can conclude that `i * i` is less than or equal to `n`. However, we need to ensure that the next value of `j` (which will be `i * i + i`) is still less than `n`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` can take its next value:
- For the loop to execute one more time, we need `j` to be less than `n`, so we need to ensure that `i * i + i` is still less than `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, and `i` is less than or equal to int(sqrt(n))**
