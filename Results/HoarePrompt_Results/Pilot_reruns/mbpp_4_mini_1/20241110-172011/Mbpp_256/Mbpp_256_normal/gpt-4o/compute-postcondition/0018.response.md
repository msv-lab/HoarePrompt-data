The line `is_prime[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `is_prime`. Given that `is_prime[j]` was previously `False`, the state of this variable remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and the other elements of `is_prime`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state remains as follows: `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, and `i` is less than or equal to int(sqrt(n)).

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, and `i` is less than or equal to int(sqrt(n))**
