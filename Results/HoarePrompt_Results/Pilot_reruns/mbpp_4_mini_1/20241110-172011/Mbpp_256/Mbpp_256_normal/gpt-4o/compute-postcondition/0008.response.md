The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to False, and since `j` is 6, this updates the `is_prime` list at index 6 to False. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the other variables maintain their values. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to the `is_prime` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[6]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
