According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the current value of `i`. The loop starts at `i = 2` and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- If `n` is equal to 2, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged. 
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop may have executed for some values of `i`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
1. If `n` is greater than 2, then `i` should be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer value.
3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that this new value of `i` should still satisfy `i <= int(n ** 0.5)`.

If we denote the last value of `i` before the loop ended as `i_last`, then for the loop to execute one more time:
- We need to set `i` to `i_last + 1` and check if it is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`.

Thus, if `n` is greater than 2, we adjust `i` to `i_last + 1`. If `n` is equal to 2, the states remain unchanged as the loop does not execute.

Based on these observations, the necessary adjustments are:
- If `n` is greater than 2, set `i` to `i_last + 1`.
- If `n` is equal to 2, keep `i` as is.

Given that the last value of `i` will be `int(n ** 0.5)` at the end of the last iteration, we must set `i` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` and ensure that the condition for executing the loop is met.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`**
