According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `int(n)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next value, and we need to ensure that this new value of `i` is still within the range defined by `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

Since `i` is currently within the range up to `int(n)`, we need to adjust `i` to be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is for `i` to be set to `int(n ** 0.5)`, assuming that `i` was previously less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`**
