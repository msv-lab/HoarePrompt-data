Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False. If `is_prime[i]` is True and `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(n))`, then for indices `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` in increments of `i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False. If `i` is greater than or equal to `int(sqrt(n))`, `is_prime` remains unchanged. Additionally, `is_prime` remains unchanged for all indices less than `i * i` regardless of the value of `is_prime[i]`.***
