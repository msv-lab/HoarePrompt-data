The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned `False`, which indicates that `j` is not a prime number. The variable `j` has a value of `i * i + i`, and since `is_prime` is a list with `n` boolean values, this assignment updates the `is_prime` list accordingly. The values of `n`, `i`, and other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i * i + i`, `is_prime` is updated such that `is_prime[j]` is False, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i * i + i`**
