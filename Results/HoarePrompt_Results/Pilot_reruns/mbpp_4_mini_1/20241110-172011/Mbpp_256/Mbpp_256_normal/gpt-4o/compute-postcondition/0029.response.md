To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i * i, n, i)`. This means that the loop will generate values for `j` starting from `i * i` up to (but not including) `n`, incrementing `j` by `i` each time.

2. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is equal to `i * i + i`. This means that during the last iteration, `j` was set to `i * i + i`, which is the value calculated just after the loop's starting point.

3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n` in the next iteration. Currently, `j` is `i * i + i`. To ensure that the loop can run again, the next value of `j`, which will be `i * i + 2i`, must still be less than `n`.

4. So, we need to establish the condition that `i * i + 2i < n`, which translates to the requirement that `n` must be greater than `i * i + 2i`.

5. We also need to update the value of `j` to reflect the next iteration's starting point. Since `j` is currently `i * i + i`, for the next loop iteration, `j` should be set to `i * i + 2i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i * i + 2i, is_prime` is updated such that `is_prime[j]` is False, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i * i + 2i`**
