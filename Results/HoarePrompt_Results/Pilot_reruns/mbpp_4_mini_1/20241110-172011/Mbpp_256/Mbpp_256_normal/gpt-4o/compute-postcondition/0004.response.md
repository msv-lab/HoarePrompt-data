According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to the integer value of the square root of `n` plus 1. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, as the starting point of the loop is 2. If `n` is less than 2 (0 or 1), the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `i` would be initialized to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values set to True, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2**
