According to the given code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(n))`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and the loop variable `i` is at a value that is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(n))`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was at some value `k` (where `k` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(n))`), it should now be `k + 1`. Additionally, since `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices less than `i * i`, we need to ensure that `is_prime` is still defined appropriately for the new value of `i`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now `k + 1` and still less than or equal to `int(sqrt(n))`. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`, `i` is now `k + 1`**
