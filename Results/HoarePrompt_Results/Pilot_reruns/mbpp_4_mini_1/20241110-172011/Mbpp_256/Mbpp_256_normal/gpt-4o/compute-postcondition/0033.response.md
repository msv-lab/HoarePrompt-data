Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, and `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `int(n)`. If `is_prime[i]` is True and `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, then `is_prime[j]` is set to False for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to but not including `n`. If `n` is less than `i * i`, the list `is_prime` remains unchanged, retaining its previous values, including `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False.***
