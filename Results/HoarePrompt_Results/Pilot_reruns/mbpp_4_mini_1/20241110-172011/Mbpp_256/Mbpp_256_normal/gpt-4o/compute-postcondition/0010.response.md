The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. Since `j` is 8, we look at the list `is_prime` and set the value at index 8 to `False`. The values of `n`, `is_prime`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in the `is_prime` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 8, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[6]` is False, `is_prime[8]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 8**
