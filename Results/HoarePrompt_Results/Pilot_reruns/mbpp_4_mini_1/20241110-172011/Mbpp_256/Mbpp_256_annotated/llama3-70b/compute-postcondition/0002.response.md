According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. For the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 2, since the range starts from 2. Additionally, `i` will start at 2. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False, so we need to ensure `num` is 2 or greater for the loop to execute. 

State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
