The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where `n >= 2`) and returns the count of prime numbers between 2 and `n-1`. If `n` is exactly 2, the function returns 0 since there are no prime numbers in that range. If `n` is less than 2, the function will not execute the loop and will return 0, but the function is designed to only accept values of `n` that are 2 or greater. Thus, the main functionality is to count prime numbers in the specified range.
