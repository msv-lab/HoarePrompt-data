The function returns `False`, and `num` has a value of 2 or greater, while `i` has a value of 2. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2, and the function returns False**
