You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    #State of the program here: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is equal to the number of prime numbers between 2 and n-1. If n is exactly 2, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If n is greater than 2, the loop executes for each integer from 2 up to n-1, incrementing `count` for each prime number found. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0.
    return count
    #State of the program after the return statement: `count` is equal to the number of prime numbers between 2 and n-1, and the function returns `count`
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where `n >= 2`) and returns the count of prime numbers between 2 and `n-1`. If `n` is exactly 2, the function returns 0 since there are no prime numbers in that range. If `n` is less than 2, the function will not execute the loop and will return 0, but the function is designed to only accept values of `n` that are 2 or greater. Thus, the main functionality is to count prime numbers in the specified range.

#Function 2:
def is_prime(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #State of the program after the return statement: `num` is a non-negative integer, and the function returns False
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `num` is a non-negative integer, and the function returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`num` is a non-negative integer. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is 2 or greater, there is no return statement specified, implying that the function may complete without returning a value or may proceed to further steps not shown in the provided fragment.
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `num` is 2, the loop does not execute, and the function may complete without returning a value. If `num` is greater than 2, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 2 up to the integer value of the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is odd and greater than 2 and not divisible by any `i` up to the square root of `num`, the loop completes without returning a value, indicating `num` may be a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False immediately.
    return True
    #State of the program after the return statement: `num` is 2, indicating that the function completes without returning a value, and the function returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2. If `num` is 2, it returns `True`. For any integer greater than 2, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. However, if `num` is odd and greater than 2 and not divisible by any integer up to its square root, the function will still return `True`, as there are no further checks defined after the loop. Thus, the function may not explicitly handle all potential cases for odd numbers greater than 2 in terms of return values if the conditions are not met.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
