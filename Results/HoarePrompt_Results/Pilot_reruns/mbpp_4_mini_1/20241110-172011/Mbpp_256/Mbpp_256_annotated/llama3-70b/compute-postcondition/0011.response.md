According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition set by `num`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `num` is 16 or greater. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` (which is currently 4) needs to be incremented. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 

1. If `num` is exactly 16, then `int(num ** 0.5)` is 4, and the loop cannot execute again since 4 is not less than 4.
2. If `num` is greater than 16, say 17, then `int(num ** 0.5)` is 4, and again the loop cannot execute again since 4 is not less than 4.
3. If `num` is 25, then `int(num ** 0.5)` is 5, and the loop can execute again with `i` incremented to 5.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `num` to be greater than 16, specifically, it must be at least 25, and `i` should be updated to 5.

State: **`num` is 25 or greater, `i` is 5**
