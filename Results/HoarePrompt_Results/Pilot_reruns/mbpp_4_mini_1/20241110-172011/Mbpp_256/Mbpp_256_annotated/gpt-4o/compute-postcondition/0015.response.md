According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will start executing if `i * i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is equal to `int(n)` (which means it is the integer value of `n`), it follows that `i * i` will be equal to `n * n`, which is greater than or equal to `n` when `n` is greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to a value such that `i * i < n`. 

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to a value less than `sqrt(n)`, since `i` is currently equal to `int(n)`. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`**
