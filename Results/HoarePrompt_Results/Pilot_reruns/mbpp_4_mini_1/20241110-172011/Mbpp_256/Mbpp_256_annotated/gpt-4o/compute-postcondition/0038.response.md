The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. When `n` is greater than 2, the function initializes a list `is_prime` to track the primality of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, where indices represent the numbers themselves. It sets the first two entries (for 0 and 1) to `False`, marking them as non-prime. The function then uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify prime numbers by marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2 as `False`. Finally, it returns the sum of the values in `is_prime`, which counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`. However, the code does not handle the case for `n` equal to 3 correctly; it mistakenly counts 2 as a valid prime when `n` is less than 4 but does not explicitly return a value for `n` greater than 2 and less than 4. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, and counts the number of prime numbers less than `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for values of `n` greater than 2. However, it incorrectly handles the case when `n` is equal to 3 by not explicitly returning the expected count. **
