According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 12
- `n` is greater than 12

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 12 and `n` is greater than 12, the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied. However, to find the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `j` is updated in the loop.

In the loop, `j` is incremented by `i` (which is 3) for each iteration. Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will be updated to `j + i`, which means:
- `j` will become 15 (12 + 3).

Now we need to ensure that the new value of `j` (which will be 15) is still less than `n`. So, we can adjust the state as follows:
- `n` must be greater than 15 to ensure that the loop continues to execute.

Other states such as `is_prime` do not need to be adjusted as they are not relevant to the loop's execution and do not change in this context.

Thus, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is greater than 15, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[12]` is set to False, and `is_prime[9]` is False**
