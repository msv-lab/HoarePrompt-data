According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the current value of `i`. Since we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and `i` is in the range from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, we need to determine the maximum possible value for `i` that would allow the loop to run again.

The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. If `i` is currently 2 and `n` is at least 4, then the loop can execute. After the first iteration, `i` would increment by 1. 

Assuming `i` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3. We also need to ensure that `n` is still at least 4, which it already is.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 3.

No changes are needed for `is_prime`, as it remains unchanged for this iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `i` is 3**
