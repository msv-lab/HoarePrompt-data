Output State: **If n is at least 4, the function returns the sum of is_prime, where is_prime[j] is False for all j that are multiples of 2 and 3 up to n. If n is less than 4, the function returns the sum of is_prime unchanged (which is False for 0 and 1, True for 2, and potentially empty for n < 2).**
