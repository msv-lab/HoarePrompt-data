The loop marks the multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n` as not prime in the `is_prime` list. Given that `n` is at least 4 and `i` is 3, the loop will execute as long as `j` (which starts at `i * i`) is less than `n`.

If `n` is greater than or equal to 9, the loop will execute at least once. Specifically, it will mark `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, and `is_prime[15]` as False for each iteration as shown in the examples.

If `n` is less than 9, the loop will not execute because the starting value of `j` (which is `i * i` or 9) is not less than `n`.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **if n is at least 9, then `is_prime[j]` is False for all multiples of `i` (3) starting from `9` up to `n`, and `j` will take values 9, 12, 15, etc. If `n` is less than 9, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices 9 and above.**
