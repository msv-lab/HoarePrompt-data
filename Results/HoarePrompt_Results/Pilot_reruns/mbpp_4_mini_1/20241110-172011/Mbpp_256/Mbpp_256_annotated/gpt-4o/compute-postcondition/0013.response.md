Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True. If `is_prime[2]` is True, all multiples of 2 up to `n` are marked as False in `is_prime`, including `is_prime[4]` if `n` is exactly 4. Thus, `is_prime[j]` is set to False for all `j` that are multiples of 2 (starting from `2 * 2` up to `n`). If `n` is greater than 4, the loop will process multiple values of `j`, marking them as non-prime. If `n` is less than 4, the state of `is_prime` remains unchanged.***
