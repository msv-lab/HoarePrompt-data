Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, and `i` is 3. If `n` is at least 9, then for all multiples of `i` (3) starting from 9 up to `n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False, where `j` takes values 9, 12, 15, etc. If `n` is less than 9, the `is_prime` array remains unchanged for indices 9 and above.***
