The code assigns the value `False` to `is_prime[j]`. The current value of `j` is 15. Since `is_prime[15]` is being set to `False`, it does not change the values of the other variables in the initial state.

The initial values are:
- `n` is greater than 15
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 15
- `is_prime[12]` is False
- `is_prime[9]` is False

The value of `is_prime[15]` is now explicitly set to `False`, but since it was not specified in the initial state, we do not know its previous value. Thus, the output state reflects the change.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 15, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[12]` is False, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[15]` is False**
