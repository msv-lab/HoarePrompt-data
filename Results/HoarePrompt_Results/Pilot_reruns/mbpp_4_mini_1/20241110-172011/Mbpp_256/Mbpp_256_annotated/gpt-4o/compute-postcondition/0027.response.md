According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is greater than 9
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 9

The next value of `j` will be calculated as `j + i`, which is `9 + 3 = 12`. 

Since `n` is greater than 9, we need to check if `j` (which will become 12) is still less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 12.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and `is_prime[9]` is set to False**
