The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, there is no return value specified in this fragment. If `n` is at least 4, the function returns the sum of `is_prime`, where `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` that are multiples of 2 and 3 up to `n`. If `n` is less than 4, the function returns the sum of `is_prime` unchanged (which is False for 0 and 1, True for 2, and potentially empty for `n` < 2). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, it returns the sum of certain prime values, while for values of `n` less than 4, it returns the sum of `is_prime` unchanged. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n, returns 0 if n is less than or equal to 2. If n is at least 4, it returns the sum of is_prime values with certain conditions applied.**
