The code initializes a list called `is_prime` with `n` elements, all set to `True`. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is 0, the list will be empty. If `n` is 1, the list will contain one element which is `True`. If `n` is 2, the list will contain two elements, both `True`. For values of `n` greater than 2, the list will contain `n` elements, all set to `True`. 

Since the function's return behavior is conditional based on the value of `n`, and since the code snippet does not include a return statement, the output state will reflect the initialization of `is_prime`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of size `n`, all elements are `True`.**
