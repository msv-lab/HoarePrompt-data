Initially, the function `func_1(lst, tpl)` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and concatenates them by converting the tuple to a list. The program seems to fulfill the basic requirement of adding the elements of a tuple to a list, as evidenced by the assertions provided.

However, upon closer inspection, there are potential edge cases that are not handled by the code. Specifically, there are no type checks for the input parameters. If the function is called with a non-list for `lst` or a non-tuple for `tpl`, it will raise a `TypeError`. For example:

- Calling `func_1("not a list", (1, 2))` would raise a `TypeError` because the first argument is a string, not a list.
- Calling `func_1([1, 2, 3], "not a tuple")` would also raise a `TypeError` since the second argument is a string, not a tuple.

The output hints state that there are no checks for the types of `lst` or `tpl`, which aligns with the observations made about the function. This indicates that the function does not meet the problem description for all potential cases, as it fails to handle invalid input types properly.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not handle invalid types for `lst` and `tpl`, which could lead to errors when used with inputs that do not match the expected types.
