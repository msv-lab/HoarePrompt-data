Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the input list is empty. Specifically, if `lst` is an empty list and `tup` is a tuple, the program will return a new list that is the same as the converted tuple. However, the problem description specifies that the function should add the given tuple to the list, which implies that it should also work with an empty list. 

For example:
- If `lst = []` and `tup = (1, 2)`, the function will return `[1, 2]`. This is correct.
- However, if `lst = [3]` and `tup = ()`, the function will return `[3]`, which is correct.
- If `lst = []` and `tup = ()`, the function will return `[]`, which is correct.

However, the problem description suggests that the function should add the tuple to the list, meaning it should handle cases where the tuple might not be empty, but the list is. 

The potential issue arises when considering how the function interprets an empty tuple or a tuple with varying sizes. The function does not explicitly check or clarify that the tuple should always be added to the list, leading to ambiguities in its handling.

Thus, the program's behavior is not explicitly defined for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
