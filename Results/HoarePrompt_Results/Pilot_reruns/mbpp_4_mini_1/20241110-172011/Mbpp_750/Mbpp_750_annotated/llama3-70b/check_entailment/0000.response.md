Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is supposed to add a given tuple to a given list. However, the function does not handle cases where the inputs are not of the expected types. According to the annotations, the function does not check if `lst` is a list or if `tup` is a tuple, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

For example, if `lst` is a string or an integer instead of a list, or if `tup` is a list instead of a tuple, the program will not behave correctly. Instead of returning a new list as specified in the problem description, it might raise an error or return an incorrect result.

The annotations highlight this limitation by stating that the function "does not handle cases where `lst` is not a list or `tup` is not a tuple." This directly implies that the function may fail for such cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect. 

In summary, since the program does not ensure that the inputs are of the correct types and can fail for those edge cases, the correctness is deemed to be false.
