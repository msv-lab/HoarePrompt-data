The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tup`. `lst` is a list, and `tup` is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns the concatenation of `lst` with the list conversion of `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return a new list that is formed by concatenating `lst` with the elements of `tup` converted to a list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tup, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of lst with the elements of tup converted to a list.**
