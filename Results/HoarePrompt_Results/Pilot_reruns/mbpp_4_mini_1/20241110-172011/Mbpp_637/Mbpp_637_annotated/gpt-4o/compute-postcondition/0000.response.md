The function returns the boolean value of the comparison `cost_price == selling_price`. The values of `cost_price` and `selling_price` are numerical values, but their exact values are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific boolean outcome of the comparison. Therefore, the output state is `cost_price` and `selling_price` are numerical values, and the function returns a boolean result based on their equality.
