Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether the given cost price and selling price are equal, which indicates that there is no profit or loss. 

- If `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, it returns `True`, meaning no profit or loss.
- If they are not equal, it returns `False`, indicating either profit or loss.

This logic correctly fulfills the requirement of the problem description for all potential cases, including edge cases like when both prices are zero. Thus, the program is correct.
