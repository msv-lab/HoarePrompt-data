Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum of two numbers, `a` and `b`. It uses a simple conditional expression that returns `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, and `b` otherwise. 

The assertions provided cover various scenarios:
1. `func_1(5, 10)` returns `10`, which is correct.
2. `func_1(-1, -2)` returns `-1`, which is also correct.
3. `func_1(9, 7)` returns `9`, confirming the implementation works for positive numbers as well.

Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and correctly identifies the maximum of the two numbers in all scenarios, it meets the problem description requirements. Thus, the program is correct.
