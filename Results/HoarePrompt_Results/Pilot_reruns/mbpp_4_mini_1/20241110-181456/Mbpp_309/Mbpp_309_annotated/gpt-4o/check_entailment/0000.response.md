Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality to find the maximum of two numbers as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(a, b)` uses the conditional expression to return `a` if it is greater than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. 

The annotations confirm that the function takes two comparable parameters and correctly identifies the greater value. They also state that if both values are equal, the function will return either `a` or `b`, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem.

No edge cases or potential issues have been identified where the function would not operate as intended. It handles all cases, including when the inputs are equal, negative numbers, or different data types that can be compared. Given that the function satisfies the problem requirements in all scenarios, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
