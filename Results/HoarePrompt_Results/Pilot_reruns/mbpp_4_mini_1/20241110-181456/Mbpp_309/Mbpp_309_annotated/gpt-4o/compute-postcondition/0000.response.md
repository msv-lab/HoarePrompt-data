The function returns `a` if `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, it returns `b`. Since `a` and `b` are comparable values, the output will depend on their specific values, but the exact values are not provided. The return statement does not change the state of the variables themselves. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are comparable values, and the function returns the greater of the two.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are comparable values, and the function returns the greater of the two**
