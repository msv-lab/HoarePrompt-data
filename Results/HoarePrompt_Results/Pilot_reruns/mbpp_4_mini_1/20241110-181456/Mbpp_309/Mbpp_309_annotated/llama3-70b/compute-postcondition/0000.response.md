The function returns `max(a, b)`, which computes the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` can be any comparable values, the output will depend on their specific values. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `a` and `b` can be any comparable values, and the function returns the maximum of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` can be any comparable values, and the function returns max(a, b)**
