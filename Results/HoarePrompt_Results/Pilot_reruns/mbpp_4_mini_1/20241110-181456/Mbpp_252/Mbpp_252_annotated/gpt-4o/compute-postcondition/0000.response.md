The function returns the polar coordinates of the complex number represented by the string `num`. The `complex(num)` function converts the string representation of the complex number into a complex number object, and then `cmath.polar()` computes its polar coordinates, which are a tuple containing the magnitude and the phase angle. The state of the variable `num` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a string that represents a complex number in the form 'a+bj', and the function returns the polar coordinates of that complex number.**
