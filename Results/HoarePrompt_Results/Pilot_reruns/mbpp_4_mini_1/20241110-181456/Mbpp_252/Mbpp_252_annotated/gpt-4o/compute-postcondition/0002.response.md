Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `num` that represents a complex number in the form 'a+bj' and returns the polar coordinates (magnitude and phase) of that complex number using the `cmath.polar` function. The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., strings that do not represent valid complex numbers), which may result in a runtime error. Therefore, if `num` is not a valid complex number, it could lead to an exception instead of returning polar coordinates. **
