The function returns the result of `cmath.polar(complex(num))`, which gives the polar coordinates (magnitude and phase) of the complex number represented by `num`. The value of `num` remains unchanged. Since `num` can be a valid complex number, the output state reflects that the function returns the polar representation of that complex number. 

Output State: **`num` is a valid complex number; the function returns the polar coordinates of the complex number represented by `num`**
