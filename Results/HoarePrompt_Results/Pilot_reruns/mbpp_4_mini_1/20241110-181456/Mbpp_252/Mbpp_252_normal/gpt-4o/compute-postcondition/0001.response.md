The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a valid complex number, which can be provided as a string or a numerical type that can be converted to a complex number. After executing the function body, it returns the polar coordinates of the complex number represented by `num`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a valid complex number input and return its polar coordinates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num, which is a valid complex number, and returns the polar coordinates of the complex number represented by num.**
