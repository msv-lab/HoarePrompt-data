To assess the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we must analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Analysis of the Code:
The code defines a function `func_1(num)` that converts a given complex number to its polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function. The polar coordinates are returned as a tuple containing the modulus and the phase angle of the complex number.

### Problem Description:
The problem description states that the function should convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. It also implies that the input should be a valid complex number.

### Output Hints:
The output hints clarify that the function accepts a parameter `num`, which should be a valid complex number, and returns its polar coordinates as a tuple of its modulus and phase angle. They also mention that if `num` is not a valid complex number, the function may raise an error, which indicates that the function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Non-complex Inputs:** The program does not handle cases where `num` is not a complex number (e.g., passing a string, list, or other types). If a non-complex number is passed, the `complex(num)` call will raise a ValueError or TypeError, leading to a crash instead of returning a meaningful result.
2. **Handling of Complex Numbers:** The code does correctly convert valid complex numbers (including integers, floats, and complex literals) to polar coordinates.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle the edge case of invalid input types, which means it does not follow the problem description for every potential case since it does not provide a graceful handling of non-complex input.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle cases where the input is not a valid complex number, leading to potential errors that violate the problem requirements.
