To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program and check if it correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates.

The provided program is:

```python
def func_1(c):
    return (abs(c), cmath.phase(c))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Input**: The function `func_1` takes a complex number `c` as input.
2. **Output**: The function returns a tuple containing:
   - The magnitude of the complex number, calculated using `abs(c)`.
   - The phase (or argument) of the complex number, calculated using `cmath.phase(c)`.

### Problem Description Requirements:

The problem requires converting complex numbers to polar coordinates, which involves:
- Magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number.
- Angle (or phase) of the complex number.

### Validity Check:

- The `abs(c)` function correctly computes the magnitude of a complex number.
- The `cmath.phase(c)` function accurately computes the phase of the complex number.

### Edge Cases:

- **Zero Input**: If the input is `0 + 0j`, the expected output in polar coordinates is (0, 0). The code should handle this case correctly.
- **Purely Real Input**: For example, `5 + 0j` should return (5, 0).
- **Purely Imaginary Input**: For example, `0 + 5j` should return (5, π/2).
- **Negative Real Input**: For example, `-5 + 0j` should return (5, π).

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the implementation, I cannot find any case where the function does not correctly convert complex numbers to polar coordinates as specified in the problem description. The function handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
