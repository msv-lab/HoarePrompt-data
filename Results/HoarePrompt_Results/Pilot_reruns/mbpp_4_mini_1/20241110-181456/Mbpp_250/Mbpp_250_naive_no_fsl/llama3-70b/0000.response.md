Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple and an element, and it uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element within the tuple. 

The `count` method is designed to return the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple, which directly aligns with the requirement of the problem statement. 

Here are a few examples to illustrate its correctness:

1. If the input is `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 1), 1)`, the output will be `3`, as `1` appears three times in the tuple.
2. If the input is `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)`, the output will be `0`, as `4` does not appear in the tuple.
3. If the input is `func_1((), 1)`, the output will be `0`, as the tuple is empty.

In all potential cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
