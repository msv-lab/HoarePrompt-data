Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to count the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The use of `tup.count(element)` correctly returns the number of times `element` appears in `tup`.

The annotations confirm that `tup` is a tuple and `element` can be of any data type, which is consistent with the problem description. Additionally, the annotation mentions that if `tup` is empty, the function will correctly return 0, which is also aligned with the expected behavior of the `count` method in Python.

Since there are no edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem description requirements, I conclude that the implementation is correct for all potential cases.
