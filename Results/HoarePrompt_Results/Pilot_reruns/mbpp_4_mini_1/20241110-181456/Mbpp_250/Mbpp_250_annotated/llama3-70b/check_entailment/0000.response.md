Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the input `tup` is not a tuple. According to the problem description, the function should take in a tuple and an element, but the code does not validate whether `tup` is indeed a tuple before attempting to call the `.count()` method. 

For example, if we pass a list (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3], 2)`), the program will raise an AttributeError since lists do not have a `.count()` method. This indicates that the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. The annotations mention that the function does not handle cases where `tup` is not a tuple, which further supports the conclusion that the program is not correct. 

Thus, the program fails to cover all potential cases specified in the problem description, leading to its correctness being deemed false.
