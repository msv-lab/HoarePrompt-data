The function returns a new string that consists of only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. The value of `s` remains unchanged. The return statement does not modify the state of `s`, but it does produce a resultant string based on its contents. Therefore, the output state reflects the original string and the returned value.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing any combination of uppercase and lowercase characters, and the function returns a string of uppercase characters from `s`.**
