Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, which implies that the function should return a string containing only uppercase characters, without changing the order of those characters. However, the implementation of the function simply returns a new string that contains only the uppercase characters extracted from the original string. 

The annotations state that the function returns a string of uppercase characters from `s`, which aligns with the implementation. However, the problem description specifically asks for the removal of lowercase substrings, not just the extraction of uppercase characters. 

An example where the program fails is the input string "HelloWorld". The expected behavior according to the problem description would be to return the string "HW", which represents the uppercase letters, but indicates that lowercase letters are removed. However, the functionâ€™s return value is "HW", which is indeed correct for uppercase extraction but does not address the removal of lowercase substrings.

In another example, for the input string "abcDEF", the expected output according to the problem description would be "DEF", indicating that all lowercase letters are removed, but the program only extracts uppercase letters and does not explicitly handle lowercase substrings as described.

Thus, since the implementation does not fulfill the requirement of removing lowercase substrings completely and instead only extracts uppercase characters, the program is incorrect.
