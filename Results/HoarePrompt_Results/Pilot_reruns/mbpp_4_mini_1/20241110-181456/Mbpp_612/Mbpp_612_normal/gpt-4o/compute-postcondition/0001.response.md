The variable `second_elements` is assigned the values of the second elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The variable `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, each containing exactly two elements. Therefore, `second_elements` will now contain all the second elements from these sublists, while `first_elements` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `first_elements` is a list of the first elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `second_elements` is a list of the second elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
