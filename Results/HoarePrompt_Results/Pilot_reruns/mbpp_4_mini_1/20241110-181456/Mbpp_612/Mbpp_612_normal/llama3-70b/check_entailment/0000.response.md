The program is intended to take a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements, and return a list of two lists: the first containing the first elements of each sublist and the second containing the second elements. 

Analyzing the code:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list((element[0] for element in list_of_lists)), list((element[1] for element in list_of_lists))]
```
The code uses list comprehensions to extract the first and second elements from each sublist. However, it assumes that every sublist contains exactly two elements. If any sublist has fewer than two elements, it will raise an `IndexError` when it attempts to access `element[1]`. 

Now, checking the Output hints:
The output hints state that the function may raise an `IndexError` if any sublist does not contain exactly two elements. This aligns with the observation made from reviewing the code. 

Considering edge cases:
1. If the input is an empty list (`[]`), the output will be `[[], []]`, which is valid.
2. If a sublist contains only one element (e.g., `[[1]]`), it will raise an `IndexError`.
3. If a sublist contains more than two elements (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3]]`), it will still work correctly because it only accesses the first two elements, but this situation is not handled according to the problem description, which states that each sublist should have exactly two elements.

Because the function does not handle cases where sublists do not have exactly two elements, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails in cases where any sublist does not meet the requirement of having exactly two elements, resulting in an `IndexError`.
