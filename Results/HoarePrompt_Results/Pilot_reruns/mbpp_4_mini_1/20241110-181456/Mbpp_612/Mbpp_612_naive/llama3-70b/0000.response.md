Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly takes a list of lists, where each sublist is expected to contain exactly two elements. It extracts the first element from each sublist and constructs a new list of these first elements. Similarly, it extracts the second element from each sublist to create a second list of these elements. 

Here's a potential input and the expected output:
- Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`
- Output: `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`

The program handles this input correctly. It will also handle edge cases such as:
- An empty list of lists: `[]` will yield `[[], []]`.
- A list containing empty sublists: `[[], []]` will yield `[[], []]`, which is also correct.

Since the program works as expected for various potential cases without missing any logic or edge cases, it is deemed correct.
