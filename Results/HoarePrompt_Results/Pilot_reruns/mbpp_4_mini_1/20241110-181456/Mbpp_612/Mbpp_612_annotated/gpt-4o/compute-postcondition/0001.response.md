The code creates a new list called `second_elements` that contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The `list_of_lists` is not specified in terms of its content, but it is stated that each sublist contains exactly two elements. Therefore, the `second_elements` list will contain the second elements from each of these sublists. The `first_elements` list remains unaffected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list of the first elements of those sublists; `second_elements` is a list of the second elements of those sublists.**
