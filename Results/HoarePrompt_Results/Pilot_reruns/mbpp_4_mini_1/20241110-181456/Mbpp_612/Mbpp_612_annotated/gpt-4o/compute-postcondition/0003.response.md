The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, it constructs `first_elements`, a list of the first elements of those sublists, and `second_elements`, a list of the second elements of those sublists. The function then returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists, each containing two elements, and return a list with two sublists: one containing the first elements and the other containing the second elements of the original sublists.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing exactly two elements each, and returns a list with two sublists: one with the first elements and another with the second elements of the sublists.**
