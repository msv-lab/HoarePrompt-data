The code assigns to `first_elements` a new list that contains the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements, `first_elements` will be a list containing the first elements of all the sublists.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the original value of `list_of_lists` and the newly created `first_elements` list. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list of the first elements of those sublists.**
