The code returns a list containing two elements. The first element is a list created by taking the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second element is a list created by taking the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The state of `list_of_lists` is unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the structure of `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements, and the function returns a list of two lists: one for the first elements and one for the second elements of the sublists.**
