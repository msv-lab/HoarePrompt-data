The function accepts a list of sublists, where each sublist is expected to contain exactly two elements. It returns a list containing two lists: the first of which contains all the first elements of the sublists, and the second contains all the second elements. If any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, it will raise an `IndexError` due to attempting to access non-existent indices.
