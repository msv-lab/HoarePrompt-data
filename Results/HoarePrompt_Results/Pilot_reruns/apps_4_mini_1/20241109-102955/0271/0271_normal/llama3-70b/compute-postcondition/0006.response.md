The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The specific output of the function is not provided in the task, so we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate within the constraints of `n` being a non-negative integer within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with the constraint that n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The return value is not specified.**
