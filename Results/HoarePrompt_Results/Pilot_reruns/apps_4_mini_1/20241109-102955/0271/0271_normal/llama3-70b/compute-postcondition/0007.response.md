Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user. It prints `n` if it is a multiple of 10. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it prints the nearest multiple of 10: rounding down if the last digit is 5 or less, and rounding up if the last digit is greater than 5. Thus, it effectively rounds the input `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. **
