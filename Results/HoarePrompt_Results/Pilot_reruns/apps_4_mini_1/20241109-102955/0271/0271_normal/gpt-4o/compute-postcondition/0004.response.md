Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; if the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is set to `n - remainder`, effectively rounding `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. Otherwise, if the remainder is greater than 5, `result` is set to `n + (10 - remainder)`, rounding `n` up to the nearest multiple of 10, which can result in `result` being `n + 1`, `n + 2`, ..., or `n + 10` depending on the value of `remainder`.***
