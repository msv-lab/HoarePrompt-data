Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where n is exactly halfway between two multiples of ten correctly. For example, if n = 15, the expected outputs are either 10 or 20, but the program would output 20, which is not a valid output option according to the problem description. 

Additionally, it doesn't explicitly check for the case where n is 5; while it could output 0 or 10, the logic provided will always lead to the output of 10, which violates the requirement that either answer is correct.
