The code snippet provided is a print statement that will output the value of `result`, which is calculated based on the values of `n` and `remainder`. 

The value of `result` depends on the value of `remainder`:
- If `remainder` ≤ 5, then `result` = `n - remainder`.
- If `remainder` > 5, then `result` = `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Since the specific values of `n` and `remainder` are not provided, the output state cannot specify exact values for `result`. However, we can describe the conditions affecting the calculation of `result`.

Output State: **`result` is calculated based on `n` and `remainder` as follows: if `remainder` ≤ 5, then `result` = `n - remainder`; if `remainder` > 5, then `result` = `n + (10 - remainder)`, and the function prints `result`.**
