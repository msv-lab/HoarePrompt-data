Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`, which will be a non-negative integer. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`, which will also be a non-negative integer. This ensures that `result` remains within the bounds of non-negative integers for all valid inputs of `n` and `remainder`.***
