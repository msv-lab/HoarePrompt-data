The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate without input arguments. Given the constraints, if `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the function will return a result based on the value of `n`. However, since there are no specific output cases provided in the description, we cannot detail what the function returns for different values of `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a result based on the internal logic related to a non-negative integer `n` within the range \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\).**
