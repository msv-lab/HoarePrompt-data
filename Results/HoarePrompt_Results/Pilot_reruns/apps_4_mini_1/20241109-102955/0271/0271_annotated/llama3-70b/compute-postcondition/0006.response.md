The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to perform some computation based on internal logic or a predetermined state. According to the output specification provided, it should return a result that is relevant to the constraints defined (non-negative integer `n` such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). However, since the specific output based on the computation is not detailed in the provided information, we cannot specify the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a result based on internal logic related to a non-negative integer `n` within the range of 0 to 10^9.**
