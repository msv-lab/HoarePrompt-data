The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `t` is a non-empty substring of digits that may contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it constructs a new string `n` containing characters from `s` that are found in a set of characters derived from `t` plus the substring `t` itself. The function then returns the integer value of the string `n` by converting it using `int(n)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string of digits `s` and a non-empty substring of digits `t`, and return the integer representation of a new string formed by combining specific characters from `s` and `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty substring `t` of digits, returning the integer representation of a new string constructed from `s` and `t`.**
