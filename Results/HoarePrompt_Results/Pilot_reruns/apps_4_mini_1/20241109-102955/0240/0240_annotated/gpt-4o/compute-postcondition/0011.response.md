Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string representation of the third permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` does not satisfy the validity check, no action is taken (the function does not yield anything).***
