The function accepts a string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns a boolean indicating whether `sub` is present in `num_str` and whether the length of `num_str` matches a variable `n_len`. However, the variable `n_len` is not defined within the function, which could lead to a NameError if the function is executed. Therefore, the function's intended behavior is to validate the presence of `sub` in `num_str` and check its length against a potentially undefined `n_len`.
