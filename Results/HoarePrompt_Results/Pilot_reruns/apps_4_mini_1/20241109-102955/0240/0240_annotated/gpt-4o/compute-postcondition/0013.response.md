Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with length between 1 and 1,000,000, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string representation of that permutation. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`, it is yielded. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `sub` is not a valid number or contains only leading zeroes, this may affect the validity check but does not prevent the loop from executing; however, it may lead to no candidates being yielded.**
