The `yield` statement produces a value, allowing the function to return the `candidate` without terminating it. The previous values of the variables do not change as a result of this yield statement. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string representation of the third permutation of `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string representation of the third permutation of `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`**
