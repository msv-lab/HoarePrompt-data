Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars` as a string. If `candidate` is a valid number as determined by the `is_valid_number` function, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, there is no yield, and the function does not produce any output.***
