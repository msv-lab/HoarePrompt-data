To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Vasya has a large integer `n` represented as a string, which has been shuffled.
2. He appends the number of digits in `n` (denoted as `k`) to `n`.
3. Given a substring of `n`, the task is to reconstruct the smallest possible `n` that could have produced the shuffled string.

### Provided Program:
```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)
print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: It reads two strings `s` (the shuffled number) and `t` (the remembered substring).
2. **Character Collection**: It creates a set from `t` and iterates over `s`, appending characters from `s` that are also in `t_set` to `n`.
3. **Appending Substring**: Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The program constructs `n` by appending characters from `s` that match `t` and then appending `t`. This could lead to leading zeros in the final result if `n` starts with zero(s) and `t` also starts with zero(s). For example:
   - If `s = "000123"` and `t = "01"`, the current logic would produce `n = "0001" + "01" = "000101"`, which translates to `101` when converted to an integer. However, the expected output should be `000101` or `101` based on the rules of leading zeros.
2. **Missing Logic for All Characters**: The program only collects characters from `s` that are in `t`. It doesn't consider that `n` must also include characters that are not part of `t` but are present in `s`. This could lead to incorrect results if there are characters in `s` that are not in `t` but are required to form the smallest possible `n`.

### Example to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
- `s = "003512"`
- `t = "021"`

Expected logic:
- The smallest `n` should be constructed by considering all digits from `s` and then appending `t`. The ideal output could be `30021` (where `3` is taken from `s` to minimize the value of `n`).

With the current implementation:
- It would produce `n = "003" + "021" = "003021"`, which becomes `3021` when converted to an integer. This does not respect the requirement of forming the smallest integer correctly as it may omit necessary digits.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to handle cases with leading zeros and does not consider all characters in `s`, it does not meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
