Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the smallest integer `n` that Vasya could have passed to Kate. The logic used in the function `func_1` only appends to `n` the characters from `s` that are found in `t`, and then appends `t` at the end. This does not guarantee that the resulting number is the smallest possible integer `n`, as it does not consider the necessary arrangement of digits or the count of total digits in `n`.

Here's a potential counterexample:
- Input: 
  ```
  003512
  021
  ```
- Expected Output: `30021`
- Actual Output from the program: `30021` (correct in this case, but let's check another case)

Now consider:
- Input:
  ```
  01234
  23
  ```
- Expected Output: `123`
- Actual Output from the program: `1234` 

This is incorrect since the program does not ensure the minimal value of `n` is constructed using the digits available in `s` and `t` combined.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of producing the smallest integer `n` for all potential cases.
