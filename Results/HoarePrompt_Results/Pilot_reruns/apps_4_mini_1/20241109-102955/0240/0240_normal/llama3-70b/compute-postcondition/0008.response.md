According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, and `c` is the second character of `s`. Since `c` is already established as the second character, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be updated to the next character in `s`. 

Thus, we need to adjust `c` to be the next character in `s`. Additionally, since `c` is in `t_set` could potentially trigger an error, it does not affect the loop's ability to execute again, so we do not need to modify `t_set`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the third character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty substring containing digits, and `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`.**
