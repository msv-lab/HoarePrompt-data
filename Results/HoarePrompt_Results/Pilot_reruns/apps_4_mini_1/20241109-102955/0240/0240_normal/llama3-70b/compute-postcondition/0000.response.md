The variable `t_set` is assigned the value of `set(t)`, which creates a set of unique characters from the string `t`. Since `t` is a non-empty substring containing digits, `t_set` will contain only the distinct digits present in `t`. The initial state of `s` remains unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring containing digits; `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`.**
