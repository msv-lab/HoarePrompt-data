The function accepts a string `s` containing digits and a non-empty substring `t` of digits. It constructs a new string `n` by including all characters from `s` that are also present in `t`, followed by appending `t` to this string. The function then converts `n` to an integer and returns it. If `s` contains no characters that match those in `t`, the function returns the integer value of `t`. If both `s` and `t` are empty or invalid (though `t` is said to be non-empty), the behavior may lead to an error during conversion to integer.
