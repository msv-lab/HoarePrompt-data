According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to move to the next permutation in the sequence generated by `permutations(chars)`.

Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, it needs to be adjusted to the next permutation in the lexicographical order of permutations of `chars`. The `permutations` function generates all permutations of `chars`, and since permutations are generated in order, we need to ensure that `perm` reflects the next permutation.

Therefore, `perm` should be adjusted to the next permutation based on the ordering of permutations of `chars`. As `candidate` is formed by joining `perm`, it will automatically adjust to the new `perm`. There's no need to change `chars` or `sub` since they are not modified within the loop. 

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining the next `perm`.**
