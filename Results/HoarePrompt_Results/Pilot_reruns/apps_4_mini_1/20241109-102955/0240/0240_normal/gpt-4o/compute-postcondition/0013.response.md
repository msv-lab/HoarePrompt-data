Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits; `perm` is each permutation of `chars` in sequence. `candidate` is formed by joining `perm`. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains valid digits and the permutations generate valid candidates according to `is_valid_number` with respect to `sub`, those candidates will be yielded. If no valid candidates are found, the loop completes without yielding any output.**
