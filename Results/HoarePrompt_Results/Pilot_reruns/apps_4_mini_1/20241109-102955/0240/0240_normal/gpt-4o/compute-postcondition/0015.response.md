Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `chars` representing shuffled digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It generates and yields all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the condition defined by the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is empty, the function will yield no candidates, and if no valid permutations are found, the function completes without yielding any output. **
