The function accepts two integers `n` (ranging from 1 to 100) and `m` (ranging from 1 to `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers representing colors (each between 1 and `m`), and a list of `m` integers representing counts of those colors. It checks if there is a contiguous subsequence of colors that matches the exact counts specified in the counts list. If such a subsequence is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the specified constraints, such as when `n` or `m` are outside their defined ranges.
