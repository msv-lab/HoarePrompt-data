Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and each value is the count of occurrences of that color. If `colors` is a list with at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `colors`. If `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.**
