Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, and `color` is the first element in `colors`. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
