The statement `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the value of the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. If `color` was not previously a key in `window_counts`, it was initialized to 0, and now it becomes 1 after the increment. If `color` was already present, its value is increased by 1. The state of other variables (`found`, `i`, `n`, `j`) is not affected by this operation.

Given that `window_counts[color]` is updated based on the presence of `color`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 (initially 0 or previous value + 1)**.
