The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by converting a space-separated string of integers from input into integers. The initial constraints state that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. This means that the length of the list `colors` must equal `n`, and each integer in `colors` must be within the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}**
