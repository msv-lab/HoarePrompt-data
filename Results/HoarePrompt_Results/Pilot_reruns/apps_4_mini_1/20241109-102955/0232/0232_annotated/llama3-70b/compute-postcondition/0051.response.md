According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the loop can indeed execute. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will take on the value of `i` (which is 1) in the first iteration. The state of the other variables (`found`, `window_counts`) does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states to ensure the loop can execute are:
- `i` is 1 (as provided)
- `n` is greater than 1 (as provided)
- `j` is now 1 (the starting value for the loop)

State: **`found` is True or False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is 1**
