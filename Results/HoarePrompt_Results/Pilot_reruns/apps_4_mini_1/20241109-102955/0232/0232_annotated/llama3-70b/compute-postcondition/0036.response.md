Postcondition: ***If `color` is `colors[1]`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or its previous value incremented by 1, then all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, resulting in `found` being set to True and breaking out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains True, and the program continues without breaking.***
