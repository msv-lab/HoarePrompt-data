Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[3]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and all other precondition values remain unchanged.***
