Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `n` is 0, `found` remains False, `i` is 0, and `window_counts` is still an empty dictionary, indicating that no sequence of colors was found. Otherwise, if a valid sequence of colors exists from index `i` to `n-1`, `found` indicates this condition.***
