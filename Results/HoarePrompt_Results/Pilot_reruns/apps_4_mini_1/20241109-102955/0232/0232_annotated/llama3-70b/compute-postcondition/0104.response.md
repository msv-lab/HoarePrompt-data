Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 4, `color` is assigned colors[4], and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts of the sorted values in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` remains True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the conditions are not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
