The function returns the string 'YES'. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑(i=1 to m) k_i ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k, `current_counts` is updated for the color at index `right`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the function returns 'YES'.
