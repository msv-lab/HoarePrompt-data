Output State: **`current_counts` contains the count of each color seen up to index `right`, `left` is the index from which the window of colors starts, and `right` is the index of the last color processed. If `current_counts` never meets the `desired_counts`, `left` remains 0 and the loop does not execute, meaning no return occurs. If `current_counts` matches `desired_counts` at any point, the function returns 'YES'. If `n` is 0 or if `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute, `left` remains 0, and the function does not return anything.**
