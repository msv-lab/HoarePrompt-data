According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `colors` list. For the loop to execute, the `colors` list must contain at least one element. Since it is given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, we know that `colors` will have `n` integers. Therefore, `colors` is guaranteed to have at least 1 element.

At the start of the loop, the variable `color` will take on the value of the first element in the `colors` list. Therefore, we need to specify that `color` is initialized to be the first element of the `colors` list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color` is the first element of the `colors` list**
