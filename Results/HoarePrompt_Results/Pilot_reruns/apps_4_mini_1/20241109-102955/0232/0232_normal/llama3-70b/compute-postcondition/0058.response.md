Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. The values of `i` and `j` remain at 0, and `n` continues to be greater than 0. If the condition is not satisfied, `found` remains False, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
