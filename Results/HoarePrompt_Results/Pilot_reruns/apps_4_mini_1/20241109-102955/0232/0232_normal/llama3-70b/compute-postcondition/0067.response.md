According to the code, the loop iterates from `i` to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`, and `j` should also be adjusted to reflect this new value.

State: **`color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `j` is adjusted to `i + 1` (which is `2`), and `n` remains unchanged.**
