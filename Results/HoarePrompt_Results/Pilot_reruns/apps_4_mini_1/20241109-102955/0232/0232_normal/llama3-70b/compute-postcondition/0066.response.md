Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. If the counts do not match, the loop continues without modifying `found`.***
