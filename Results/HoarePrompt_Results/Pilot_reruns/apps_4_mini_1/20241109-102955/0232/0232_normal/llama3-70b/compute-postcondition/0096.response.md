Postcondition: ***`found` is True if the counts of values in `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts`, and we break out of the inner loop. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n` and `j` is `i + 1`, `color` is the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts do not match, the state of `found` remains unchanged and the program continues without breaking the loop.***
