According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition that all counts in `current_counts` for each color in `desired_counts` must be greater than or equal to the corresponding counts in `desired_counts`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `current_counts[colors[right]]` is equal to `desired_counts[colors[right]]`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `current_counts` for the color at index `right` must be greater than `desired_counts` for that color. 

Since `current_counts[colors[right]]` is equal to `desired_counts[colors[right]]`, we need to adjust it so that `current_counts[colors[right]]` is greater than `desired_counts[colors[right]]`. No other states need to be adjusted since the condition for the loop depends only on the counts of the current color.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is greater than `desired_counts[colors[right]]`**
