The variable `right` has a value of 0, and `current_counts` is an array or dictionary that is indexed by `colors[right]`. The expression `current_counts[colors[right]] += 1` increments the count at the index corresponding to `colors[right]`. Since the exact value of `colors[right]` is not specified, we will note that the count at that specific index is increased by 1. The value of `n` and `right` do not change, but `current_counts` is modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is increased by 1**.
