The `current_counts` variable is initialized as a `defaultdict` of type `int`. This means that it will automatically assign a default value of `0` to any key that does not already exist in the dictionary. The previous states of the affected variables are not modified by this line of code; they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the addition of the empty `current_counts` dictionary ready to be populated later.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑ `k[i]` ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, and `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int)**.
