Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is increased by 1. If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If not all colors have matched counts, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None).***
