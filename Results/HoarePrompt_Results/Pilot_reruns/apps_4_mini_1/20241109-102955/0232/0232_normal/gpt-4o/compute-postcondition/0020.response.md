Output State: **If there exists a subarray in `colors` where all colors in `desired_counts` have their corresponding counts in `current_counts` equal to the desired counts, the function will return 'YES'. After the loop executes, `left` will be incremented accordingly, and `current_counts` will reflect the counts of colors processed. If the loop does not start (e.g., if `n` is 0 or the initial conditions of `current_counts` do not meet the requirements of `desired_counts`), then `current_counts` remains unchanged, `left` stays at 0, and the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None).**
