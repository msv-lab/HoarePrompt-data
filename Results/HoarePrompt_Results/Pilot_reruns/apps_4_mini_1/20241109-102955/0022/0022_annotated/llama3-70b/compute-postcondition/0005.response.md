The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
