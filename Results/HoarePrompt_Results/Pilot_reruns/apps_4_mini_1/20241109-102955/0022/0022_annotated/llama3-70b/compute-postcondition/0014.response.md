Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is greater than 2 * (current value of `i + 1), `is_palindrome` remains the same, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, the value of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, continuing the palindrome check.***
