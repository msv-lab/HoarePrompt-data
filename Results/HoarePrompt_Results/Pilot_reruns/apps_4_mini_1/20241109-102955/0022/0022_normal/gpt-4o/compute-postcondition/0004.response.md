According to the code, the loop will continue to execute while `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment. After the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `n` does not change, and since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again.

State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
