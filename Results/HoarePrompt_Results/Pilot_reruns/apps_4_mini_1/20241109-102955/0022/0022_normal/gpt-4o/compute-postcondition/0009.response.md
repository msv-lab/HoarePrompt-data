Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning any value, meaning the characters at those indices are equal.***
