Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If they are equal, the function does not return anything, allowing for further execution beyond this point.***
