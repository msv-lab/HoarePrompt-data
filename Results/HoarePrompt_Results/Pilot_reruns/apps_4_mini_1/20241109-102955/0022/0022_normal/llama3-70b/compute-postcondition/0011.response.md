According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `s`, which is not modified within the loop. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be updated to 2.

Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, and we only modify `i`, the other variables remain the same.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2**
