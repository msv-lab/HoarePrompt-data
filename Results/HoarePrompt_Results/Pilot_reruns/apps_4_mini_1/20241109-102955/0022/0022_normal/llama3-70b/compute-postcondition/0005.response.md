The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `is_spalindrome` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
