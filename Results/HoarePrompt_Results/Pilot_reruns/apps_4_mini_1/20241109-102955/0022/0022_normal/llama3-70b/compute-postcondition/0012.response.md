The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, the output states of the variables are `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `is_spalindrome` is False**
