Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `is_spalindrome` is False. If the length of `s` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `s` has an even or odd length greater than 1, the loop will execute up to `n // 2` times, comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If any pair of characters does not match, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If all pairs match, `is_spalindrome` remains True after the loop completes.**
