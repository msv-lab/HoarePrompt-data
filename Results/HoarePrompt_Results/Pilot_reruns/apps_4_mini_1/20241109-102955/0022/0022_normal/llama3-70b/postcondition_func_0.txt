The function does not accept any parameters and reads a string input from the user. It checks whether the input string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome or 'NIE' if it is not. The function handles strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, correctly identifying single-character strings as palindromes.
