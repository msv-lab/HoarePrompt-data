To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program in relation to the described requirements.

The problem states that there are three groups of voters: those who upvote (`x`), those who downvote (`y`), and those whose voting intention is unknown (`z`). The program needs to evaluate the voting situation and output one of the following:

- "+" if the upvotes are definitively greater than downvotes,
- "-" if downvotes are definitively greater than upvotes,
- "0" if they are exactly equal,
- "?" if there is uncertainty due to the unknown voters.

Now let's break down the program:

```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
min_upvotes = x
max_upvotes = x + z
min_downvotes = y
max_downvotes = y + z
if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
    print('-')
elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
    print('+')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Analysis of Potential Cases:

1. **Case 1: x = 3, y = 7, z = 0**
   - min_upvotes = 3, max_upvotes = 3, min_downvotes = 7, max_downvotes = 7
   - Since max_upvotes < min_downvotes (3 < 7), output should be "-"
   - Correct behavior.

2. **Case 2: x = 2, y = 0, z = 1**
   - min_upvotes = 2, max_upvotes = 3, min_downvotes = 0, max_downvotes = 1
   - Since max_downvotes < min_upvotes (1 < 2), output should be "+"
   - Correct behavior.

3. **Case 3: x = 1, y = 1, z = 0**
   - min_upvotes = 1, max_upvotes = 1, min_downvotes = 1, max_downvotes = 1
   - Since min_upvotes == min_downvotes (1 == 1), output should be "0"
   - Correct behavior.

4. **Case 4: x = 0, y = 0, z = 1**
   - min_upvotes = 0, max_upvotes = 1, min_downvotes = 0, max_downvotes = 1
   - Here, we see uncertainty because upvotes could be 1 or 0 and downvotes could also be 1 or 0, leading to two different results ("+" or "-"). Therefore, output should be "?".
   - Correct behavior.

### Edge Cases:
Consider the edge case where `x = 0`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`:
- min_upvotes = 0, max_upvotes = 1, min_downvotes = 1, max_downvotes = 2
- Here, max_upvotes (1) is not less than min_downvotes (1), and max_downvotes (2) is not less than min_upvotes (0).
- The program would output "?" here, which is correct since there is uncertainty.

After checking multiple cases, including edge cases, the program seems to handle all situations correctly according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program behaves as expected for all provided and potential edge cases, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
