The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on the internal values of non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained to be between 0 and 100. The function's behavior and return value are not specified in the provided output. Therefore, without additional context on the output, the functionality of the function cannot be clearly defined.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates on non-negative integers x, y, and z, constrained to the range of 0 to 100. The return value is unspecified based on the given output.**
