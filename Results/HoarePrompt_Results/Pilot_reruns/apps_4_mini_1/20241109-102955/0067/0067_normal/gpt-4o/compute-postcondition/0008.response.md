Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers within the range 0 to 100. `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is `y + z`. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+'; otherwise, the output is '?'. This handles the case when `max_downvotes` equals `min_upvotes` as well.***
