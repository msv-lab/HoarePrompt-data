The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The previous values of `y` and `z` are both non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 100. However, the exact values of `y` and `z` are not specified. Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be the sum of whatever values `y` and `z` hold within their respective ranges.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `y` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `z` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is `y`; `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
