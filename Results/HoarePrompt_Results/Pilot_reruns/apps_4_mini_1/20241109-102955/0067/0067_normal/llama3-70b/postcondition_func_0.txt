The function accepts three integer inputs x, y, and z, each in the range of 0 to 100. It prints '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, prints '-' if x is less than y, prints '0' if x equals y and z is 0, prints '?' if x equals y and z is greater than 0, and prints '?' if x is greater than y but not greater than y + z. If none of these conditions are met, it also defaults to printing '?'. There is no explicit return value from the function.
