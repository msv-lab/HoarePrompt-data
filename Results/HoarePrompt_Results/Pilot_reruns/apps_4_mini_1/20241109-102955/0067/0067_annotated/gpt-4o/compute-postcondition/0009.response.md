Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers. If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which is `y` + `z`), the program prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), the program prints '+'. In all other cases, including when `max_upvotes` is equal to or greater than `min_downvotes` and when `max_downvotes` is equal to or greater than `min_upvotes`, the program prints '?'.***
