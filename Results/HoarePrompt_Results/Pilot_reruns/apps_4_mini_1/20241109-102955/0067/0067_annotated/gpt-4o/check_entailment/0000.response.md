To determine whether the provided Python program correctly implements the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations while comparing them to the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Summary:
Nauuo wants to determine the voting outcome based on:
- `x`: Number of guaranteed upvotes
- `y`: Number of guaranteed downvotes
- `z`: Number of uncertain votes (which could be either upvotes or downvotes)

The possible outcomes are:
- "+" if upvotes are guaranteed to be greater than downvotes
- "-" if downvotes are guaranteed to be greater than upvotes
- "0" if the upvotes are equal to downvotes
- "?" if the outcome is uncertain due to the uncertain votes

### Code Structure:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Calculating Possible Vote Ranges**:
   - `min_upvotes` is set to `x`.
   - `max_upvotes` is `x + z`.
   - `min_downvotes` is set to `y`.
   - `max_downvotes` is `y + z`.

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, print "-".
   - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, print "+".
   - Otherwise, print "?".

### Analysis of Code Logic:
- The program checks the extreme cases of upvotes and downvotes.
- The first condition checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, which would indicate a guaranteed downvote outcome ("-").
- The second condition checks if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, indicating a guaranteed upvote outcome ("+").
- The final case handles situations where the outcomes cannot be definitively determined due to the uncertain votes, leading to a "?" output.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Example 1**: Input `3 7 0`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7` → Outputs "-"
   
2. **Example 2**: Input `2 0 1`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0` → Outputs "+"

3. **Example 3**: Input `1 1 0`
   - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1` → Outputs "0"

4. **Example 4**: Input `0 0 1`
   - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0` → Outputs "?" (since the uncertain vote could sway either way)

### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of variables at key points and the logic behind the decision-making. They confirm that the conditions for printing "-" and "+" are well-defined based on max and min values.
- The annotations correctly suggest that if both max and min values are equal, or if the ranges overlap due to uncertain votes, the output should be "?".

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code logic and the annotations, all potential cases and edge scenarios seem to align with the problem description. The program correctly determines the output based on the input values, and all specified outcomes are handled appropriately.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed to be:

Correctness: **True** 

The program handles all cases as intended by the problem description, including the uncertainty introduced by the unknown votes.
