Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'. This means that if `y + z < x`, the output is '+', and for all other cases (including when `y + z` is equal to or greater than `x`), the output is '?'.***
