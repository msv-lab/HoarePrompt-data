The code `print('+')` outputs the string `'+'` to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. The variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unaffected and retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**.
