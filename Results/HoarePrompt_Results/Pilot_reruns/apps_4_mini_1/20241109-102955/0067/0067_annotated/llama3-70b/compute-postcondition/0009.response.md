Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, the output is '0' if `z` is 0, otherwise '?'. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, but not greater than `y + z`, the output is '?' regardless of the values of `y` and `z`.***
