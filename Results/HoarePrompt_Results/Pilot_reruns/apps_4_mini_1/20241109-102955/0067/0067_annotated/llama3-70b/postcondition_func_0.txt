The function accepts no parameters and reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, which must be in the range of 0 to 100. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but not greater than `y + z`, and '?' if `x` is not equal to `y`. Thus, the function produces various outputs based on the comparisons of these three integers.
