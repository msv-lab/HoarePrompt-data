The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). It also accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on them. 

However, since the output specification is missing in your prompt, I cannot provide the exact return values without additional information. Please provide the output details for me to complete the functionality description.
