The code calculates the absolute distance between 0 and `max_pos`. The value of `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is a positive integer ranging from 2 to 100, and `max_pos` is defined as an index, it has a non-negative value. The value of `dist1` will thus be equal to `max_pos`, as `abs(0 - max_pos)` simplifies to `max_pos`. Other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the calculated `dist1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`.**
