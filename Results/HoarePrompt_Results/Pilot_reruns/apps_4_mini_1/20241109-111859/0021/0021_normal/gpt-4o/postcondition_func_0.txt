The function accepts no parameters directly but reads an integer `n` from input (where \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)) and then reads a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from input that must contain all integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list `a` to either end of the list (index 0 or index `n-1`). The function then prints this maximum distance. It does not return any value, only prints the result.
