The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the integer conversion of input values split by spaces. The input will be a series of distinct integers from 1 to n, where n is within the range 2 to 100. Since `a` is now assigned these integers, the previous state of `a` as an empty list or unassigned is overridden. The other variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `a` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input**
