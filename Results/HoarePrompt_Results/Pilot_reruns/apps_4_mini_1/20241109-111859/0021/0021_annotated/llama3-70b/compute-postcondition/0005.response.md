The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of the minimum between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The values of `pos1` and `posn` are determined by the positions of `1` and `n` in the list `a`, and `n` is constrained between 2 and 100. The variable `max_dist` has already been calculated and is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation for `min_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in list `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
