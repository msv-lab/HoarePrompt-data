The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Therefore, after execution, `n` will hold a new integer value that still satisfies the constraint. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 (new integer value), `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n**
