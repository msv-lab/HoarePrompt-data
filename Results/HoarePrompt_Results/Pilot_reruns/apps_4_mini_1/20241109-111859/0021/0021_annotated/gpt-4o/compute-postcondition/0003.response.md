The code assigns the value of `max_pos` to the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. The specific values of `a` and `n` are not provided, but we know that `n` must exist in the list `a` since we are calling `a.index(n)`. Therefore, `max_pos` will be assigned a valid index of `n` within `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`**
