The `dist3` variable is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`. However, the value of `min_pos` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains unknown. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, and `dist2`) are unaffected by this assignment. The output state includes all previously defined variables and their values, along with the description of the new variable `dist3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); dist3 is abs(0 - min_pos)**
