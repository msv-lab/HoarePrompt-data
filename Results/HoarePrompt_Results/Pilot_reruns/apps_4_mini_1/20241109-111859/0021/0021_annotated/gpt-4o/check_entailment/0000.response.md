To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the program's logic and the examples given in the problem statement.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n after performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the list.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly takes an integer n and a list of n distinct integers representing a permutation.
  
2. **Finding Positions**: 
   - `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1`.
   - `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n`.

3. **Calculating Distances**: 
   - `dist1` calculates the distance if `n` is swapped with the first element (index 0).
   - `dist2` calculates the distance if `n` is swapped with the last element (index n-1).
   - `dist3` calculates the distance if `1` is swapped with the first element (index 0).
   - `dist4` calculates the distance if `1` is swapped with the last element (index n-1).

4. **Determining Maximum Distance**: The program takes the maximum of the four calculated distances and prints it.

### Edge Case Consideration:
For the program to be correct according to the problem description, it must handle all possible configurations of the input correctly.

#### Example Analysis:
- For the input `5\n4 5 1 3 2`, the output is correctly `3`, as swapping `1` and `2` gives the maximum distance.
- For the input `7\n1 6 5 3 4 7 2`, the output is correctly `6`, achieved by swapping `7` and `2`.
- For the input `6\n6 5 4 3 2 1`, the output is correctly `5`, as the elements are already in the farthest possible positions.

### Missing Logic:
The program must also account for scenarios where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the extremes of the list (positions 0 and n-1). The code does not need to actually perform the swap but must correctly compute the maximum distance possible after a swap.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code against the problem description and the examples provided, I do not find any edge cases that the code fails to handle. All the scenarios described in the examples are correctly addressed by the logic in the code.

Thus, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True** 

The program effectively calculates the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap, adhering to the problem description and handling all described cases correctly.
