Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6; and the function returns a sorted list of `divisors` in descending order.**
