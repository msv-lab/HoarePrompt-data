Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is a perfect square, the loop will add the divisor `i` only once, because `i` and `x // i` will be the same.**
