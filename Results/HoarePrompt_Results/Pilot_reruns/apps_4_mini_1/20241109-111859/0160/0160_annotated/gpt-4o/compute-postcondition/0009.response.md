According to the code, the loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, which means it has just exceeded `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

To allow for one more iteration, `i` needs to be adjusted back to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. The value of `x` does not need to change, as it remains constant in this context. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be set to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)), and `divisors` are unchanged.**
