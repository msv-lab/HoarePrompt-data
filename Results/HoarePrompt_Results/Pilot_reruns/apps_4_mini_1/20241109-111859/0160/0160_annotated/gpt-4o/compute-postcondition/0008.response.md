Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `i` is calculated as int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, and if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` includes both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the contents of `divisors` remain unchanged.***
