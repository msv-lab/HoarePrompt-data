The function accepts an integer `x` and computes all unique divisors of `x`, returning them as a sorted list in reverse order. If `x` is less than 1 or greater than 10^6, the function will return an empty list, as no divisors will be computed. The function does not handle negative values or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unintended behavior.
