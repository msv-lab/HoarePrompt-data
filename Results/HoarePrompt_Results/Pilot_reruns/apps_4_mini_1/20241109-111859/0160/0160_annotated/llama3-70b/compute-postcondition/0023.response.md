The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`, which is 3. Since `max_divisor` can either be unchanged or updated, the final value of `max_divisor` will be either its previous value (if it was greater than or equal to 3) or 3 (if it was less than 3). The value of `gcd` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is at least 9, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is either unchanged or updated to 3.

Output State: **`gcd` is at least 9, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is either unchanged or updated to 3**
