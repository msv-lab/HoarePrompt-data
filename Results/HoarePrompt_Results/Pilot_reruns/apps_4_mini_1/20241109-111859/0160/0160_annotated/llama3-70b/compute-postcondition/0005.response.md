According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, the loop can execute again if `i` becomes 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2 while the other states remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is the gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`, `i` is 2**
