The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `max_divisor` is initially assigned the value of `gcd`, which is at least 1, and `i` is 1, the calculation will compare `max_divisor` (which is at least 1) and `i` (which is 1). The maximum will be either the current value of `max_divisor` or 1.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_divisor` remains at least 1, since the maximum of any value that is at least 1 and 1 will still be at least 1.

Output State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is at least 1**
