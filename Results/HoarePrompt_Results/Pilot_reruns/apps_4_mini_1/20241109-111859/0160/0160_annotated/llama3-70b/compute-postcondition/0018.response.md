The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `max_divisor` will either remain the same if it is greater than or equal to 2 or be updated to 2 if it is less than 2. The value of `gcd` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential new value of `max_divisor` based on its comparison with `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `max_divisor` is either unchanged or updated to 2**
