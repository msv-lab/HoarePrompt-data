To determine the output state, we analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
   - `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8).
   - `multiplier` is calculated as \(10^k\).
   - `x` is calculated as \( n \times \left(\frac{multiplier}{\text{math.gcd}(n, multiplier)}\right) \).

2. **Execution of the Return Statement**:
   - The return statement indicates that the function is returning the value of `x`.
   - The calculation of `x` has been based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `multiplier`, which are already set in the initial state.

3. **Impact of the Return Statement**:
   - The state of the variables `n`, `k`, `multiplier`, and `x` remains unchanged after the return statement. We simply return the computed value of `x`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of all relevant variables, including the returned value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), `multiplier` is \(10^k\), and the function returns \(x = n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{math.gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right)\)**.
