The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and \(10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained between 0 and 8. The function calculates a value \(x\) using the formula \(x = n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{math.gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right)\), where `multiplier` is defined as \(10^k\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the product of `n` and the ratio of `10^k` to the greatest common divisor of `n` and `10^k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns the product of `n` and \(\frac{10^k}{\text{math.gcd}(n, 10^k)}\).**
