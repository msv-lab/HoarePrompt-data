The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It computes a value `x` as the product of `n` and the ratio of \(10^k\) to the greatest common divisor of `n` and \(10^k\). The function returns this computed value `x`, which ensures that `x` is a multiple of `n` and divisible by \(10^k\).
