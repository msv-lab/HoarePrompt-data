The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 1. After the increment, `n` becomes a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 2. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 2; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k` and `n + 1 % x != 0**
