The value of `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, the resulting value of `x` can be calculated as `10 ** k`. The previous values of `n` and `k` do not affect the calculation of `x`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assigned value of `x` based on the input value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
