`n` is incremented by 1, changing its value from a positive integer (within the specified range) to the next positive integer. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged, and since it's given that `n % x != 0`, this condition still holds true after the increment. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 1 increased by 1; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k` and `n % x != 0`**
