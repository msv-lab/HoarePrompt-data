The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), and `k` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq k \leq 8 \). The function computes a `multiplier` based on the value of `k`, which can be one of the following values: 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The function returns a value `x`, which is derived from these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, computes a multiplier based on `k`, and returns a value `x`.**
