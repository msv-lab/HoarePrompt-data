The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer), and modifies `n` by incrementing it until it becomes divisible by `10^k`. It then prints the resulting value of `n`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original `n` that is divisible by `10^k`. If `n` is initially divisible by `10^k`, it remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.
