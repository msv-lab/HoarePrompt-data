According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the condition `n % x != 0` holds true. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is a new positive integer that has been incremented by 2, and it is currently not divisible by `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still not be divisible by `x`. 

Since `n` is not divisible by `x` at the end of the last iteration, no adjustments are needed to `n`. However, there are no guarantees that `n` will not become divisible by `x` in the next iteration. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `n` continues to be not divisible by `x`. 

State: **`n` is a new positive integer incremented by 2 and `n` is not divisible by `x`**
