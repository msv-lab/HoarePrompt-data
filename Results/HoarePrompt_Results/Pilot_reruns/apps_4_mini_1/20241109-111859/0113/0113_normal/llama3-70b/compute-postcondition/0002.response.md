The value of `n` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `n` is unknown as it is stated to be a new positive integer. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a new positive integer incremented by 1; `k` is a new non-negative integer; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer incremented by 1; `k` is a new non-negative integer; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
