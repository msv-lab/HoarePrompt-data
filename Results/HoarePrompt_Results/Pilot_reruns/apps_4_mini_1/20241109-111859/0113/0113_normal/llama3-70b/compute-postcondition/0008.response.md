Output State: **if n is not divisible by x, then n will be incremented until it becomes divisible by x; at the end, n will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original value of n that is divisible by x. If n is initially divisible by x, the loop does not execute, and n remains unchanged. k remains a new non-negative integer, and x is 10 raised to the power of k.**
