Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and returns its English word representation. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `n` is 10, it returns 'ten'. For numbers between 20 and 99, it returns the word from the `tens` list followed by a hyphen and the word from the `ones` list if `n` is not a multiple of 10. The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0 correctly in the `else` block, as it only returns 'zero' when explicitly checked for in the initial conditions. Additionally, the function contains potential unreachable code and does not account for the case where `n` is 0 during the `else` conditions.**
