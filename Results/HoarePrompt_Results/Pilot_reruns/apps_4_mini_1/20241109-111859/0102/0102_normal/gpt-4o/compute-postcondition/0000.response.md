The code snippet initializes a list called `ones` that contains the string representations of the integers from 0 to 9. The variable `s` is not affected by this code as it simply defines a list. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` remains unchanged, and the list `ones` is now defined.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; `ones` is ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']**
