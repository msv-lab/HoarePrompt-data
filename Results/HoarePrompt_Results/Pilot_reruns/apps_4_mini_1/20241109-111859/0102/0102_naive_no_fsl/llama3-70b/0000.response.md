Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its corresponding English word representation. It handles all cases as follows:

1. For scores from 0 to 9, it uses the `ones` list to retrieve the appropriate word directly.
2. For scores from 10 to 19, it uses the `teens` list to get the correct word.
3. For scores from 20 to 99, it uses the `tens` list to obtain the word for the tens place, and if there is a non-zero ones place, it appends the corresponding word from the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen.

The program successfully covers all potential inputs within the specified range (0 to 99) and outputs the correct English representation in lowercase letters and hyphens, as required by the problem description. No edge cases are missed, and it adheres to the output format stipulated. Therefore, the program is correct.
