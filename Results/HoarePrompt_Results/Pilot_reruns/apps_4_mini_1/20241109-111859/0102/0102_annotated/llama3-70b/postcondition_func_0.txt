The function accepts an integer input `s` between 0 and 99 (inclusive) and prints its English word representation. For values of `s` less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. For values from 10 to 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For values 20 and above, it constructs the word representation using the `tens` list and `ones` list, printing the tens part followed by the ones part if applicable (e.g., "twenty-one"). The function does not return any value, but outputs the word representation directly to the console.
