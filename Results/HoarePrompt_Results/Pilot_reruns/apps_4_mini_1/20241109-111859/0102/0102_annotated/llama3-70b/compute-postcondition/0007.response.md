Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 20, the program prints the corresponding string for `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the program prints the string representation of `s` in the format of tens and ones, where `tens[s // 10]` is printed followed by `''` if `s` is a multiple of 10, or `'-' + ones[s % 10]` if there is a non-zero remainder from the division.***
