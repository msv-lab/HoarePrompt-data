The code prints a string that represents the integer `s` in words. The variable `s` is an input integer between 0 and 99. To compute the output, the code calculates the tens and ones places of `s` as follows:

- `s // 10` gives the index for the `tens` array, which maps the tens place of the number to its word representation.
- `s % 10` gives the index for the `ones` array, which maps the ones place of the number to its word representation.

If the ones place is 0, it does not append anything after the tens place; otherwise, it appends a hyphen and the corresponding word from the `ones` array.

Thus, the output state will include the string representation of the integer `s`. 

Output State: **`s` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, and the corresponding string representation of `s` is printed**.
