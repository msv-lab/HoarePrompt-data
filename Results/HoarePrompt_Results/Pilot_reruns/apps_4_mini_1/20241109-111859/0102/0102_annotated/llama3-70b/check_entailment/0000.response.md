To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code and its annotations in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to convert an integer score `s` (where 0 ≤ s ≤ 99) into its English word representation, using lowercase letters and hyphens. The output must follow the specified format as shown in the examples.

### Annotations Overview:
1. **Ones**: The program correctly maps numbers from 0 to 9 to their word forms.
2. **Teens**: The program correctly maps numbers from 10 to 19 to their word forms.
3. **Tens**: The program correctly maps multiples of ten from 20 to 90 to their respective words.
4. The logic covers:
   - Numbers less than 10 using the `ones` list.
   - Numbers from 10 to 19 using the `teens` list.
   - Numbers from 20 to 99 using the `tens` and `ones` lists, properly formatting with hyphens when necessary.

### Verification of Edge Cases:
- **Case 0**: The program returns `''` for 0, which is incorrect since it should return `zero`.
- **Case 1**: Correctly returns `one`.
- **Case 6**: Correctly returns `six`.
- **Case 10**: Correctly returns `ten`.
- **Case 13**: Correctly returns `thirteen`.
- **Case 20**: Correctly returns `twenty`.
- **Case 21**: Correctly returns `twenty-one`.
- **Case 99**: Correctly returns `ninety-nine`.

### Conclusion:
While the code does handle most cases correctly, it fails to address the case when the input is 0. According to the problem description, the output for a score of 0 should be `zero`, but the code outputs an empty string instead.

Thus, there is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements set out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails for the input `0`, which should return `zero`, indicating that it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description. The annotations did not explicitly mention this case, leading to the conclusion that the code is incomplete.
