You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

If `s` is less than 10 or greater than 99, the function does not execute any return statement.

If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string from `tens[s // 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string from `tens[s // 10]` concatenated with a hyphen and the string from `ones[s % 10]`. If `s` is less than 10 or equal to 0, the function does not execute any return statement.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens[n - 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string from `tens[s // 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string from `tens[s // 10]` concatenated with a hyphen and the string from `ones[s % 10]`. If `s` is less than 10 or equal to 0, the function does not execute any return statement.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is a multiple of 10, it returns the string from `tens[s // 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is not a multiple of 10, it returns the string from `tens[s // 10]` concatenated with a hyphen and the string from `ones[s % 10]`. If `s` is equal to 10, the function returns 'ten'. If `s` is 0, it returns 'zero'. If `s` is less than 10 or if `s` is equal to 10, the function correctly handles these cases without any errors. However, there is an error due to the undefined variable `n` in the code, which prevents the function from executing correctly.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an integer `n` and aims to return its English word representation for numbers in the range 0 to 99. It returns 'zero' for 0, the corresponding word for numbers 1-9, 'ten' for 10, and the appropriate words for numbers 11-19. For multiples of ten in the range 20-90, it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list. For other numbers between 10 and 99 that are not multiples of ten, it returns a concatenation of the word for the tens and the word for the units with a hyphen in between. However, the function contains an error due to the use of an undefined variable `n` instead of `s`, which prevents it from executing correctly. As a result, it does not handle any cases properly and would raise a NameError instead of returning the expected string representations.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
