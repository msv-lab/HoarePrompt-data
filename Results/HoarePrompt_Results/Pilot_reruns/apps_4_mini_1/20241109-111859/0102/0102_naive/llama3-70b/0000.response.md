Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English word representation as specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program handles various cases:

1. **Input 0**: The output is `''` (empty string), which is not correct as the expected output should be `zero`.
2. **Input 1**: The output is `one`, which is correct.
3. **Input 10**: The output is `ten`, which is correct.
4. **Input 15**: The output is `fifteen`, which is correct.
5. **Input 20**: The output is `twenty`, which is correct.
6. **Input 25**: The output is `twenty-five`, which is correct.
7. **Input 30**: The output is `thirty`, which is correct.
8. **Input 99**: The output is `ninety-nine`, which is correct.

The program follows a systematic approach to convert numbers into words based on defined lists for ones, teens, and tens. The logic for handling numbers less than 10, between 10 and 19, and those 20 and above is correctly implemented, including the use of hyphens where necessary.

However, it does not account for the number 0, which should output "zero". This is a critical case that has been overlooked.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**.
