The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated from the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i` are based on the initial state, where `d_i` is `d_0` from `bus_routes[0]`, `t` is a positive integer, and `s_i` is `s_0` from `bus_routes[0]`. The calculation for `wait_time` does not affect other variables in the initial state, so they remain unchanged.

The output state will reflect the values of the unchanged variables and the computed `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is `s_0` from bus_routes[0], `d_i` is `d_0` from bus_routes[0], `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**.
