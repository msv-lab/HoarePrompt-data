Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, and `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, with `i` incremented by 1. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives. This accounts for all scenarios, including when `s_i` is less than, equal to, or greater than `t`.***
