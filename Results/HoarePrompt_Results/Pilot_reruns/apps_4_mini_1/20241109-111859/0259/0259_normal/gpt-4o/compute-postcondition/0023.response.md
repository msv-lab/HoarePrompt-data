The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, where `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is incremented, it means that the values of `s_i` and `d_i` are now taken from `bus_routes[i + 1]`. The other variables `n`, `t`, `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `s_i` and `d_i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i + 1]`, `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1**
