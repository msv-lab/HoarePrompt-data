The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it directly affects the value of `chosen_route`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `chosen_route` is now one more than `i`, but the exact value cannot be determined without knowing `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is `s_0` from bus_routes[0], `d_i` is `d_0` from bus_routes[0], `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`.**
