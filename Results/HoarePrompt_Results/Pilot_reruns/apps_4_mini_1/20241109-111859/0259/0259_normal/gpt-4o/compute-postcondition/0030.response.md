The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous values indicate that `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which confirms that `chosen_route` will be a valid index. The values of `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `min_wait_time` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i + 1]`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i + 1]`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1**
