The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `chosen_route` will be the new value of `i`, which is `1 + 1`. Therefore, `chosen_route` will be `2`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, and `wait_time`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented to 1, `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 2**.
