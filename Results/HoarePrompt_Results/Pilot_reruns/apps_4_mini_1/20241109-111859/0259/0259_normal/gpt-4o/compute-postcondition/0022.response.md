According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i` and its comparison with `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, which means that the current value of `i` is now one greater than it was at the start of the last iteration.

Since `i` has been incremented by 1 and `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).

Thus, if `n` is currently equal to or less than `i + 1`, we must adjust `n` to be greater than `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i]` with `i` incremented by 1, `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`**
