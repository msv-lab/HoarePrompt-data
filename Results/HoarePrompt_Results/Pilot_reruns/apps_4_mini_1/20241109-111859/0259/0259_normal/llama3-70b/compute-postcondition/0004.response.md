The code appends a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the `buses` list. Since `buses` is initially an empty list, after execution, it will contain one element, which is the tuple `(s, d)`. The values of `n`, `t`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that the `buses` list now contains one tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
