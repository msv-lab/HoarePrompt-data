Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `min_time` is either `infinity` or `time`, `ans` is updated to 3 if `time` is less than `min_time`. If `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `min_time` remains unchanged and `ans` stays as 2. In case `time` is equal to `min_time`, `min_time` is not updated, but `ans` remains as 2. The value of `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `(s, d)` is the third tuple in `buses`.***
