According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred. 

Given that `_` is typically initialized to 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, if `_` has reached `n-1` in the last iteration, then `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, `n` should be adjusted to at least `2`, and `_` should be adjusted to `1` (indicating that one iteration has completed).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
