Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `min_time` is either `infinity` or `time`, `ans` is updated to `i + 1` if `time` is less than `min_time`, which means `min_time` is now equal to `time` and `ans` is 2. If `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `min_time` remains unchanged and `ans` is not updated. `i` is 1, `(s, d)` is the second tuple in `buses`, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`.***
