According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, which means it can execute again. However, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider that `n` will decrease by 1 after each iteration.

To ensure that the loop can run one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 2 (because it will decrement to 1 after this iteration). There are no other states that need to be adjusted since `t` and `buses` do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d)**
