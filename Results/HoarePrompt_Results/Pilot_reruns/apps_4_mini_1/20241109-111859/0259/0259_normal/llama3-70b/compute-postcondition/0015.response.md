According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `buses`. For the loop to execute, `buses` must contain at least one tuple. The variable `i` will start at 0, and `(s, d)` will be assigned the values of the first tuple in `buses`. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `buses` has at least one tuple. The current states can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `min_time` is infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`**
