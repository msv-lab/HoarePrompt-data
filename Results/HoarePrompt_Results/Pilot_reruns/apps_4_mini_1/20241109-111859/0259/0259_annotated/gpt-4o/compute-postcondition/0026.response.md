The code calculates `wait_time` using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), and `i` is `n + 1`, `i` will be in the range (2 to 101). The specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` will depend on the data in `bus_routes`, but `s_i` and `d_i` are now both known values from `bus_routes[i]`.

Now, we compute:
- The value of `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000).
- `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, which are known values.

Then, we substitute `s_i` and `d_i` into the formula:
- The expression `(t - s_i) % d_i` calculates the remaining time after waiting for `s_i` and takes the modulus with `d_i`.

Finally, we compute `wait_time`:
- `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which gives the time until the next bus.

Given that `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, we cannot determine their specific numeric values, but we acknowledge their impact on `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n + 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
