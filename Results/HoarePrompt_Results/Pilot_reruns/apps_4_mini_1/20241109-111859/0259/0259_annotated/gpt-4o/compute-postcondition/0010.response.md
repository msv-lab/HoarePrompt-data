The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `chosen_route` will be updated to 1. The other variables (`min_wait_time` and `wait_time`) remain unchanged, and their states do not affect the outcome of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0**
