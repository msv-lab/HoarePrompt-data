The code initializes the variable `wait_time` to 0. The previous states of the affected variables are not changed, and no calculations are performed on `n`, `t`, `i`, `s_i`, or `d_i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables alongside the initialization of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n + 1, `s_i` is assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`, `d_i` is assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`, `s_i, d_i` are now assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is 0.**
