Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), each `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000) for i from 1 to n; if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, reflecting the time until the next bus arrives based on the schedules provided by `s_i` and `d_i`. In both cases, `min_wait_time` remains set to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, and `i` is 0.***
