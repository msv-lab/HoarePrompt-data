The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of -1. This does not affect any other variables, and the previous values of `n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `min_wait_time` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `chosen_route` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), each `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000) for i from 1 to n; `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity; `chosen_route` is -1**
