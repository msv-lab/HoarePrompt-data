The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is a positive integer (1 <= s_i <= 100000) assigned from `bus_routes[0]`, and `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000). Therefore, the value of `wait_time` will be the result of subtracting `t` from `s_i`. Since both `s_i` and `t` are positive integers, `wait_time` will be a positive integer, or potentially zero if `s_i` is equal to `t`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.**
