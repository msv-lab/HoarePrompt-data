The code assigns `min_wait_time` the value of `wait_time`. Since there is no information provided about the current value of `wait_time`, the output state will indicate that `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output state reflects this.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
