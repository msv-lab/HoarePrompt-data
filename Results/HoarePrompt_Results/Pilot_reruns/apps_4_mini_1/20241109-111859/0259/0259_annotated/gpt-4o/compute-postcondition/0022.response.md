According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. This means that the loop has reached its limit because the range function in Python generates numbers from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to `n + 1`, which would mean that the loop condition is not satisfied anymore. 

However, since `i` is already equal to `n`, and there are no changes to `n` noted, the only adjustment needed is to note that the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented to `n + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n + 1, `s_i` is assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`, `d_i` is assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`**
