The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `buses` containing `n` tuples of integers (s, d) and `min_time` set to infinity (float('inf')). The state of `buses` and `min_time` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` contains `n` tuples of integers (s, d); `min_time` is infinity; `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` contains `n` tuples of integers (s, d); `min_time` is infinity; `ans` is -1**
