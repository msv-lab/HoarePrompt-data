The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `t` from user input, where `n` represents the number of buses and `t` is a specific time. It then reads `n` tuples of integers `(s, d)` which represent the start time and interval of each bus, respectively. The function calculates the minimum time until a bus departs after time `t` and outputs the 1-based index of the bus that has the earliest departure time. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), the function will output `-1` as the index. 

Functionality: ** The function reads the number of buses and a time, then calculates and prints the index of the bus with the earliest departure time after that time, or -1 if no buses are provided. **
