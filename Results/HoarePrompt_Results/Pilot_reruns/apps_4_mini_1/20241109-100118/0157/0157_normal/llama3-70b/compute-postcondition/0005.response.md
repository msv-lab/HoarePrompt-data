The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The output of the function is not specified in the provided details. Therefore, without additional information on the output based on these constraints, it is not possible to describe the return value of the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraints that a, b, and c are positive integers from 1 to 1000, but the output is not defined.**
