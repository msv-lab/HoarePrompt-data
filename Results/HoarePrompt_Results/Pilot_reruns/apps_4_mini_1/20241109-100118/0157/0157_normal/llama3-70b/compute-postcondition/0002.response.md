The value of `c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The only relevant condition is that `c` is now a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000**
