To determine the output state after executing the given code, we first analyze the provided initial state:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input positive integer.
- `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

The expression for `total_fruits` is computed as follows:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

This simplifies to:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
```

Thus, `total_fruits` will be equal to `7 * max_lemons`.

Since `max_lemons` is derived from the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, it will have a specific value based on the input integers. However, we do not have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, so we express the output state in terms of these variables.

Given that `max_lemons` is affected by `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state will reflect the computed value of `total_fruits` based on `max_lemons`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input positive integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is 7 * max_lemons.**
