Let's analyze the provided program and check its correctness based on the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
Nikolay has fruits in the following quantities:
- a lemons
- b apples
- c pears

To make a compote, the fruits must be used in the ratio:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

The task is to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, pears) that can be used.

### Program:
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

### Output Hints:
- The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input.
- It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the constraints of available fruits: `a` lemons, half of `b` fruits, and a quarter of `c` fruits.
- It computes the total number of fruits produced based on the maximum number of lemons, which is calculated as `7 * max_lemons`.
- Finally, it prints the total fruits produced.

### Initial Assessment:
The code calculates `max_lemons` correctly as the minimum of:
- `a` (number of lemons),
- `b // 2` (the maximum number of lemons that can be supported by the number of apples),
- `c // 4` (the maximum number of lemons that can be supported by the number of pears).

The total number of fruits is then computed as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `7 * max_lemons`. 

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. If `a`, `b`, or `c` is 0, the output will be 0, which is correct as no compote can be made.
2. If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 4`, the output will be `7`, which is valid.
3. If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, the output will be `0`, which is also correct since there are not enough pears.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the code. They state that the function calculates the maximum number of lemons based on available fruit ratios and computes the total number of fruits correctly. The explanation agrees with the calculation logic in the code.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all edge cases as described. There are no scenarios where it fails to meet the requirements. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program accurately calculates the maximum number of total fruits that can be used based on the given constraints without missing any edge cases.
