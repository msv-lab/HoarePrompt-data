The value of `min_lemon` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which determines the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be simplified to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`. Therefore, the output state depends on the specific input values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, but we can express the final result in terms of `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the output is `min_lemon * 7`**.
