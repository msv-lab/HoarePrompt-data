Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) that can be used in the compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4. It first determines how many complete sets of fruits can be made by checking the minimum of lemons available, half the apples available (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon), and a quarter of the pears available (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon). 

The logic used in the program accurately reflects the requirements of the problem description, and it successfully handles edge cases, such as when any of the fruits are insufficient to create even a single set. For example:

1. If a = 2, b = 5, c = 7, the output is correctly calculated as 7 (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears).
2. If a = 4, b = 7, c = 13, the output is correctly calculated as 21 (3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears).
3. If a = 2, b = 3, c = 2, since there are not enough pears, the output is correctly calculated as 0.

Thus, the program meets all stated requirements and handles potential edge cases correctly.
