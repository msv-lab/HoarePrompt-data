Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0 initially. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `l % MOD` with `num` being equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, `total_sum` remains 0, and `num` is unchanged at `l`.***
