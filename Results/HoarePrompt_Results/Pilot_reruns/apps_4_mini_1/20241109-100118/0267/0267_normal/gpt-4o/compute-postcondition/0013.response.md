The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Here are the details regarding these parameters:

- `l` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq l \).
- `r` is an integer such that \( l \leq r < 10^{18} \).
- `k` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10 \).

After executing the function body, if `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns `total_sum`, which remains 0. If there are no integers in the range [l, r] for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` also remains 0, and the function returns `total_sum`. If there are integers satisfying `func_1(num, k)`, `total_sum` is the sum of those integers modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the sum of all integers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition defined by `func_1(num, k)`, or 0 if no integers satisfy the condition or if `l` is greater than `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l, r, and k, and returns the sum of all integers in the range [l, r] for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If l is greater than r or no integers satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, it returns 0.**
