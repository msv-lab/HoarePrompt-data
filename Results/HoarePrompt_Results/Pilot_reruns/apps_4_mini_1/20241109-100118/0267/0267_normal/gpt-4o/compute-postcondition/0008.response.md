To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, I first analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state:

1. The initial state indicates that `total_sum` is 0 and `num` is `l + 2`.
2. The line of code updates `total_sum` by adding the current value of `num` to it and then takes the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `MOD` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a constant.
3. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + (l + 2)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 2) % MOD`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `MOD`, and their relationship are not specified, the output state will reflect the known information and the effect of the operation.

Output State: **`l` is such that 1 <= `l` <= `r - 1, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is (l + 2) % MOD, `num` is (l + 2)**
