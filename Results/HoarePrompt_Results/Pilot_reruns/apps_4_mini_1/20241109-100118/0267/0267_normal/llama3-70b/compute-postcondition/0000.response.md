The function returns `0`, and the values of `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The return statement does not change the state of `l`, `r`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state is `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\), and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and the function returns 0**
