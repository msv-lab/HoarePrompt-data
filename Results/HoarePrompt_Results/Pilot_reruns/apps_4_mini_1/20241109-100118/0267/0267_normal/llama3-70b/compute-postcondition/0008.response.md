According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at the maximum value it can take, which is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased, which means `k` must be at least 2. Additionally, since `i` will take on the value of `k - 1` in the next iteration, we need to set `i` to `k - 1`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `k` is at least 2, and `i` will be equal to `k - 1`. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated from 9 to 9 + 9 * (10, k is at least 2, i is k - 1**
