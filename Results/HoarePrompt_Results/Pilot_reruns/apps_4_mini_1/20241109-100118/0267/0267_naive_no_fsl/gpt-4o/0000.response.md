Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for large ranges due to its linear complexity in iterating over all numbers from `l` to `r`. Given the constraints where `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), the loop in `func_2` will take an impractically long time to execute, which means it effectively cannot handle the input size specified in the problem description.

For example, if we test the program with an input like:
```
1 1000000000000000000 2
```
The program will attempt to iterate through all numbers from `1` to `10^{18}`, which is not feasible in a reasonable amount of time. 

Thus, while the logic for checking the number of different digits is correctly implemented, the performance of the program makes it incorrect as it cannot handle the input limits specified in the problem description.
