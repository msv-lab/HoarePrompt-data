The function returns `0`, and the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged as integers such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= 10`. The return statement does not alter the state of these variables, so the output state is `l` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, `r` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= 10`, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, `r` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= 10`, and the function returns 0**
