Output State: **If k is 1, then dp[n, k] is 9; if k is 2, then dp[n, k] is updated based on the expression for i = 1; if k is 3, dp[n, k] is updated for both i = 1 and i = 2; after k iterations, dp[n, k] will be the result of the cumulative updates based on the loop's formula; and dp[n, k] is taken modulo MOD.**
