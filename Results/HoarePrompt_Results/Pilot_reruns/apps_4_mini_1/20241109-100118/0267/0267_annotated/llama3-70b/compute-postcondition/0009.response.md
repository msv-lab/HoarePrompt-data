In the initial state, `dp[n, k]` is `9 * 10`, `i` is `k - 1`, and we have the expression:

```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
```

First, we substitute `i` with `k - 1` in the expression. This gives us:

```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** ((k - 1) - 1) * (10 ** (k - (k - 1)) - 10 ** ((k - 1) - 1))
```

Simplifying the expression:

- `i - 1` becomes `k - 2`
- `k - i` becomes `1`
- Thus, `10 ** (k - i)` becomes `10 ** 1`, which is `10`.
- And `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2)`.

So we can rewrite the expression as:

```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (10 - 10 ** (k - 2))
```

Next, we calculate the components:

1. `9 * 10 ** (k - 2)`: This is a value dependent on `k`.
2. `10 - 10 ** (k - 2)`: This simplifies to `10 - 10 ** (k - 2)`.

Now we can combine these to get the new value of `dp[n, k]`:

```
dp[n, k] = 9 * 10 + 9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (10 - 10 ** (k - 2))
```

The final value of `dp[n, k]` will be updated based on the above calculations. As the exact values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not provided, and since `dp[n, k]` starts at `9 * 10`, the output can only reflect the change in `dp[n, k]`.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on the expression involving `k`; new value is calculated but remains undetermined without specific `k` value**.
