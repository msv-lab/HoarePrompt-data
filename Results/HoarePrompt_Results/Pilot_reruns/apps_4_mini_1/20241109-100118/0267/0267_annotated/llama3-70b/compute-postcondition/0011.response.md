The expression updates `dp[n, k]` based on its current value and involves the calculation `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The value of `dp[n, k]` will therefore change, but the exact new value remains undetermined without a specific value for `k`. Since `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `k - i` will also be at least 1, ensuring that the operations involved in the expression are valid. The other variables `i` is 1, so it contributes to the calculation.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on the expression involving `k`; new value is calculated but remains undetermined without specific `k` value, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
