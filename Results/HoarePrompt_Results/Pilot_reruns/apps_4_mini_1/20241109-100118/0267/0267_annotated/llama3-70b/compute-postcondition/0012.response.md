According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. Since `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it is still valid for the loop to execute again.

There are no other states that need to be adjusted. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on the expression involving `k`; new value is calculated but remains undetermined without specific `k` value, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
