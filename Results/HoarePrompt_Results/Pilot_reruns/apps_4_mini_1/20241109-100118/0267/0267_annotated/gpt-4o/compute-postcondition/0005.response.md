The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l + 1`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `total_sum` will be equal to `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 1) % MOD`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_sum` is (l + 1) % MOD, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `num` is equal to l + 1**
