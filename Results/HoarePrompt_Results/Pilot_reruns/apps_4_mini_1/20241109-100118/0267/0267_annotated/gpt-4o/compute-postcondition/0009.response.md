Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is 0, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, and `num` is equal to `l + 2`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, which results in `total_sum` being equal to `(l + 2) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0.***
