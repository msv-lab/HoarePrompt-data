Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the issue arises from the use of the `range(l, r + 1)` function in `func_2`. 

The `range` function in Python does not support large integer ranges efficiently, especially given the problem constraints where both `l` and `r` can be up to `10^18`. This means that if `r - l` is large (which could be the case, for example, if `l = 1` and `r = 10^18`), the program will attempt to iterate through an enormous range of numbers, which is not feasible and could lead to performance issues or even a memory error.

Furthermore, while the function `func_1` correctly checks for the number of unique digits, the iteration over the entire range `[l, r]` means that any edge cases involving large ranges or specific combinations of `l`, `r`, and `k` will likely not be handled properly within a reasonable time frame.

For example, if we take `l = 1`, `r = 1000`, and `k = 1`, the function would attempt to sum all numbers from `1` to `1000`, which includes many numbers with different digits, ultimately leading to an incorrect sum if the range is large while the constraint of `k` is not being respected.

In conclusion, the code fails to meet the problem requirements for large ranges of `l` and `r`, leading to incorrect functionality. Thus, the correctness is false.
