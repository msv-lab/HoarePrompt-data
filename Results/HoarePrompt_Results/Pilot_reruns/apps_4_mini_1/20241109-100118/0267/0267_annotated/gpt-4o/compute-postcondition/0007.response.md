According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range defined by `l` and `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 1`. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check whether `num` is less than or equal to `r`. Since `num` is currently `l + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `l + 1` must be less than or equal to `r`. This means `r` must be at least `l + 1`, which is already satisfied if `l ≤ r`.

If the loop is to execute one more time, `num` should be incremented to `num + 1`, which means it will be equal to `l + 2` in the next iteration. 

Therefore, the necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `num` should be updated to `l + 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `total_sum` was already 0 at the start, and will remain 0 unless `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true during the next iteration.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `num` is equal to `l + 2`**
