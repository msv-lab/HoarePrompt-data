The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l` and `r`, which are integers that define a range `[l, r]`, and `k`, which is an integer with a value between 1 and 10. The function calculates the sum of all integers within this range for which the helper function `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`. 

Key points to consider:
1. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop will not execute, and `total_sum` will remain 0, returning 0 in this case.
2. If `l` is equal to `r` and `func_1(l, k)` returns `False`, `total_sum` will also remain 0.
3. The result is computed as the sum of the selected integers modulo `MOD`, which is not defined in the provided code but is assumed to be a constant in the context of the function.

Overall, the function sums the integers in the specified range based on the condition evaluated by `func_1`, returning the calculated `total_sum`. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (with 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18) and an integer `k` (with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10). It returns the sum of all integers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`. If `l` is greater than `r`, it returns 0. **
