The variable `res` is assigned the value `res += char`, which means that the current value of `res`, which is 'aa', will have `char`, which is 'a', appended to it. Therefore, `res` becomes 'aaa'. The values of `s` and `char` are not affected, so the output state includes the updated value of `res`.

Output State: **`s` has at least one 'a', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'**
