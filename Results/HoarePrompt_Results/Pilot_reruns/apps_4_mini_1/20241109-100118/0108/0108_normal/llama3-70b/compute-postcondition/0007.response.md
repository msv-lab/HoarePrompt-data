The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. Initially, `res` is 'a' and `char` is also 'a', so after the execution of `res += char`, the new value of `res` becomes 'aa'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one occurrence of 'a', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of 'a', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
