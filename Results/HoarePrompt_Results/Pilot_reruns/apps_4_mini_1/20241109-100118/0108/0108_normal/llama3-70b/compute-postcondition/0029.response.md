The variable `res` is updated to include `char`, which means that `char` is appended to the end of the current value of `res`. The variable `s` is updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the next character, but the previous state of `s` is not provided. Since `char` is still in `s`, it indicates that the first occurrence was replaced, but other occurrences may still exist. The value of `res` is now modified by adding `char` to it, while the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, `s` is updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the next character, and `char` is still in `s`.**
