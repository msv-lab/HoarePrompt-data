The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the next character in the ASCII table. The updated string `s` will reflect this change, while `char` remains unchanged as it still exists in the updated `s`. The variable `res` is not affected directly by this operation, but it's noted that it was previously updated to include `char`.

Therefore, after executing the line of code, the output state will reflect the new value of `s` after the replacement and confirm that `char` is still present in `s`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, `s` is updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the next character, and `char` is still in `s`.**
