The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is less than 26, its new value will be `j + 1`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is now j + 1.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is now j + 1**
