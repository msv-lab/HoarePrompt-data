The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is less than 26.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is less than 26**
