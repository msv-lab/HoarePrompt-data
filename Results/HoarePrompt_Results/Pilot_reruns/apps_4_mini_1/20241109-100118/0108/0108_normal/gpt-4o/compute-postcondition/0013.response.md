Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; if the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `j` of `target`, `j` remains unchanged. Additionally, `j` must be less than 26 to ensure it does not exceed the length of `target`.***
