Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if `s` contains all the letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. If it does, it prints the entire alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` is empty or does not start with 'a', it will also print -1.**
