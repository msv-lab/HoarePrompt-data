The variable `s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of the character `char` (which is 'a') with the character that follows it in the ASCII table. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, and the character following it is 'b', which has an ASCII value of 98. Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of 'b', the first 'a' in `s` will be replaced by 'b'. The values of `res` and `char` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is modified to remove the first occurrence of 'a' and replace it with 'b'; `res` is a string of 'a's followed by 'aa'; `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is modified to include 'b' instead of the first 'a'; `res` is a string of 'a's followed by 'aa'; `char` is 'a'**
