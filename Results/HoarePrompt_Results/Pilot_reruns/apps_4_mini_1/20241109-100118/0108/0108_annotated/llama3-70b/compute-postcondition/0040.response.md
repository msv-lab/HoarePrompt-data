Postcondition: ***`res` is a string composed of letters from `s` sorted in alphabetical order, with each letter repeated according to its occurrences in `s`. If `res` contains exactly 26 characters, it is printed. If `res` does not contain 26 characters (indicating that `s` was empty, contained letters not in the alphabet, or did not include all letters from 'a' to 'z'), the function prints -1, and `s` remains unchanged.***
