According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next ASCII character. This means that if `char` was present in `s` before the replacement, it has now been replaced, and therefore, it may not be present in `s` anymore.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `s` such that `char` is still present in it. This can be achieved by ensuring that `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char` before the replacement. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `s` must still contain `char`.

State: **`res` is 'b' followed by 'a's repeated `n-1` times plus `char`, `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`**
