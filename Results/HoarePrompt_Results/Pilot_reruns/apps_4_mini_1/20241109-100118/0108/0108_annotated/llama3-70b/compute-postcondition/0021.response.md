The variable `res` is modified by appending `char`, which is 'a'. The previous value of `res` is a string of 'a's followed by 'aa'. Therefore, after execution, `res` will contain the original string plus an additional 'a'. The value of `s` and `char` are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is modified to include 'a' again; `res` is a string of 'a's followed by 'aaa'; `char` is 'a'**
