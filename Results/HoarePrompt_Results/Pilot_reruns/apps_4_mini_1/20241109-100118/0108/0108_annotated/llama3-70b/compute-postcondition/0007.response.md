The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. Initially, `res` is 'a' and `char` is also 'a', so after execution, `res` becomes 'aa'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a', and `s` contains 'a'.

Output State: **`alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a', and `s` contains 'a'**
