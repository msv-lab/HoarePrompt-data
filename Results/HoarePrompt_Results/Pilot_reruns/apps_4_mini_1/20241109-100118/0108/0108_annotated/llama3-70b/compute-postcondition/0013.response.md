Output State: **If `s` contains at least one occurrence of 'a', the loop will execute multiple times, appending 'a' to `res` each time and replacing the first occurrence of 'a' with the next letter in the alphabet until there are no occurrences of 'a' left in `s`. At the end of the loop, `res` will be a string of 'a's equal to the number of times 'a' was replaced in `s`, `char` will be 'a', and `s` will have no occurrences of 'a'. If `s` does not contain 'a' at the start, the loop will not execute, leaving `res` as an empty string and `s` unchanged.**
