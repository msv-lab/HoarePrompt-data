Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `target_len` is greater than 1. If the character at position `i` of `s` is equal to the character at position `j` of `target`, then `j` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `j` remains unchanged.***
