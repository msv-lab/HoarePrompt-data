The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`, where `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The length of this string is 26, so `target_len` will be 26. The other variable `s` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26**
