Output State: **`if s is an empty string then i is 0 and j is 0. If s contains at least one character and does not contain all characters of target, loop will execute until either i reaches len(s) or j reaches 26, with i being equal to len(s) and j reflecting the number of matched characters from target. If s contains all characters from target, then i equals len(s) and j equals 26; the function prints target.**
