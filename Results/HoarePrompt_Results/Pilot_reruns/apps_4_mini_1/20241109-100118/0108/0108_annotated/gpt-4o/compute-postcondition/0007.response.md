According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `s`, and `j`. The loop will execute again if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, and `j` remains 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(s)` and that `j` is less than `target_len`.

1. Since `i` has been increased by 1, it must be adjusted to ensure it remains less than `len(s)`. This means `len(s)` must be greater than `i`.
2. The variable `j` must also satisfy the condition `j < target_len`, meaning `target_len` must be greater than 1 (since `j` is currently 1).

We do not have explicit values for `len(s)` or `target_len` from the provided state, so we can state the necessary conditions without specific values.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input, `i` is increased by 1, `j` remains 1, and len(s) is greater than i, and target_len is greater than 1**
