Postcondition: ***If `j` equals `target_len`, the function prints `target`. If `j` does not equal `target_len`, the function prints -1. The variable `j` reflects the number of matched characters from `target`, which could be 0 if `s` is an empty string, or could be between 1 and 26 if `s` contains some characters but not all from `target`. If `s` contains all characters from `target`, `j` equals 26. Thus, the function's output depends on whether all characters from `target` are matched.***
