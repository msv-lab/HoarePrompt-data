According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, and `target_len`. The loop can execute again if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, so we must ensure that `i` is still less than `len(s)` and that `j` is less than `target_len`. The condition `len(s)` must be greater than `i`, and `target_len` must remain greater than 1.

If `i` was increased by 1 during the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is at least `i + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `len(s)` to be greater than `i`. Additionally, we must ensure that `target_len` is greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `target_len` is greater than 1**
