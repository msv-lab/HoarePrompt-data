The value of `j` is incremented by 1, while the values of `s`, `i`, and the conditions regarding `len(s)` and `target_len` are unchanged. Since `j` was previously 1, after executing `j += 1`, `j` becomes 2. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 2, and `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `target_len` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 2, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `target_len` is greater than 1**
