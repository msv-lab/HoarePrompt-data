The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, `target_len` is greater than 1, and variable `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, `target_len` is greater than 1, and variable `j` is increased by 1**
