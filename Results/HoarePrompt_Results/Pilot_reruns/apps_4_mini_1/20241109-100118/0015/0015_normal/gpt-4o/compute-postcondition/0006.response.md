Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not zero and `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c` and non-negative. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either `c` is zero, the difference is not a multiple of `c`, or the result of `(b - a) / c` is negative.***
