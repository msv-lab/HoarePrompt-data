Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and non-negative. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not divisible by `c` or is negative. This covers cases where `c` is positive, zero (resulting in division by zero and an automatic 'NO'), or negative, along with the various possible relationships between `a` and `b`.***
