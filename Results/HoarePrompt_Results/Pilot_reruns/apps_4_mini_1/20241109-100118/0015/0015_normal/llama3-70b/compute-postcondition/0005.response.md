The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the values of the variables and the printed output. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and 'NO' is printed**
