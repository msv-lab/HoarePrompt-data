Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether the integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and a common difference `c`. 

Here's why it works:

1. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, then `b` is indeed in the sequence (which consists of only the element `a`), and it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

2. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` (i.e., `(b - a) % c == 0`). This ensures that `b` could be reached by moving from `a` in steps of `c`. Additionally, it checks if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, which ensures that `b` is greater than or equal to `a` when `c` is positive, or that `b` is less than or equal to `a` when `c` is negative.

The program covers all relevant edge cases and adheres to the problem description. No counterexamples can be found that would indicate failure for any valid inputs within the given constraints.
