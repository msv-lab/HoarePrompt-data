To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

The sequence is defined such that:
- The first element is `a`.
- Each subsequent element is derived by adding a constant `c`.

We are required to decide if the integer `b` appears in this sequence.

The program includes the following checks:
1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it directly returns "YES".
2. If `c` is `0`, it checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If so, it returns "YES", because the sequence would be constant (all elements equal to `a`). If not, it returns "NO".
3. If `c` is not `0`, it checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` (which checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` multiple times) and whether `(b - a) / c >= 0` (which ensures that we are moving forward in the sequence).

Now, letâ€™s consider edge cases that might not be handled correctly:

### Edge Case 1:
If `c` is negative and `b` is greater than `a`, the program will return "NO" because `(b - a) / c` will be a negative number, which means that we cannot reach `b` by moving backwards from `a` (since `c` is negative).

For example:
- Input: `a = 5`, `b = 10`, `c = -2`
- Expected output: "NO" (since the sequence would be 5, 3, 1, ... and would never reach 10)
- Actual output: "NO" (correct in this case).

### Edge Case 2:
If `c` is positive and `b` is less than `a`, the program will check if `(b - a) / c >= 0`. This will be false and should return "NO", which is the expected behavior.

For example:
- Input: `a = 5`, `b = 2`, `c = 2`
- Expected output: "NO" (since the sequence would be 5, 7, 9, ...)
- Actual output: "NO" (correct in this case).

### Edge Case 3:
If `c` is `0` and `a` is different from `b`, the program correctly returns "NO".

For example:
- Input: `a = 5`, `b = 3`, `c = 0`
- Expected output: "NO"
- Actual output: "NO" (correct in this case).

### Summary:
The program logic correctly checks if `b` can be reached from `a` given the step size `c`, and handles edge cases where `c` is `0` or negative appropriately. All conditions seem to be covered.

Therefore, I cannot find any case where the program does not perform as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
