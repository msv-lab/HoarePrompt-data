Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers assigned values from input within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This includes edge cases where `c` is zero, which results in 'NO', and where `b` is equal to `a`, which leads to 'YES' if `c` is a non-zero divisor of 0, or 'NO' otherwise.**
