Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers assigned values from input within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, the output is 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, the output is 'YES'. In all other cases, the output is 'NO', including scenarios where `c` is a non-zero divisor of the difference between `b` and `a`, leading to a positive quotient, or where none of the earlier conditions are met.***
