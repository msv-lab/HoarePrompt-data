Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the constant difference `c`.

Hereâ€™s how the program handles different scenarios:

1. **Case where b equals a**: If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints "YES", which is correct because the first element of the sequence is `a`.

2. **Case where c equals 0**: If `c` is zero, the sequence becomes constant (all elements are `a`). The program correctly checks if `b` is equal to `a` and prints "NO" if it is not, which is the expected behavior.

3. **General case**: For other cases where `c` is not zero, the program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to see if `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`. It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that `b` is reachable in the positive direction of the sequence. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program accurately addresses all potential cases described in the problem statement and matches the expected results from the examples provided. There are no edge cases where it fails to deliver the correct output. 

Thus, the program is correct, and I can confidently state that its correctness is **True**.
