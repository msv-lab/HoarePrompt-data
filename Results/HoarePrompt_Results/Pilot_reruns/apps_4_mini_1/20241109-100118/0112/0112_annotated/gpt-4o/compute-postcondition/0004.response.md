According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be within the range specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 3). This means that `n` should be at least 1 for the loop to have any iterations. The variable `i` will start from 0 and will increment with each iteration of the loop until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Given that `digit` is the first element in `digits`, it is already set up for the first iteration of the loop. The state of `found` being `False` does not affect whether the loop will execute.

To summarize, the necessary states are:
- `n` is at least 1 (to ensure the loop will execute).
- `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting index of the loop).

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop starts will be:

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in num with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is False**
