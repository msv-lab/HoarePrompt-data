The code snippet converts the variable `num` into a string, then creates a list of its digits. The value of `num` is not provided, but it is implied that it can be any integer. The variable `digits` will hold a list of string representations of each digit in `num`. The other variables (`n` and `cube_faces`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `digits` based on the value of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists; `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in num**
