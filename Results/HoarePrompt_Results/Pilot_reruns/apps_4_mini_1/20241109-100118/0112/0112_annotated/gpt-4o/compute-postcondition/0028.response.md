Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then after the loop executes, `used_cubes` will have True values for indices corresponding to the digits found in `cube_faces`, and `found` will be True for the first digit that was successfully matched. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and all values remain unchanged with `used_cubes` containing all False values and `found` being False. If any digit cannot be matched to any of the cube faces, the function returns False immediately, indicating that not all digits could be represented.**
