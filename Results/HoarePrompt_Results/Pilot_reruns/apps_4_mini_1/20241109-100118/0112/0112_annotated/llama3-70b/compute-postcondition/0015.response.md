The function `func` does not have any parameters that are explicitly passed to it. Instead, it reads input directly, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 (inclusive). For each of the next `n` lines, the function expects to read 6 integers, each representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes, where each integer is between 0 and 9. The function processes this input and produces a certain output based on the read values. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an integer `n` and subsequently read `n` lines of 6 integers each, where each integer represents cube face values. The output will depend on the logic applied to these cube face values, but specific output details are not provided in this context. 

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n (between 1 and 3 inclusive) and then reads n lines, each containing 6 integers (between 0 and 9) representing the numbers on the faces of cubes.**
