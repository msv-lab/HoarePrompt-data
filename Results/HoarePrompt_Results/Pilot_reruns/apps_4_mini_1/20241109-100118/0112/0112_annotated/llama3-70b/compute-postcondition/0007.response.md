According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` variable. If `cubes` contains at least 3 lists, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `n` is between 1 and 3, which does not directly affect the loop execution.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `cubes` must contain at least 3 lists, and `cube` must be updated to reflect the next list in `cubes`, which would be the third list. Therefore, `cube` should be updated to the third list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 3, `cubes` contains at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated with string representations of the digits in `cube`**
