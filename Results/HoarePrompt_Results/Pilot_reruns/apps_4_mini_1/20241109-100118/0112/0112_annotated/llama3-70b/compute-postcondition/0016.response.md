Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer `n` between 1 and 3, followed by `n` lines of integers representing the faces of cubes. It collects all unique digits from these integers, removes '0' if it is present, and then constructs and prints the largest possible integer that can be formed by arranging the remaining digits in descending order. If all digits are '0', the output will be 0, but if there are no digits (in case of empty input), it will raise an error. **
