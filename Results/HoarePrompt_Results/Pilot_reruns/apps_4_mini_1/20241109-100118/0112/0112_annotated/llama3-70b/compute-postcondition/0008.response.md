The `digits` variable is updated with string representations of the digits in the `cube`, which is the third list in `cubes`. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, the `cube` variable will contain a list with some elements, and `digits` will now include the string representations of each digit present in that list. The exact contents of `digits` depend on the specific contents of `cube`, but it will now reflect the updated values.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 3, `cubes` contains at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with string representations of the digits in `cube`**
