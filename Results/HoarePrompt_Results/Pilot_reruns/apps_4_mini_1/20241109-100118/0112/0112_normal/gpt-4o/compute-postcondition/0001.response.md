The variable `used_cubes` is assigned a list of boolean values, where each value corresponds to an index from 0 to n-1, indicating whether each cube has been used or not. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` will be a list of size `n` filled with `False`. The initial states of `n`, `cube_faces`, and `digits` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers each; `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of size n filled with False**.
