According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. Since the loop variable `i` takes values from 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to `n - 1` (the last valid index) at the end of the previous iteration.

To adjust the states accordingly:
- If `n` is at least 2, `i` must be increased to `n`, which is valid for the next iteration.
- The specific value of `i` is currently less than `n`, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, `i` must be equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, we can adjust `i` to `n`, and since `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged within the context of this iteration, we do not need to update `used_cubes[i]`. Other states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `i` is `n`**
