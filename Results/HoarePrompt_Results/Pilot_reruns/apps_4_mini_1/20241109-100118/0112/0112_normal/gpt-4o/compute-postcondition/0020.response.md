Output State: **If `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 and `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces[i]` for `i` in range(n) where `used_cubes[i]` is False, then `used_cubes[i]` corresponding to that index is set to True, and `found` is set to True. If no such condition is met, `found` remains False, and `used_cubes[i]` for all `i` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, the loop will not execute, and `found` will remain False, with `used_cubes` unchanged.**
