According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits`. If `digits` contains more elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is in the range [1, 3], `digit` is the next digit in `digits`, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` is set to False. 

Since `digit` is currently pointing to the next digit in `digits`, to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more digit in the `digits` list after the current `digit`. Therefore, if `digit` is the last element in `digits`, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `digit` should point to the next digit if available.

To summarize:
- `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure there are more digits available in the `digits`.
- `digit` should point to the next digit in the list.
- `found` remains unchanged as it is set to False.

State: **`n` is in the range [1, 2]; `digit` is the next digit in `digits`; `used_cubes` remains unchanged; `found` is set to False**
