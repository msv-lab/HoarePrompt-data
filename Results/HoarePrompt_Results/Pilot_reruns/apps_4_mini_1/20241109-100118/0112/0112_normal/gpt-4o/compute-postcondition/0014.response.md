According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, meaning that the loop has reached its termination condition. 

Since `n` is given to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `i` is currently `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` would need to be adjusted to a value greater than `n`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be greater than `n`, which would not be possible under the original constraints.

Thus, the state must reflect that `i` is now `n`, and `n` should be adjusted to allow for the loop to execute one more time, so it should be set to at least `n + 1` to ensure the loop can run for another iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 and `n` is adjusted to at least 4; cube_faces is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each; digits is a list of characters from the string representation of `num` with at least 1 character; digit is the first character in digits; i is `n`**
