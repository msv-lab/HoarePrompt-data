According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` contains at least 1 character, the loop will execute. The state before the loop states that `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num`. To ensure the loop can execute, `num` must be a string that has at least one character. 

Additionally, before the loop starts, the `digit` variable needs to be initialized to the first character of the `digits` list during the first iteration. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:

- Ensure that `digits` has at least 1 character.
- Set `digit` to the first character of the `digits` list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`**
