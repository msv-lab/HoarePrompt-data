According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1 since the range for the loop is defined as `range(n)`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it is already guaranteed that `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. 

There are no adjustments needed for `n`, but `i` needs to be initialized to 0 to reflect its starting value before the loop begins. The other variables (`cube_faces`, `digits`, `digit`, and `found`) do not affect the ability of the loop to execute but are present in the state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `found` is set to False, `i` is 0**
