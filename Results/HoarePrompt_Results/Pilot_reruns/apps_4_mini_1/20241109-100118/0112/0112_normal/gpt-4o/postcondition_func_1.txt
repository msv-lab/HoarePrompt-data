The function accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, which is expected to contain 1 to 3 lists of integers. It checks if each digit in `num` can be matched to a corresponding unused cube face from `cube_faces`. If all digits can be matched to distinct cube faces, it returns True. If any digit cannot be matched, or if `n` (the number of cube lists) is less than 1 or greater than 3, it returns False. Additionally, if `num` has no digits (i.e., it is empty), the function will return True. However, the function does not handle cases where `cube_faces` might be empty or when `num` is less than 1, as these conditions are not checked in the code.
