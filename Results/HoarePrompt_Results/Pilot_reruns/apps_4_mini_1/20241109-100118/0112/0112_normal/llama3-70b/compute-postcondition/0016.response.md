Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) followed by `n` lines, each containing 6 integers. It collects the unique digits from these integers into a set, removes '0' if present, and then constructs and prints the largest possible integer that can be formed by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. If all digits are '0', it will print 0. If `n` is 0, the function will not execute any input processing and will not print anything. **
