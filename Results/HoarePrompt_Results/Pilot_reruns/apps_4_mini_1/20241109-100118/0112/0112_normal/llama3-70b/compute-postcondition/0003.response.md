According to the code, the loop will execute based on the `cubes` list. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` must contain at least 1 list for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, `cube` will be the first list in `cubes`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, the state needs to reflect that `cubes` contains at least one list and that `cube` is the first list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing at least 1 list of integers, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
