The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `n` and `cubes`, along with the new state of `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers; `digits` is an empty set**
