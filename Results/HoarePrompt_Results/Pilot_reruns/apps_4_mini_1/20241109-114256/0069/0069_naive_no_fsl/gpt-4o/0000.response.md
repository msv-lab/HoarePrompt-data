Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the situation where the string `s` has a balance of `0`, and the desired balance `x` is also `0`. In this case, the program should return `-1` for infinite prefixes, but it checks if `x` is in the `prefix_balances` and appends `-1` only if it finds that `x` is in the list. This could lead to incorrect outputs for scenarios where the balance is perfectly balanced but does not yield `x` in the prefix sums.

For instance, consider the input:
```
1 0
01
```
Here, the balance of the string `s` is `0` (equal number of `0`s and `1`s), and the desired balance `x` is also `0`. The correct answer should be `-1` because there are infinitely many prefixes of `t` with a balance of `0`. However, the program will check if `0` is in the prefix balances and may incorrectly return `0` if `0` is not found at that point.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle this edge case properly.
