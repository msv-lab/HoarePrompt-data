According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. The loop will execute again for each element in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, and `result` is the second element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements, and `result` should then refer to the third element in the list.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`**
