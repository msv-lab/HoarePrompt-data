Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to each index from 1 to n, and if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with 0, while `prefix_balances` remains unchanged. If n is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros and the condition checks still apply to the empty list.***
