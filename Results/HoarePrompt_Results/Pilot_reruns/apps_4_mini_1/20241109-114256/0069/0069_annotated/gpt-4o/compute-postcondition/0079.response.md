The statement assigns a value to `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition checking `s[i - 1]`. The specific calculation is:

- `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is the value from the previous index of `prefix_balances`, which is `prefix_balances[1]`.
- If `s[i - 1]` (which is `s[1]` since `i` is 2) is equal to '0', it adds 1; otherwise, it subtracts 1.

Given that `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`, the output state will depend on the value of `s[1]`.

Let's denote the following:
- If `s[1]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[1] + 1`.
- If `s[1]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[1] - 1`.

Thus, the output state will reflect both cases based on the value of `s[1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index 2 based on `prefix_balances[1]` (either 1 or -1) and the value of `s[1]`, resulting in `prefix_balances[2]` being either 2 or 0 (if `s[1]` is '0') or 0 or -2 (if `s[1]` is not '0').**
