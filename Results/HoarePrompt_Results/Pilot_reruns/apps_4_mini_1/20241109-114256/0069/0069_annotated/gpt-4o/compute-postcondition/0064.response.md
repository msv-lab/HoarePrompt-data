Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is the third element in the list. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged. This encompasses all edge cases, including when `x` equals `b`, when `x` is less than `b`, and when `x` is significantly greater than `b`, as well as scenarios where `balance` is zero or negative.***
