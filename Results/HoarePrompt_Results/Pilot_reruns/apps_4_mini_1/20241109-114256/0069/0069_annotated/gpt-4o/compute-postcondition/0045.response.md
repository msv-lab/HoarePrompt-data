The variable `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus either `1` or `-1`, depending on whether the character at `s[i - 1]` is '0' or not. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is at least 1, and `prefix_balances` is initialized as a list of length `n + 1` with all values as `0`, the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is `prefix_balances[0]`, which is `0`. If `s[i - 1]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `0 + 1 = 1`. If `s[i - 1]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `prefix_balances[i]` based on the conditions mentioned. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index `i` to either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
