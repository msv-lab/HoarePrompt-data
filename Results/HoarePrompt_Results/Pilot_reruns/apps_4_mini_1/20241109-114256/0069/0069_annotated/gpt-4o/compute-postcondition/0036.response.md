Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to each index from 1 to n. If `balance` is 0, and if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with -1; otherwise, it is appended with 0. If `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and the checks for `x` still apply to this empty list. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` is appended with this `count`.***
