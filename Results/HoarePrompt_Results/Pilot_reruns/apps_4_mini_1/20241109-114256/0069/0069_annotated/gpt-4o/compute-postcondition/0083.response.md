Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for `1 <= i <= n`) represents the cumulative balance after processing the first `i` characters of the string `s`. If `s[i - 1]` is '0', `prefix_balances[i]` increases by 1 compared to `prefix_balances[i - 1]`, and if `s[i - 1]` is '1', it decreases by 1. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.**
