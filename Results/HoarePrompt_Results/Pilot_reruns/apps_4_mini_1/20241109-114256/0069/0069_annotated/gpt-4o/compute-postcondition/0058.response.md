Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is 0 initially, and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances` (which is 0). If the expression `(x - b) % balance == 0` evaluates to true and the integer division `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
