The function reads multiple test cases containing a binary string and an integer. For each test case, it calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in the string. If the balance is zero, it checks if the given integer exists in the cumulative balance array; if it does, it appends -1 to the results, otherwise 0. If the balance is not zero, it counts how many valid configurations exist for the integer based on the cumulative balances. Finally, it prints the results for each test case. Edge cases include handling when the binary string is empty or when the balance is zero, along with ensuring the integer checks are valid based on the cumulative balances.
