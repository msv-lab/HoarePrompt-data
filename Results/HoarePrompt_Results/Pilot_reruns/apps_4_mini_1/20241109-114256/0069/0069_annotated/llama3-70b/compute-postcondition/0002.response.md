The code assigns `n` and `x` the values obtained from `input().split()`, which are then converted into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The specific values of `n` and `x` will depend on the input provided at runtime. The variables `T` and `s` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`**
