Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, and if `n` is at least 1, then if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1 appended to it; otherwise, `results` contains 0 appended to it. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 initialized to 0s, and `results` contains 0 appended to it. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `count` is appended to `results`.***
