According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `prefix_balances`. The loop will continue to iterate as long as there are more elements in `prefix_balances` to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in `prefix_balances` after the current element `b` is processed.

To achieve this, we can adjust the state to indicate that `prefix_balances` must contain at least 2 elements and that `b` is now the second element in the list.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, and `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`.**
