According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. Since `n` is at least 1, it implies that `prefix_balances` should contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Thus, for the loop to execute, `prefix_balances` must have at least 1 element and `b` should be initialized to the first element of `prefix_balances`. 

State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, `count` is initialized to 0**
