Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 or 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the condition was satisfied; otherwise, `count` remains 0. The variable `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`.***
