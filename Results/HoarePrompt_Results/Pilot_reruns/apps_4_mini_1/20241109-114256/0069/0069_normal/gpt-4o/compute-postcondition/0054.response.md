Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index `i` contains the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s` up to index `i - 1`. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` will have `-1` appended to it. Otherwise, `results` will have `0` appended to it. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length 1, and the same logic for appending to `results` applies.***
