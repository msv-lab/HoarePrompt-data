The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned based on the calculation `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. Given that `i` is 3, we will access `prefix_balances[3]` and `prefix_balances[2]`. The specific values of `prefix_balances[2]` and `s[2]` (which is `s[i - 1]` or `s[2]`) are not provided, but the state of `prefix_balances` will be updated accordingly based on the conditions. 

Thus, the output state will remain contingent on the current values of `prefix_balances[2]` and whether `s[2]` is '0' or not.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0s, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the value of `s[2]`.**
