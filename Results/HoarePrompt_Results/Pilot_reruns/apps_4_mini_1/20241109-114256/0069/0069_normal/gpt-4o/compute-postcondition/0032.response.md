Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being either 1 or 2. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged and continues to be either 0 or 1. The list `prefix_balances` remains unchanged with at least 3 elements, and `b` retains its value as the third element in the list.***
