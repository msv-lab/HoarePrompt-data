Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index `i` contains the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s` up to index `i - 1`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` will have `-1` appended to it. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` will have `0` appended to it. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`; `results` now includes the current value of `count`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length 1, and the same logic for appending to `results` applies.***
