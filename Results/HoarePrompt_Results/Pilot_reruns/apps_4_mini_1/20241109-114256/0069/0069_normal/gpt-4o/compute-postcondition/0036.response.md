Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, then if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`; otherwise, `0` is appended. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains [0] and the same logic applies for appending either `-1` or `0` to `results` based on the presence of `x`. If `balance` is not 0, the `count` is computed by iterating through `prefix_balances`, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` for any `b`, `count` is incremented, and the final value of `count` is appended to `results`.***
