According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, meaning it can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is less than or equal to `n`. 

To determine the necessary adjustments:
1. If `i` is currently equal to `n`, then for the loop to run one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`.
2. The loop's condition is satisfied if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, so `i` must be adjusted to `n + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as there are no additional variables that influence the loop execution.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is n + 1**
