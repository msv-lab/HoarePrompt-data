To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `T`. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than the current iteration number (which is represented by the underscore `_`).

2. Since the loop uses an underscore `_`, it does not explicitly track the current iteration count, but we can infer that the current iteration number is implicitly tracked by the loop's execution.

3. At the end of the last iteration, `T` must have been at least equal to the current iteration count plus one for the loop to execute again. If `T` was equal to the current iteration count, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the adjustment needs to ensure that `T` is at least one greater than the current iteration count.

State: **`balance` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 initialized to 0s, `results` contains 0 appended to it, `T` is at least 1 greater than the last iteration count (which is implicitly tracked)**
