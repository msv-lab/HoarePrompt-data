The code prints the value of `result`. The variable `result` is the second value in `results`, and since `results` contains at least 2 values, `result` has a defined value. The print statement does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `results` contains at least 2 values, `T` is greater than 0, `result` is the second value in `results`, and the function prints `result`.

Output State: **`results` contains at least 2 values, `T` is greater than 0, `result` is the second value in `results`, and the function prints `result`**
