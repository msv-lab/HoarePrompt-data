Output State: **If T is greater than 0, then `results` contains at least T values, and the loop prints each value in `results` sequentially. If T is 0, the loop does not execute and `results` remains an empty list. If `data` does not contain enough elements for T iterations, it may lead to an IndexError before the loop starts.**
