According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. The loop will execute `T` times, so `T` must be at least 1 for the loop to start. The variable `index` is initialized to 1, which is appropriate as it will be used for the first iteration. The variable `results` is an empty list and does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0. 

State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
