The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `balance` is 0 or not 0, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `_` is the next value (current value + 1), `T` is greater than `_`, and `s` is assigned the value `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`balance` is 0 or not 0, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `_` is the next value (current value + 1), `T` is greater than `_`, `s` is assigned the value `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3**
