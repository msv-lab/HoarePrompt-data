Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index `i` contains the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s` up to index `i - 1`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length 1.**
