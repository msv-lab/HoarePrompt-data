The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, respectively. The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Since `s` is an input string, the exact counts of '0' and '1' will depend on its content.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
