Postcondition: ***`_` is less than `T`, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on user input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which calculates the number of steps required to reach the target based on the difference between `x` and `balance`. This covers edge cases such as when `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, preventing division by zero, as the handling of the modulo operation ensures that the program does not attempt to execute a division by zero scenario without proper checks.***
