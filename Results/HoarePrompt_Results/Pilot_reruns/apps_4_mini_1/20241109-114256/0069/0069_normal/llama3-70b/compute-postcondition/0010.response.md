Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. In all other cases where `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the behavior of the program in the else case is not defined, leading to potential division by zero, and thus the precondition does not guarantee a valid outcome for this scenario.***
