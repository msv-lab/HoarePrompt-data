The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. It also accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are distinct integers representing apartment numbers, satisfying the constraint 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. 

Based on the provided output, the function performs actions or checks concerning these parameters, but specific return values or conditions are not described here. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and distinct integers `a` and `b` as apartment numbers, ensuring they fall within the specified ranges and constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts positive integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and distinct integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k).**
