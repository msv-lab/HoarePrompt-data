The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned based on the input values provided by the user. The previous state of `n`, `m`, and `k` is unknown but must be within the range of positive integers (1 to 1000). After the execution of the code, `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the new values based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned values based on user input**
