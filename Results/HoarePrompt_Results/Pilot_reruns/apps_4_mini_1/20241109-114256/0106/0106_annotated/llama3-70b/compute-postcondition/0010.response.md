Output State: **`a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` are calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; `min_block_time` is computed based on the absolute difference and `n`; the function prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
