The value of `a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are based on user input, which are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `a_block` based on the unknown values of `a`, `m`, and `k`. 

Output State: **`a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, where `a`, `m`, and `k` are input values.**
