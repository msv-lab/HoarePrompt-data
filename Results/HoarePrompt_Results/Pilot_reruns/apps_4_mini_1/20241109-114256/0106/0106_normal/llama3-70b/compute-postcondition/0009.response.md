Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are input integers, and `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` are calculated. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. In both cases, `min_floor_time` accounts for the difference in floors multiplied by 5, plus an additional 10, ensuring that the calculation reflects the time taken based on the relative height of `a_floor` and `b_floor`.***
