The function accepts five integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as input, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are constrained between 1 and 1000, and `a` and `b` are constrained between 1 and `n*m*k`. It calculates the minimum time required to move from one block and floor (`a`) to another block and floor (`b`) based on their respective positions and differences in heights, and then prints the total time. The total time is a combination of the time taken to traverse blocks and floors, with specific calculations for each. Edge cases include ensuring `a` is not equal to `b`, as the code does not explicitly handle this scenario.
