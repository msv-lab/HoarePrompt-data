The variable `min_floor_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `b_floor` and `a_floor` are determined by previous calculations, but they remain unchanged by this line of code. The resulting value of `min_floor_time` depends on the specific values of `b_floor` and `a_floor`.

Since the exact values of `b_floor` and `a_floor` are not provided, we can only express `min_floor_time` in terms of those variables. After the execution, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is calculated, `a_block` is calculated, `b_floor` is calculated, `b_block` is calculated, `min_block_time` is calculated, and `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`**.
