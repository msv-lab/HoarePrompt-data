The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values based on user input, specifically two integers that will be input as a space-separated string. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` as input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are input integers based on user input; `a` and `b` are input integers from user input.**
