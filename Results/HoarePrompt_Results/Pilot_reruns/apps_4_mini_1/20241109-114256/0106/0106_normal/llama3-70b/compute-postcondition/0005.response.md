To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we first need to analyze the initial values and how the code affects them.

Initial State: `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers; `a` and `b` are input integers; 
- `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`
- `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
- `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`

Now, we will compute `b_block` using the provided formula:
```
b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

The value of `b_block` is calculated based on the input values of `b`, `m`, and `k`. This calculation does not affect the initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`, but it introduces a new variable `b_block`.

Therefore, the output state will include the existing variables and their values, along with the newly computed `b_block`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
