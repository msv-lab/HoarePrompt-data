To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables mentioned in the initial state.

1. The initial state provides that `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.
2. The code snippet provided calculates `floor` using the formula `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`.

Now, let's evaluate the impact of this calculation:

- `floor_within_block` is computed based on the previous state of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
- The value of `floor` is determined by taking the integer division of `floor_within_block` by `k`, then adding 1 to it.

Since we do not have specific values for `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, we can only describe the relationship:

- `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`, where `floor_within_block` is derived from the above calculations involving `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k); `floor` is calculated as floor_within_block // k + 1**
