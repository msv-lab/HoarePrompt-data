The value of `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. The previous values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are not affected by this assignment, and their values depend on `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block_a` and `floor_a` are values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are values from `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
