To determine the output state after running the given code, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet on the variables involved.

The code snippet is:
```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

In this code:
- The variable `apartment` represents a specific apartment number within the range defined by the positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- The expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k)` calculates the block number by determining how many full blocks of size `m * k` fit into the range of apartments up to the given apartment number.
- Finally, `1` is added to the computed value to get the block number, as blocks are typically counted starting from 1.

The output state does not specify the exact values for `apartment`, `m`, or `k`, but we know they are constrained within given ranges. Thus, we can infer the output state based on the calculations involved.

Output State: **`block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, where apartment is between 1 and n·m·k, m and k are positive integers with 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000**.
