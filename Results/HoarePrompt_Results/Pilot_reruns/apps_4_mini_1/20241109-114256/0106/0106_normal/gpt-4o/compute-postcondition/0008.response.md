The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The value of `floor_b` is previously defined by `get_location(b)`, but since we do not have the specific value of `floor_b`, we cannot calculate an exact numerical result for `time_to_target_floor`. However, we know that the calculation will yield a value that is 5 less than the product of `floor_b` by 5. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block_a` and `floor_a` are values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are values from `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is (floor_b - 1) * 5**
