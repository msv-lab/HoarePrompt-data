The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with values constrained between 1 and 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are distinct integers, each constrained to lie between 1 and \( n \cdot m \cdot k \). After executing the function, it calculates the total time based on the locations derived from `a` and `b`, using various time calculations related to walking and floors. The function ultimately returns the `total_time`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k as positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and distinct integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k). It calculates and returns total_time based on the walking and floor time derived from the locations of a and b.**
