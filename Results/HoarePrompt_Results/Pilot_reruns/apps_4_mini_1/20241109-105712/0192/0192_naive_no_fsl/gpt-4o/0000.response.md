To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the requirements outlined in the problem description and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: Two integers, `x` and `y`, where \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\).
2. **Output**: The minimum number of seconds required to change an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to side length `y`.
3. **Operations**: Each second, one side can be modified as long as it remains a non-degenerate triangle, meaning that all sides must always be positive integers.

### Program Logic:
The program calculates the number of seconds required to change the triangle's side length from `x` to `y` using the formula:
```python
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```
This can be interpreted as:
- `(x - y) // 2` calculates how many complete 2-unit reductions can be made in the side length per operation.
- `(x - y) % 2` accounts for any odd difference, indicating if there's one extra unit that still needs to be reduced.

### Edge Cases:
To verify if the program works correctly for all potential cases, letâ€™s consider some specific scenarios:
1. **Example Case**: 
   - Input: `6 3`
   - Expected output: `4` (as detailed in the problem).
   - Calculation: `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Incorrect)

2. **Another Case**:
   - Input: `8 5`
   - Expected output: `3`.
   - Calculation: `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Incorrect)

3. **Extreme Case**:
   - Input: `100 3`
   - Expected output: `49`.
   - Calculation: `(100 - 3) // 2 + (100 - 3) % 2 = 97 // 2 + 97 % 2 = 48 + 1 = 49` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
From the above examples, we can see that the program fails for the cases where \(x - y\) is an odd number (since it can't handle the necessary adjustments properly to ensure all sides remain positive integers). The formula does not account for the need to ensure that in each step, we can still maintain a valid non-degenerate triangle.

Thus, since there are specific cases where the output does not meet the required output as outlined in the problem description, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
