Correctness: **False**

The program provided calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` with the expression `abs(x - y)`. However, this does not account for the operations required to transition from an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to one of side length `y` while ensuring a non-degenerate triangle at every step.

For example, let's take the input `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The correct sequence of operations to achieve the target triangle from the starting triangle would require several steps to ensure that at no point do two sides become equal to or less than zero as the triangle must remain non-degenerate. The program simply outputs `3`, which incorrectly suggests that the difference in lengths is the answer. 

In reality, the transitions involve multiple adjustments to maintain the triangle's integrity, leading to a different count of operations. 

For another test case, `x = 8` and `y = 5`, the program would output `3`, but a careful step-by-step adjustment is required to ensure that the triangle remains valid during the modification process.

Thus, since the program does not accurately reflect the operations needed to transform the triangle while satisfying the problem's constraints, it is incorrect.
