The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new values from the input. The input consists of two integers, and they are mapped to `x` and `y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are overwritten by these new values from the input. Since the initial condition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the new values will also comply with these constraints. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state reflects the new values of `x` and `y` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are new integers based on input, satisfying 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
