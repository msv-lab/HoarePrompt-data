The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on input, where `input()` takes a space-separated string of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The initial constraints are that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but since the actual input values are not provided, the output state cannot specify the exact values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the output state is that `x` and `y` are now assigned input integers satisfying the given conditions.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are assigned input integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
