The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, ensuring that they meet the constraints 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. It then calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. There are no return statements in the function, and it does not handle any errors or invalid inputs, relying on the assumption that the inputs will always satisfy the given constraints.
