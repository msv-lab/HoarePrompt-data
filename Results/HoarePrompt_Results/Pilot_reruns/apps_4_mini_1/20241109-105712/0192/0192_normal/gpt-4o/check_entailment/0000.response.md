To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the expected behavior.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. The transformation can only be done in such a way that the triangle remains non-degenerate (meaning all sides must be positive integers).

### Provided Program:
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` can be interpreted as calculating the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. This calculation effectively represents how many "moves" are needed to reduce the side length from `x` to `y`.

2. **Non-Degenerate Triangle Condition**:
   - The code does not explicitly check for the non-degenerate triangle condition. However, given the constraints of `3 ≤ y < x`, we can deduce that as long as we are reducing `x` to `y`, the sides will remain positive integers, thus maintaining the non-degenerate condition throughout the modifications.

3. **Examples from the Problem Description**:
   - Example 1: If `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the difference `x - y = 3`, so the result should be `(3 // 2) + (3 % 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`, but the expected output states that it takes 4 seconds. This indicates that the program does not account for the necessary intermediate steps to ensure all sides remain valid.
   - The same issue arises in other examples provided.

### Output Hints:
The output hints summarize that the function computes the ceiling of the half difference between `x` and `y`. However, the hints do not address the fact that the transformation must maintain the triangle's non-degenerate property at all times. 

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to ensure that the triangle remains valid throughout the transformation process. The formula used fails to account for the necessary steps to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate at each stage of the transformation.

**Correctness: False**.
