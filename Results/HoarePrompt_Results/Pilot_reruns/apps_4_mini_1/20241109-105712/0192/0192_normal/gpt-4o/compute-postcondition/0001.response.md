The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the integer division of `(x - y)` by 2 and adds the remainder of `(x - y)` when divided by 2. 

1. Since `x` and `y` are integers based on the input values with the conditions `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the result of `(x - y)` will always be a positive integer.
2. The expression will evaluate to a non-negative integer because both parts `(x - y) // 2` and `(x - y) % 2` are non-negative integers.

However, since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the relationship:
- The output will be dependent on the specific values of `x` and `y`, but the calculation will yield a valid integer result.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on input values such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is a non-negative integer based on the calculation of (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2.**
