The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided, where `map(int, input().split())` splits the input into two integers. The previous conditions specify that `y` must be at least 3 and less than `x`, which is at most 100,000. Therefore, after execution, `x` and `y` will have specific integer values based on the input, but their exact values are not determined until input is given. 

Thus, the output state will indicate that `x` and `y` are now integers based on the input values, while adhering to the original constraints.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on input values such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
