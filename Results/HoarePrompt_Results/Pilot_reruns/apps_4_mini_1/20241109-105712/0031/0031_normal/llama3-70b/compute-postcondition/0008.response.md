The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is 2, and `total_days` is 2. Therefore, `denominator` becomes 2 * 2, which is 4. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 1**
