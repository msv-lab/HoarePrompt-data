The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 1 and \(10^{18}\) and `k` is between 2 and \(10^{18}\). It calculates the total number of days as \(2^n\) and computes a fraction based on `k`. If `k` is less than 2, it returns the tuple (1, 1). However, the logic for cases where `k` is equal to or greater than 2 is not implemented in the provided code, which may lead to incorrect behavior or unintended results for those cases. Therefore, the function is limited in its functionality as it does not handle scenarios where `k` is 2 or more correctly.
