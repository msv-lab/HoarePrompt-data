According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `k` must be greater than 3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `k` is greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer greater than 3, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, `i` is 3**
