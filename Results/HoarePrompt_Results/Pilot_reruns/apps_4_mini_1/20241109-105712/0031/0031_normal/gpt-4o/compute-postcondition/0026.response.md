To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, we first note the initial state of the variables involved:

- `p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`
- `p_total` is the value of `denominator`
- `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`
- `A` is the result of `(previous value of p_shared // g)`
- `B` is updated to `(previous value of p_total // g)`
- `g` is the result of `func_1(A, B)`

Now, after executing the code `print(A % MOD, B % MOD)`, we need to determine the values of `A` and `B` in their current state:

1. `A` will be the result of `(previous value of p_shared // g)` which means it is a division of the `p_shared` value by `g`. 
2. `B` will be the updated value `(previous value of p_total // g)` meaning it is the division of `p_total` by `g`.

The output of the print statement will display `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`. 

Since it is not specified what `numerator`, `denominator`, `MOD`, or the function `func_1(A, B)` return, we only state their effects.

Output State: **A is the result of (previous value of p_shared // g), B is updated to (previous value of p_total // g), and the function prints (A % MOD, B % MOD)**.
