To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem description states that we need to compute the probability that at least two people share the same birthday among a given number of days and return this probability as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \). 

### Code Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It appears to be correctly implemented.
   
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It first checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If so, it prints `(1, 1)`, which is correct because if there are more people than days, at least two people must share a birthday.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the number of ways to select `k` birthdays without sharing, and then derives the probability of shared birthdays.
   - The use of modular arithmetic is appropriate given the constraints.

### Edge Cases

1. **Case when `k = 2` and `n = 1`**:
   - There are \( 2^1 = 2 \) days. The probability of both people having the same birthday (which is guaranteed) should return \( \frac{1}{1} \).
   - The code handles this case correctly as it checks for \( k > 1 << n \) first.

2. **Case when `k = 2^n`**:
   - This is the boundary case where the number of people equals the number of days. The output should still be \( \frac{1}{1} \) since there would be multiple people sharing the same birthday.
   - The code correctly calculates the probability and uses GCD to reduce it.

3. **Case when `k` is very large (e.g., `k > 2^n + 1`)**:
   - The code correctly identifies when `k` exceeds `2^n` and immediately returns `(1, 1)`.

4. **Case when `k = 1`**:
   - Although the constraints state \( k \geq 2 \), if this were to occur, it would not be handled. However, since \( k \) is guaranteed to be at least 2, this is not an issue.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints describe that if `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints `(1, 1)`, which is accurate. For the cases where `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it correctly computes the numerator and denominator and reduces them using GCD.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering edge cases, I find that the program correctly addresses the problem description and handles the necessary cases as outlined. No potential edge cases lead to incorrect behavior, and the hints provided accurately reflect the functionality of the code.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
