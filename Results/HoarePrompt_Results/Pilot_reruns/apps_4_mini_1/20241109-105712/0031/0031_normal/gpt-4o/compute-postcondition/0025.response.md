To analyze the provided code snippet step by step based on the initial state, we have the following:

1. `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
2. The code performs an integer division of `B` by `g` (which is the result of `func_1(A, B)`).
3. Since `B` is modified directly in the statement `B //= g`, the new value of `B` will be `p_total // g`.

Given that `p_total` and `g` are already defined by the initial state, `B` will be updated accordingly. The states of `p_no_shared`, `p_shared`, `A`, and `g` will remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `B` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, `A` is the result of (previous value of `p_shared // g`), `B` is updated to (previous value of `p_total // g`), and `g` is the result of func_1(A, B)**
