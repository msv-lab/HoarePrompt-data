According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `denominator` is updated but we do not have values for `i` or `k`. However, we know that in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

Since we lack a specific value for `i`, we can generalize that `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`, and `k` remains unchanged. Thus, we can denote that `i` needs to be one less than `k` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is less than k**
