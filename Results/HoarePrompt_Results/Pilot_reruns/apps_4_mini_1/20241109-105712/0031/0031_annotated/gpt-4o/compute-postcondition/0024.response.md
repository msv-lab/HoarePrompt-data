Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `total_days`, `total_days - 1`, ..., `total_days - (k - 1)` modulo `1000003`; `denominator` is `total_days^k` modulo `1000003`; `p_no_shared` is `numerator`; `p_total` is `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; `A` is modified by dividing it by the result of `g`, which is not specified, so the exact value of `A` after the division is unknown.**
