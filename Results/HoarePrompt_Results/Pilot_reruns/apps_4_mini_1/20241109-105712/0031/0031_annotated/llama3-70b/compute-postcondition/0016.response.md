The value of `denominator` is modified by performing an integer division by `gcd`. The previous value of `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. This operation reduces `denominator` by removing the common factor shared with `gcd`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`; `denominator` is now `denominator` divided by `gcd`; `total_days` is `2^n`; `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`; `denominator` is now `denominator` divided by `gcd`; `total_days` is `2^n`; `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`**.
