According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^(2n) - 2^n, `denominator` is 2^(2n), `i` is 2**
