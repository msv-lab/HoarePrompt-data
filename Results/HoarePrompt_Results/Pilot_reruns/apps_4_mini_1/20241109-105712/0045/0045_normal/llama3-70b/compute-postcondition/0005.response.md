According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `b` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is assigned the value of `a_initial % b_initial`, which is non-zero. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must remain non-zero.

Since `b` is currently non-zero but is derived from the modulus operation (`a_initial % b_initial`), we can conclude that `a_initial` must be greater than or equal to `b_initial` for `b` to be non-zero. No adjustments to `a` are necessary, as it is already assigned the value of `b_initial`.

Thus, we can state that for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure `b` remains non-zero.

State: **`a` is assigned the value of `b_initial`, `b` is assigned a non-zero value**
