Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is greater than 0, it returns the last non-zero value of `b` as the GCD; if `b` is 0 at the start, it returns the initial value of `a`. The function handles cases where both inputs are zero, returning zero in that instance, which is a special edge case for the GCD. **
