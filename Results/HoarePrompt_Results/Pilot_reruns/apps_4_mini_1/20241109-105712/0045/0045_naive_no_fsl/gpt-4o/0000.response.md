To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of this sequence should be maximized.
3. If it's impossible to form such a sequence, we should return `-1`.

### Analyzing the Code:
- The line `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is `1 + 2 + ... + k`.
- If `min_sum > n`, it correctly returns `-1` since it's impossible to create such a sequence.
- The next steps involve finding a base number `d` which is the quotient of `n` by `min_sum`, and then tries to distribute the remainder to form the strictly increasing sequence.

### Potential Issues:
1. **GCD Maximization**: The program tries to maximize the GCD by scaling the sequence by `d`. However, after scaling, it adjusts the last few elements by adding `1` to them if there's any remainder. This distribution could lead to a loss in the GCD maximization, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.
2. **Output Format**: The program outputs the sequence as specified, but it's crucial that the GCD of the resulting sequence is indeed the maximum possible divisor.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider some inputs:

1. **Example Case**: For `n = 6` and `k = 3`, the output is `1 2 3`. The GCD is `1`, which is correct.
2. **Edge Case**: For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is `6` (from `1 + 2 + 3`). The calculated `d = 9 // 6 = 1`, and the remainder is `3`. The sequence generated is `[1, 2, 3]` plus the remainder; however, this does not maximize the GCD since it leads to the same sequence. A better approach could be `[3, 4, 5]` which gives a GCD of `1`.

3. **Failure Case**: For `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is `6`. The program calculates `d = 10 // 6 = 1` and the remainder is `4`. The sequence produced will be `[1, 2, 3]` plus adjustments leading to `[1, 2, 7]`, which does not maximize the GCD effectively.

### Conclusion:
The program may fail to produce a sequence with the maximum GCD for certain combinations of `n` and `k`, particularly when the remainder is adjusted improperly after scaling. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that the output will always yield the maximum GCD as required.

Correctness: **False**
