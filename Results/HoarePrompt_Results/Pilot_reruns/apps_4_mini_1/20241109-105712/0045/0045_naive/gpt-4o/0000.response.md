To evaluate the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. We need to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
3. If it is not possible to create such a sequence, the function should return -1.

### Program Logic Review:
- The program calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it correctly returns -1, as it's impossible to create a sequence.
- The program computes `d`, which is the maximum multiplier such that the sequence can still be strictly increasing and its sum equals `n`. The sequence is initialized as `sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`.
- It then distributes any remaining value (`remainder`) to the last elements of the sequence to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: When `n` and `k` are both 1. The sequence should be `[1]` and the output should be valid.
2. **Sum is Less than Minimum**: If `n=1` and `k=2`, the program should return -1 since we can't create two distinct positive integers that sum to 1.
3. **Maximum Values**: We need to check if the program handles large inputs correctly, such as `n=10^10` and `k=10^10`.

### Example Cases to Test:
- `n = 1, k = 2`: Expected output is -1. The program should handle this case and return -1.
- `n = 10, k = 4`: The minimum sum is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, so the output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- `n = 100, k = 5`: The minimum sum is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`, and can be distributed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to be correctly designed to handle the specified cases, including the edge cases evaluated. No counterexamples were found that would cause the program to fail according to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates sequences according to the problem description while accounting for necessary edge cases.
