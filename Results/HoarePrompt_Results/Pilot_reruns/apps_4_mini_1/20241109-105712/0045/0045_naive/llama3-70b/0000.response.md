To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Basic Check**: It checks if `n < k`. If this is true, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sums to `n` in that case.
3. **Sequence Construction**: The program attempts to construct a sequence of the first `k` positive integers: `[1, 2, 3, ..., k]`. It keeps reducing `n` by the value of each integer added to the sequence.
4. **Final Check**: After attempting to build the sequence, if the length of the sequence is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.

Now let's consider the requirement of "greatest common divisor is maximal." The program only constructs the sequence `[1, 2, ..., k]`, which will always have a GCD of `1` unless `n` can be divided by `k`, in which case it does not adjust the sequence to have a higher GCD.

### Counterexample:
- For the input `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program will produce the sequence `1, 2, 3` summing to `6`, which is incorrect because it does not use the full `n`.
- For `n = 12` and `k = 3`, a valid output could be `2, 4, 6` (GCD = 2), but the program does not generate this and instead would output `1, 2, 3` (GCD = 1).

The program misses the requirement to maximize the GCD of the sequence.

Thus, since the program does not correctly handle the requirements laid out in the problem description, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
