According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0` (the first iteration of the loop will be with `i = k - 1`, and the loop will execute down to `i = 0`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `-1`, which is outside the valid range for the loop. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to `-1` to reflect that the loop can no longer execute further.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not change based on the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence` is a list of size `k` containing the values `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]` with `sequence[-1]` increased by 1; `sequence[0]` is increased by 1, `i` is -1**
