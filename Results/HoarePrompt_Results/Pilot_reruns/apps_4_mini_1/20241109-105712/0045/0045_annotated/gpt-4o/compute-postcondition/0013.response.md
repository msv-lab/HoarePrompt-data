Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence` is a list of size `k` containing the values `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is -1. If `remainder` equals 0, the loop or if statement is exited, indicating that no further iterations are needed.***
