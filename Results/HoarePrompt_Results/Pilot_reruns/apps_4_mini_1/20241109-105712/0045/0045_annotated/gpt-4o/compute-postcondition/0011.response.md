According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which starts from `k - 1` and decrements until it reaches 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to -1.

Since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the value of `k` remains the same, and there are no other states that need to be modified for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence` is a list of size k containing the values [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)], `i` is -1**
