Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function does not return any value, indicating that `n` is sufficient to meet or exceed the minimum required sum.***
