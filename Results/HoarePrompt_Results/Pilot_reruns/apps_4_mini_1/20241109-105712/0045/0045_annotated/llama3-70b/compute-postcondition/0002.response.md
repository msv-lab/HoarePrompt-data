The code `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously assigns new values to `a` and `b`. Specifically, `a` will take the current value of `b`, and `b` will take the value of `a % b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (not directly affected)
- `k` is a positive integer (not directly affected)
- `a` is assigned the value of `b` (but we need to consider `b`'s initial value)
- `b` is greater than 0.

After executing the code:
- `a` becomes the previous value of `b`.
- `b` becomes `a % b`. Since `b` is greater than 0, `a % b` will yield a non-negative result.

However, the exact new values of `a` and `b` cannot be determined without knowing the initial values of `a` and `b`. Thus, the output state will reflect the changes without specific values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`**.
