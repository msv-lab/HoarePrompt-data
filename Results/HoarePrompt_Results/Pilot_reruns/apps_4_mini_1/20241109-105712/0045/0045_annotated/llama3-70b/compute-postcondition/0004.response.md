The values of `a` and `b` are swapped; `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is greater than `b`, `a % b` will yield a positive integer less than `b`. Therefore, after the execution, `a` will have the original value of `b`, and `b` will have the value of `a % b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` takes the original value of `b`, `b` takes the value of `a % b`, and `a` is greater than `b`**
