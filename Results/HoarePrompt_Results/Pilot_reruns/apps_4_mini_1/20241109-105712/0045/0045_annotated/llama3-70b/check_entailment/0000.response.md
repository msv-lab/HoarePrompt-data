The provided code is focused on calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described. The goal is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have a maximal GCD. The code does not implement any logic that constructs such a sequence or checks the conditions outlined in the problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem Description:
1. **Input**: Two positive integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Output**: A strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers that sum to `n` and have a maximal GCD, or `-1` if such a sequence does not exist.

### Annotations and Their Analysis:
- The provided function calculates the GCD of two integers but does not do anything with the input values `n` and `k`.
- There are no checks or constructions of the strictly increasing sequence of `k` integers that sum to `n`.
- The GCD calculation is not relevant to forming the necessary sequence based on the problem requirements.

### Potential Cases Where the Code Fails:
1. For inputs like `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the expected output is `-1` since it is impossible to form a strictly increasing sequence of 3 positive integers that sum to 5. The code does not handle such cases at all.
2. The code does not attempt to produce any output related to the requirements of forming the sequence, making it impossible to satisfy the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not address the requirements of the problem description and fails to construct a valid output for even simple cases, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
