The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeroes using the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, the leading zeroes will be removed, and if `data[0]` consists solely of zeroes, `a` will become an empty string. The variable `b` is not affected by this operation, and neither is the `data` list. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` based on the contents of `data[0]`.

Output State: **`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` remains a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is unchanged.**
