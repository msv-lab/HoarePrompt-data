Postcondition: ***`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, or '0' if `a` is empty. `b` is '0' if initially empty, or its original string value without leading zeroes. The function prints '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and prints '=' otherwise. The values of `a` and `b` are compared lexicographically as strings, and the `data` remains unchanged throughout.***
