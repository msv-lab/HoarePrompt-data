Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in handling the comparison of the two integers, specifically in cases where both integers are equal after leading zero removal. The code relies on lexicographical comparison after stripping leading zeros, which can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
000123
123
```

With the current implementation, both `a` and `b` would be stripped of leading zeros, resulting in `a = "123"` and `b = "123"`. The program would then print `=` correctly, which is expected.

However, let's consider this input:

```
000000
000000
```

After stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` become empty strings. The comparison `if (a == b)` would evaluate to `True`, and the program would print `=`. This is correct in terms of equality. 

Now, let's test with:

```
000001
1
```

After stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` become `"1"`, and the output will also be `=`. This is also correct.

However, the code fails to handle the case where leading zeros may result in an entirely empty string, which would not be valid input according to the problem description as it states integers are non-negative. The leading zeros should not allow for the representation of a zero-length integer. 

Moreover, the code does not check for inputs that might consist entirely of zeros (like `0000`) and expects the output to be `=`. While this specific case may not be explicitly wrong, it does not enforce the constraints of the problem description properly, as it allows for an ambiguous interpretation of input.

Furthermore, if we consider the edge case of inputs like:

```
0000000
0000001
```

The program would again output `>`, which is correct. But the logic remains flawed in its handling of different forms of leading zeros.

This inconsistency and the potential for incorrect outputs in extreme edge cases where leading zero stripping occurs make the program incorrect according to the problem description. 

Thus, the annotations that describe the state of variables and the expected outputs do not fully ensure that all potential cases are covered correctly, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is not robust enough to handle all edge cases as per the problem description. Hence, the final judgment on correctness is **False**.
