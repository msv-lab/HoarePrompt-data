The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it will take input and remove any leading zeros from the string. Since `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, after removing leading zeros, `b` could potentially become an empty string if the input was all zeros. The value of `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b` after processing the input.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeros; `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros**
