The `print('>')` statement outputs the string `>` to the console. It does not change the values of the variables `a` and `b`, which remain as they were initially defined. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, along with the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeros; `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros; output is '>'**
