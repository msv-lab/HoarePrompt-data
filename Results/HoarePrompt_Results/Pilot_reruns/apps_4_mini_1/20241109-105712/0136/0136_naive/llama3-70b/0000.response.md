Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where both input numbers are "0". In this case, when both inputs are "0", the program will strip the leading zeroes, resulting in an empty string for both `a` and `b`. The comparison `if a == b:` will evaluate to `True`, and it will print `=`. However, the problem description states that the inputs can be "0" and should be treated as equal, but the program does not account for the case where both inputs are "0" leading to the correct output.

Additionally, the program would fail for cases where the inputs are entirely made up of leading zeroes, such as "0000" and "0000", which should also result in an output of `=`. 

Thus, there are scenarios where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description.
