The code `print('=')` outputs a string with an equal sign, but it does not affect the values of the variables `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b` while indicating that an equal sign has been printed.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, and an equal sign has been printed.**
