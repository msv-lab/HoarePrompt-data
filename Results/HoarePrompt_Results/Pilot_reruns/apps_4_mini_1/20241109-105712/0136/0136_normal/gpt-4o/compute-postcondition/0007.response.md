The code executes a print statement which displays the string '<'. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same in terms of `a` and `b`, but includes the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer, which is set to '0' if it was initially empty; `b` is a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros. If `b` is empty, it is updated to '0'; printed output is '<'.**
