The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings (potentially with leading zeros) from user input, compares them, and prints the result of the comparison. If either of the inputs is empty after stripping leading zeros, it treats it as '0'. It handles cases where the lengths of the strings differ and also compares the values lexicographically for equal lengths. The function prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. It also ensures that '0' is printed for any empty input.
