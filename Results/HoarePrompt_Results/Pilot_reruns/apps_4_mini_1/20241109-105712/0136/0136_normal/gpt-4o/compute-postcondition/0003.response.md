The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`, which is a string representation of the non-negative integer 0. The initial state indicates that `a` is derived from `data[0]`, but now it is explicitly set to `'0'`. The variable `b` remains unaffected in this execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` and the unchanged state of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros**
