Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from user input, where `n` and `m` represent the sizes of two lists of integers. It then takes two lists of integers `s` and `b`. The function calculates the minimum buying price from list `s` and the maximum selling price from list `b`. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates how many shares can be bought with `r` at the minimum buying price and the remaining funds after those purchases, and computes the total amount of bourles after selling the shares at the maximum selling price. The function then prints this total bourles. The function does not return any value, it only prints the results based on the described conditions. **
