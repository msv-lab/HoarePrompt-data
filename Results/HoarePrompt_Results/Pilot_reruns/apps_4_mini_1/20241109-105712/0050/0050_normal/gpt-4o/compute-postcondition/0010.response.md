Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` plus `remaining_bourles`, which the function then prints. This covers the case where the prices are equal or where the maximum selling price is less than the minimum buying price, as well as cases where there are sufficient funds for at least one purchase or not enough to buy even one share.***
