The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from user input in descending order, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
