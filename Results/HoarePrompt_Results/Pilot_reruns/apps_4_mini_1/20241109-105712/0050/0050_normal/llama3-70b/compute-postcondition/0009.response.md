The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from user input in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
