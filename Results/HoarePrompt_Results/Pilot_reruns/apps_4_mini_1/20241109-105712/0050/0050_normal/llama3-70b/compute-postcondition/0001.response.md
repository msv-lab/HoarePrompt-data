The code assigns `s` a list of integers by taking input and mapping it to integers. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but `s` will be assigned a new value based on user input. As the input is expected to be a space-separated list of integers, the exact contents of `s` will depend on that input. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, while indicating that `s` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input, and `s` is a list of integers from user input**
