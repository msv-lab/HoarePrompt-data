Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from user input in descending order, and `i` is 2. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that no further shares can be calculated with the current value of `r`. Additionally, edge cases include scenarios where `r` is exactly equal to `s[i]`, resulting in `shares` being incremented by 1, and `r` being set to 0. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, it does not alter `shares` or `r` and exits the loop.***
