Postcondition: ***`shares` is the total number of complete shares that can be bought with `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, and `m` is greater than 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, the loop is exited without any changes to `r` or `shares`.***
