The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is the total number of complete shares that can be bought with `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
