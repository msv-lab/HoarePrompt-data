Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 30, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 30, `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers based on user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers based on user input in reverse order, and `shares` is updated by the number of complete shares that can be bought with `r` using the first element of `s`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`, and `i` remains 0. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or statement, leaving `shares` unchanged at 0 and `i` as 0. This implies that if `r` is not sufficient to buy shares based on `s[i]`, the program ceases further processing.***
