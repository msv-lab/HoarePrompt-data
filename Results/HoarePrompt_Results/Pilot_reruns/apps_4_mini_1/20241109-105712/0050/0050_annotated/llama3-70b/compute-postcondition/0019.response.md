The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers based on user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers based on user input in reverse order, `shares` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
