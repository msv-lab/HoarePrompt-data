The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 30, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 30, `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers based on user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers based on user input in reverse order, `shares` is updated by the number of complete shares that can be bought with `r` using the first element of `s`, and `i` is less than `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
