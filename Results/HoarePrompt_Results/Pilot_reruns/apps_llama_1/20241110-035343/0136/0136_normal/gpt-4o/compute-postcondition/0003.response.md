The value of `a` is reassigned to `'0'`. The previous values of `a` and `b` were strings `data[0]` and `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, respectively. However, the value of `a` is now overridden to `'0'`. The value of `b` and `data` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the string `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, `data` is a list of two input strings**
