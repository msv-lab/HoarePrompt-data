Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code is correct. The code reads two non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, removes leading zeroes, and compares them based on length and lexicographical order, printing '<', '>', or '=' accordingly.

After reviewing the output hints, I see that they agree with the code. The hints mention that the function removes leading zeroes and compares the numbers based on length and lexicographical order, which is consistent with the code.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the code has a bug. The issue is with the way the input is read. The `input = sys.stdin.read` line reads the entire input, including the newline character, into a single string. The `data = input().split()` line then splits this string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace. However, since the input is read as a single string, the `split()` method will not work as expected.

For example, if the input is:
```
9
10
```
The `input()` function will read the entire input as a single string `"9\n10"`, and the `split()` method will not split it into two separate strings. As a result, the `a` and `b` variables will not be assigned the correct values.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input is read as a single string, and the `split()` method does not work as expected.
