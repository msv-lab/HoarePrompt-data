To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed.
- `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at most 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes.

The code snippet is:
```python
b = input().lstrip('0')
```
This line of code does the following:
- It takes an input from the user, which is expected to be a string.
- It removes any leading zeroes from the input string using the `lstrip('0')` method.
- It assigns the result back to the variable `b`.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the code snippet provided, as it does not relate to the initial state of `a` and `b` directly. The code snippet appears to be intended to read a new input and remove leading zeroes from it, but it does not utilize the initial state of `a` and `b` in any way.

Given the code snippet and the initial state, the output state would be:
- `a` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `a`.
- `b` is reassigned to a new input string with leading zeroes removed.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a new input string with leading zeroes removed**
