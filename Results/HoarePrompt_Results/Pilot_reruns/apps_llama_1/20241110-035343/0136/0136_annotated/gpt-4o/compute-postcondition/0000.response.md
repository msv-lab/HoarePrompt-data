The input() function accepts a string input, and the split() function splits the input string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace. 

In the initial state, a and b are strings representing non-negative integers, possibly with leading zeroes, and each containing no more than 10^6 digits. However, the given code does not use these variables directly. Instead, it assigns the result of input().split() to the variable data.

The data variable is assigned a list of substrings separated by whitespace from the input string. The values of a and b are not affected by this code.

Output State: **a and b are strings representing non-negative integers, possibly with leading zeroes, and each containing no more than 10^6 digits; data is a list of substrings separated by whitespace from the input string**
