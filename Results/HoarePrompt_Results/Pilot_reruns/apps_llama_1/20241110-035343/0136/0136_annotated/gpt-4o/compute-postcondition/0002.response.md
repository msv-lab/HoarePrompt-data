The value of `b` is reassigned to `data[1].lstrip('0')`, which removes leading zeroes from the second substring in `data`. The value of `a` and the rest of `data` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with no leading zeroes, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer with no leading zeroes, and `data` is a list of substrings separated by whitespace from the input string**
