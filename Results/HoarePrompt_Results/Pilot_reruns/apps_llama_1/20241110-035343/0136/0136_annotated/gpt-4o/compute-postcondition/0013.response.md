Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers with no leading zeroes, and `data` is a list of substrings separated by whitespace from the input string. If either `a` or `b` is an empty string, it is set to `'0'`, otherwise they remain unchanged. The program prints '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` and `b` are lexicographically equal.***
