Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the input size is very large and recommends using fast input/output methods. However, the code uses the built-in `input()` function, which is not efficient for large inputs.

Additionally, the code assumes that the input will always be two separate lines, but the problem description does not guarantee this. If the input is a single line with two numbers separated by whitespace, the code will not work correctly.

The annotations mention that the code reads the input line by line, but this is not explicitly stated in the problem description. The annotations also mention that the code removes leading zeroes, but this is not necessary according to the problem description, which allows leading zeroes.

The code also has a logical error. In the case where the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the code checks if `a` is lexicographically less than `b` and prints '<' if true, but it does not check if `a` is lexicographically equal to `b` and print '=' if true. This means that if `a` and `b` are equal, the code will not print '=' as expected.

The annotations did influence my reasoning, as they pointed out the potential issue with the input size and the assumption about the input format. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that the code has a logical error that is not addressed by the annotations.

Overall, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and therefore, Correctness: **False**.
