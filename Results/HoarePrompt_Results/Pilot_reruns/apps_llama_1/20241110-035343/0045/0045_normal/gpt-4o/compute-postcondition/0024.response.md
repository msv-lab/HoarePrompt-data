The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers. After executing the function body, there are two possible return cases:

Case 1: If the minimum sum (`min_sum`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.

Case 2: If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function returns a list of `k` integers. If `n` is equal to `min_sum`, the list contains integers that are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k`. If `n` is greater than `min_sum`, the list contains integers that are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - remainder`, and the last `remainder` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from `k - remainder + 1` to `k` plus 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return -1 if the minimum sum is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it returns a list of `k` integers based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and returns -1 if the minimum sum is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it returns a list of `k` integers based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
