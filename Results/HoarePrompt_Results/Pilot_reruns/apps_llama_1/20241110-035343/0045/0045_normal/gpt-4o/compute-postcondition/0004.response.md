To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`
- `k` is a positive integer
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`
- `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`

The code is:
```python
remainder = n - d * min_sum
```

Now, let's analyze the code:
- `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`.
- Since `d` is the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, we can write `n` as `n = d * min_sum + r`, where `r` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`.
- Substituting this expression for `n` into the code, we get `remainder = (d * min_sum + r) - d * min_sum`.
- Simplifying this expression, we get `remainder = r`, which means `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`.

The output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`
- `k` is a positive integer
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`
- `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`
- `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`.**
