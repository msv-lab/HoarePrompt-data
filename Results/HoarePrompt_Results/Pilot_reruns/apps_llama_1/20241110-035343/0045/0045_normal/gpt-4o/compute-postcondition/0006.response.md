To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement: `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0, since the range starts from `k - 1` and goes down to `-1`. 

Given the initial state, we already have `k` as a positive integer, which means `k` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute.

However, to make the state more specific to the start of the loop, we need to adjust the state to reflect the initial value of `i`, which is `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k`, and `i` is `k - 1`.**
