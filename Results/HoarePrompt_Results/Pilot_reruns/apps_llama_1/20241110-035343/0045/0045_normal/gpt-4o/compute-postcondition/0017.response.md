Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 2, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 1`, the element at index `k - 2` is `d * (k - 1) + 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`, `i` is `k - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
