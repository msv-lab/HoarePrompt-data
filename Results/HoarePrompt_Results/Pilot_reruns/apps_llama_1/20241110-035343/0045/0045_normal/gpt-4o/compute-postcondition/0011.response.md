To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement and the given state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Since `i` is the loop counter, we need to adjust its value. No other states depend on the loop counter `i`, so only `i` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 1, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`, and `i` is `k - 2`.**
