The function accepts two positive integers n and k, returns -1 if the minimum sum is greater than n, and returns a list of k integers based on the values of n and k if n is greater than or equal to the minimum sum. If n is not a positive integer or k is not a positive integer, the function's behavior is undefined. If n is equal to min_sum, the function returns a list of k integers where each integer is d times the corresponding integer from 1 to k.
