To solve this task, we need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder`. The code snippet defines a new variable `sequence` using a list comprehension.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The value of `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is a fixed value based on `k`.
2. The value of `d` is the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, which is also a fixed value based on `n` and `min_sum`.
3. The list comprehension `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]` generates a list of values by multiplying `d` with each integer from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
4. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `sequence`.

Based on the initial state and the code snippet, we can conclude that:

* The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` remain unchanged.
* A new variable `sequence` is created, which is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k`.**
