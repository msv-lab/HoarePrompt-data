Output State: **The loop increments the last 'remainder' elements of the sequence by 1, in reverse order. If 'remainder' is 0, the loop does not execute. After the loop executes, 'remainder' is 0, 'sequence' is a list of 'k' integers where the first 'k - remainder' integers are 'd' times the corresponding integer from 1 to 'k - remainder', and the last 'remainder' integers are 'd' times the corresponding integer from 'k - remainder + 1' to 'k' plus 1, and 'i' is -1. If 'n' is equal to 'min_sum', 'remainder' is 0 and the loop does not execute, 'sequence' is a list of 'k' integers where each integer is 'd' times the corresponding integer from 1 to 'k'.**
