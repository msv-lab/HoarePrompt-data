The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and then updates the new value of `a` to be the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a` and `b`, we cannot determine their exact values after the execution. However, we can describe the relationship between the old and new values of `a` and `b`.

Let's denote the old values of `a` and `b` as `old_a` and `old_b`, respectively. After the execution, the new value of `a` is `old_a % old_b`, and the new value of `b` is `old_a`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `a` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, and `b` is the old value of `a`.**
