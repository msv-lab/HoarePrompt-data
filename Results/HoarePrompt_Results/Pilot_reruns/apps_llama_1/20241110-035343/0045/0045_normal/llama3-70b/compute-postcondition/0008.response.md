Let's break down the information step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Now, let's analyze the output:

There are two cases:

Case_1: If `b` is 0 initially, then `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function returns `a`.

Case_2: If `b` is non-zero initially, then `a` is the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, and the function returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.

Note that the values of `n` and `k` are mentioned in the parameter constraints, but they are not used in the function. Instead, the function uses `a` and `b`. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement, and `n` and `k` should be replaced with `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return either the original value of `a` if `b` is 0, or the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b` if `b` is non-zero.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, returns a if b is 0, otherwise returns the GCD of the original values of a and b.**
