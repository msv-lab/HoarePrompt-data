Correctness: **False**.

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks for a sequence of k positive numbers with a maximal greatest common divisor, but the code simply generates a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to k, without considering the greatest common divisor.

For example, when n = 8 and k = 2, the code outputs 1 7, but the correct output should be 2 6, which has a greater greatest common divisor.

The output hints do not provide any additional information that would suggest the code is correct. In fact, the output hints mention a function `func_1` that is not used in the code, which suggests that the code may be incomplete or incorrect.

The problem description also provides examples that the code does not handle correctly. For instance, when n = 5 and k = 3, the code outputs -1, but the correct output should be -1 because there is no sequence of 3 positive numbers that sums up to 5 and has a maximal greatest common divisor.

Overall, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
