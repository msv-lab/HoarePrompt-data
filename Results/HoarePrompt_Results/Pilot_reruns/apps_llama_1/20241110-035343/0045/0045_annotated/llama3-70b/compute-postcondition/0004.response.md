To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. `a, b = b, a % b`: This line of code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and also calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k <= n`. However, since the code snippet does not involve `n` and `k`, their values do not change.
- `a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` is the non-zero remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.

After executing the code:
- The new value of `a` becomes the original value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.

However, we are given that `b` is the non-zero remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. This implies that `a` and `b` are in a state where `b` is already the remainder of `a` divided by some previous value of `b`.

So, after the swap, `a` will hold the value that `b` had before the swap (which is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`), and `b` will hold the remainder of the original `a` divided by this new `a` (which is the original `b`).

This essentially means that `a` and `b` have swapped their roles, but the values they hold are still related to each other in the same way as before the swap.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k <= n`, `a` is the non-zero remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, and `b` is the original value of `a` (or the original `b` before the swap).**
