The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers such that `b` is less than or equal to `a`. 

After executing the function body, the function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`, while the output state is `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are positive integers such that b is less than or equal to a, and returns the GCD of a and b.**
