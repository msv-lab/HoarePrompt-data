To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the changes made to the variables in the previous iteration.

The loop condition is `i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. To ensure the loop executes again, `i` should be decremented by 1, making it `k - 3` or simply `i` is `k - 3`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the changes to `remainder` and the `sequence` list do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are multiples of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, and the last integer is one more than a multiple of `d`, but the integer at index `k - 2` is now one more than a multiple of `d`, `i` is `k - 3`, and `remainder` is decreased by 1**
