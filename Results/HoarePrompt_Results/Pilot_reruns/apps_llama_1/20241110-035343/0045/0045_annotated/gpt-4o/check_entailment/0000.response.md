Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the goal is to find a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal. However, the code does not guarantee that the sequence is strictly increasing.

The annotations mention that the sequence is a list of k integers, where each integer is a multiple of d plus an additional value that is at most k - 1 and at least 0, starting from the last element and decreasing by 1 for each element to the left. However, this does not ensure that the sequence is strictly increasing.

For example, if n = 10 and k = 3, the code will return the sequence [2, 3, 5]. However, this sequence is not strictly increasing because 2 + 3 + 5 = 10, but the greatest common divisor of the sequence is 1, which is not maximal. A strictly increasing sequence with a maximal greatest common divisor would be [1, 2, 7] or [1, 3, 6].

The annotations also mention that the remainder is distributed across the sequence list from right to left, but this does not guarantee that the sequence is strictly increasing. In fact, the code may produce a sequence that is not strictly increasing if the remainder is large enough.

The problem description also provides examples, and the code produces the correct output for these examples. However, this does not guarantee that the code is correct for all potential cases.

In conclusion, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore the correctness is False.
