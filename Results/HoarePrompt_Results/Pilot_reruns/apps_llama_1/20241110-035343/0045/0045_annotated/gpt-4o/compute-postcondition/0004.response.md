To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `d * min_sum`. We are given that `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2` and `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`.

Substituting the values of `min_sum` and `d` into the equation, we get:

`remainder = n - (n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)) * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`

Simplifying the equation, we can see that `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, `remainder` will be a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

The output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer less than `k * (k + 1) // 2**
