Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, and `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1; otherwise, no changes are made to `n`, `k`, or `min_sum`, maintaining their initial values and relationships.***

Note: Since there is no else part in the code, the postcondition includes the case where `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, implying that the function does not modify the variables in this case.
