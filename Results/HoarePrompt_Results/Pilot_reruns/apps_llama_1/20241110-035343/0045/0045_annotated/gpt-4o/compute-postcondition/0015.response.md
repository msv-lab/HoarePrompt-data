The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `remainder` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are multiples of `d`, starting from `d` and incrementing by `d`, and the last integer is one more than a multiple of `d`, but the integer at index `k - 2` is now one more than a multiple of `d`, `i` is `k - 2`, and `remainder` is decreased by 1.
