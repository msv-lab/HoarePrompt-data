To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that must be met before the loop starts. The loop iterates over a range of `m`, which means `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, since `i` is the loop counter, its initial value should be 0, as it will increment with each iteration.

State: **`r` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is a sorted list of stock prices, `b` is unchanged, `i` is 0**
