Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `r` is used to calculate `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as the sum of `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` and `remaining_bourles`, and the value of `total_bourles` is printed.***
