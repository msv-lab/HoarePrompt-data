Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible combinations of buying and selling shares. It only buys shares at the lowest price and sells them at the highest price, but it does not consider buying shares at a higher price and selling them at a lower price if it would result in a higher profit.

For example, if the input is:

3 3 100
10 20 30
40 30 20

The program will buy 10 shares at 10 bourles each and sell them at 40 bourles each, resulting in a profit of 300 bourles. However, it would be more profitable to buy 5 shares at 20 bourles each and sell them at 40 bourles each, resulting in a profit of 400 bourles.

The program should consider all possible combinations of buying and selling shares to find the maximum profit.
