Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the maximum sell price is greater than the minimum buy price, but the minimum buy price is not the best option to buy shares. The program only considers buying shares at the minimum price, but it does not consider buying shares at a higher price if it would result in a higher total number of bourles after selling.

For example, if the input is:

3 3 100
10 20 30
40 30 20

The program will buy shares at the price of 10 and sell them at the price of 40, resulting in a total of 340 bourles. However, it would be better to buy shares at the price of 20 and sell them at the price of 40, resulting in a total of 360 bourles.

The program does not consider this case and therefore does not always produce the correct output.
