The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values of three integers obtained from the input, where `input` accepts a string of space-separated integers and `map(int,...)` converts each integer to an integer. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected, so the output state is `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers, `s` is a list of n positive integers, and `b` is a list of m positive integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers, `s` is a list of n positive integers, and `b` is a list of m positive integers**
