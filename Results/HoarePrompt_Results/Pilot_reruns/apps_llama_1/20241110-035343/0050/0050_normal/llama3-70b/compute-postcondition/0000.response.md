The code snippet `n, m, r = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `r` based on the user's input.

The `input()` function accepts a line of input from the user, and the `split()` method splits this input into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter.

The `map(int,...)` function applies the `int()` function to each string in the list, converting them to integers.

The resulting integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `r`, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `r` is a positive integer, the new values assigned to these variables will also be positive integers.

The output state does not specify the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, as they depend on the user's input.

However, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `r` is an input positive integer, `s` is a list of `n` positive integers, and `b` is a list of `m` positive integers.**
