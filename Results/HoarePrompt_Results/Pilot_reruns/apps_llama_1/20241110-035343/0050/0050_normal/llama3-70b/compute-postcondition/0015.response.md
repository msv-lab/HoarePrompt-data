Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, and `i` is 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of the original `r` by `s[1]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of the original `r` divided by `s[1]`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is terminated, leaving `shares` and `r` unchanged. The state of `m`, `s`, `b`, and `i` remains unchanged in both cases.***
