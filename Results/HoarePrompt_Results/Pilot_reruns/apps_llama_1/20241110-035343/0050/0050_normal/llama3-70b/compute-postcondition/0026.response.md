The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0 or greater than 0, `shares` is 0 if `n` is 0, otherwise `shares` is the sum of the integer divisions of `r` by each element in `s` that is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is the remainder of the division of the original `r` by the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `r`, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
