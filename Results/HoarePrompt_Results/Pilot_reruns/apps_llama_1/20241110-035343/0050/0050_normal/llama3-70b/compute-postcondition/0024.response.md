To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is: `r += shares * b[i]`

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is 0 or greater than 0
- `shares` is 0 if `n` is 0, otherwise `shares` is the sum of the integer divisions of `r` by each element in `s` that is less than or equal to `r`
- `r` is the remainder of the division of the original `r` by the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `r`
- `m` is a positive integer
- `s` is a sorted list of input integers
- `b` is a list of input integers in descending order
- `i` is 0

The code affects the variable `r`. Since `i` is 0, `b[i]` is the first element in the list `b`, which is the largest element in `b` due to the descending order.

The new value of `r` is the sum of its current value and the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. 

Since the initial value of `r` is dependent on `n` and `s`, and `shares` is dependent on `n`, `r`, and `s`, the new value of `r` will be different based on the initial values of `n`, `r`, and `s`. However, we can express the new value of `r` as `r + shares * b[i]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `shares`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0 or greater than 0, `shares` is 0 if `n` is 0, otherwise `shares` is the sum of the integer divisions of the original `r` by each element in `s` that is less than or equal to the original `r`, `r` is the original `r` plus `shares` times the largest element in `b`, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0 or greater than 0, `shares` is 0 if `n` is 0, otherwise `shares` is the sum of the integer divisions of the original `r` by each element in `s` that is less than or equal to the original `r`, `r` is the original `r` plus `shares` times the largest element in `b`, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, and `i` is 0**
