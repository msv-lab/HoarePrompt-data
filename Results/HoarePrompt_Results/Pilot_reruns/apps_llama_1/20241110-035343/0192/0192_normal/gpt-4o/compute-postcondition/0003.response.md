Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, here is the functionality of the function:

The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input two integers `x` and `y` and calculates the absolute difference between them. The absolute difference is then printed as the output.

Note that the annotations mention that `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100000, but the code does not enforce these constraints. Therefore, the functionality summary does not include these constraints.

Functionality: ** The function prompts the user to input two integers, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. **
