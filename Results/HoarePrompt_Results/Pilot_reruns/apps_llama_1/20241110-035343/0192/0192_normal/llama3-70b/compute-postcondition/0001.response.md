The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, the absolute difference is also an integer. The state of the variables `x` and `y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed**
