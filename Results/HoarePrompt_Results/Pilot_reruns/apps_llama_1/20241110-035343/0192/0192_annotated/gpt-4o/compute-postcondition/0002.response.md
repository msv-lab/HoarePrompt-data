It seems like there is a mistake in the problem description. The function `func` is defined without any parameters, but the problem statement mentions parameters `x` and `y`. I will assume that the function should accept two parameters `x` and `y`.

The function `func` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100000. However, the output of the function is not provided. Please provide the output or return value of the function so I can complete the description of its functionality.
