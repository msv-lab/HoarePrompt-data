The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each input, converting them to integers. The `split` function splits the input into two values, which are then assigned to `x` and `y`.

Since the initial state already specifies that `x` and `y` are integers, the only change is that they are reassigned new values from the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers**
