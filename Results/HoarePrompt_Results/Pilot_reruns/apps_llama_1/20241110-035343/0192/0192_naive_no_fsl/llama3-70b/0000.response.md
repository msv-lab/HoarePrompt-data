Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x.

The issue with the program is that it simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is not necessarily the minimum number of seconds required. The problem statement allows for the modification of one side of the triangle at a time, and the program does not take into account the fact that the triangle must remain non-degenerate (i.e., have positive area) at all times.

For example, consider the case where x = 10 and y = 3. The program would output 7, but the correct answer is 8. The correct sequence of operations would be:

(10, 10, 10) → (10, 10, 3) → (10, 6, 3) → (10, 5, 3) → (6, 5, 3) → (5, 5, 3) → (5, 4, 3) → (4, 4, 3) → (4, 3, 3) → (3, 3, 3)

As you can see, the program's output of 7 is incorrect, and the correct answer is 8. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
