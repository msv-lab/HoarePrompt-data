To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0

Given Code:
```python
numerator *= total_days - i
```

Now, let's think step by step:

- The value of `i` is 0.
- The value of `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- The expression `total_days - i` will be equal to `total_days` because `i` is 0.
- The value of `numerator` is 1.
- The `*=` operator multiplies the value of `numerator` by the result of `total_days - i` and assigns it back to `numerator`.

Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `numerator *= total_days`. Therefore, the value of `numerator` will be equal to `total_days`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `denominator`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is equal to `total_days`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
