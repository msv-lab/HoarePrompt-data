`total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `k` is not affected. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `2 ** n` will be an integer greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2**
