To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(k):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `numerator` is 1
- `denominator` is 1

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Since `k` is already greater than or equal to 2, we just need to introduce the loop variable `i` and set it to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
