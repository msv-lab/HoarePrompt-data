The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2. After executing the function body, the function returns the remainder of the `numerator` divided by `10^k`. The `numerator` is calculated as the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`, divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the remainder of a calculated `numerator` divided by `10^k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, returns the remainder of a calculated numerator divided by 10^k.**
