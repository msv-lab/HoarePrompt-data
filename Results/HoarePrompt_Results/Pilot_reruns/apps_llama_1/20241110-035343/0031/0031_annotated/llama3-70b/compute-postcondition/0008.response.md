The code `denominator *= total_days` multiplies the value of `denominator` by `total_days` and assigns the result back to `denominator`. 

Initially, `denominator` is `total_days`, so after execution, `denominator` becomes `total_days * total_days`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1)`, `denominator` is `total_days * total_days`, and `i` is 1**
