The code `denominator //= gcd` performs integer division of `denominator` by `gcd` and assigns the result back to `denominator`. 

Given the initial state, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`. 

After the execution of the code, `denominator` is updated to be the result of the integer division of `total_days` raised to the power of `k` by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `k-1`, `numerator` is the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `k-1`, `numerator` is the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.**
