The code `denominator *= total_days` multiplies the value of `denominator` by `total_days` and assigns the result back to `denominator`. The initial state of `denominator` is 1 and `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. 

After the execution, the value of `denominator` will be `1 * total_days`, which is equal to `total_days`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is equal to `total_days`, `denominator` is equal to `total_days`, `i` is 0**
