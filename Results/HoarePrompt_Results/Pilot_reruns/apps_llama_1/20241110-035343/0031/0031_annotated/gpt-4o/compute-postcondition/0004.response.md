`total_days` is assigned the value `1 << n`, which is equivalent to 2 to the power of `n`. The value of `n` is an integer, but the specific value is unknown. The values of `k` and `MOD` are not affected by this statement. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`.**
