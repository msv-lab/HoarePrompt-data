According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
