To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
A = p_shared
```
The initial state is:
- `numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003
- `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003
- `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003
- `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003
- `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003

The code assigns the value of `p_shared` to a new variable `A`. This operation does not change the values of the existing variables.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003
- `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003
- `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003
- `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003
- `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003
- `A` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, which is the same value as `p_shared`

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_no_shared` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, `p_total` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003, `p_shared` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003, `A` is (`p_total` - `p_no_shared` + 1,000,003) modulo 1,000,003**
