The code defines a constant `MOD` and assigns it the value `10 ** 6 + 3`, which is equal to 1,000,003. This value is a prime number and is often used as a modulus in mathematical calculations.

The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code, as it only defines a new constant.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1,000,003**
