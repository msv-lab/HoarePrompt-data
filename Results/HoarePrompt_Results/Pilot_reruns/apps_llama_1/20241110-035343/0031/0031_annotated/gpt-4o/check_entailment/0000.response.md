Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when `k` is 1. According to the problem description, `k` is the number of people being interviewed, and it is guaranteed to be at least 2. However, the code does not explicitly handle this case. If `k` is 1, the loop in `func_2` will not execute, and `numerator` and `denominator` will remain 1, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case when `n` is 0. In this case, `total_days` will be 1, and the loop in `func_2` will not execute, which is incorrect.

The annotations mention that the function does not handle negative values of `n` or `k`, but this is not explicitly stated in the problem description. However, the problem description does guarantee that `n` and `k` are positive integers.

The code also does not handle the case when `func_1` returns 0, which could potentially cause a division by zero error.

Overall, while the code may work correctly for many cases, it does not handle all possible edge cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
