The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `(total_days - i)` and then taking the modulus of the result with `MOD`. 

The initial value of `numerator` is 2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, and `i` is 1. 

So, `(total_days - i)` is 2 to the power of `n` minus 1.

Therefore, `numerator` is updated to `(2 to the power of n modulo 1,000,003) * (2 to the power of n - 1) modulo 1,000,003`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is (2 to the power of n modulo 1,000,003) * (2 to the power of n - 1) modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003, `i` is 1**
