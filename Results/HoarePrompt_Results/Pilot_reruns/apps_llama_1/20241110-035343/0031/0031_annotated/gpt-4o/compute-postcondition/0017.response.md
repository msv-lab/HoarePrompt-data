Output State: **The loop calculates the numerator and denominator of a fraction where the numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for i from 0 to k-1, and the denominator is total_days raised to the power of k, both modulo MOD. If k is 0, the loop does not execute and numerator and denominator remain 1. After the loop executes, `numerator` is the product of (2 to the power of `n` - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo 1,000,003, and `denominator` is 2 to the power of (k * `n`), modulo 1,000,003. If k is greater than total_days, the numerator will be 0 because one of the terms in the product will be 0 (when i equals total_days). If k is greater than or equal to MOD, the results may not be accurate due to the modulo operation.**
