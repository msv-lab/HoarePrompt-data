Let's analyze the function `func_2` step by step:

The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2.

The function has two possible execution paths, which we can describe as two cases:

Case 1: If `k` is greater than 2 to the power of `n`, the function prints the tuple `(1, 1)` and returns. In this case, the function does not return any value, but rather prints a specific output and exits.

Case 2: If `k` is not greater than 2 to the power of `n`, the function continues execution without printing or returning. This implies that the function will proceed to execute further code, but the problem statement does not provide information on what this code does or what the function ultimately returns.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and based on the value of `k` relative to 2 to the power of `n`, either print `(1, 1)` and return, or continue execution without printing or returning.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and based on the value of `k` relative to 2 to the power of `n`, either prints `(1, 1)` and returns, or continues execution without printing or returning.**
