After analyzing the annotated code and the return postconditions, I can summarize the functionality of the function as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k` is greater than 2 to the power of `n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns without performing any further calculations. Otherwise, the function calculates the total number of days as 2 to the power of `n` and then calculates the numerator and denominator for the probability of shared birthdays. The function then calculates the probability of shared birthdays and the total probability, and finally prints the values of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD` (1000003) after dividing them by the return value of the function `func_1(A, B)`. However, since the function `func_1(A, B)` is not defined in the given code, the actual calculation of `A` and `B` is unknown. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `k` is 0 or 1, in which case the loop does not execute and the values of `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1. **
