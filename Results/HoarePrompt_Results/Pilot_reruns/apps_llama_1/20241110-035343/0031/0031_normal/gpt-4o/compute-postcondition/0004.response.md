To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code snippet is:
```
total_days = 1 << n
```
Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer >= 1
- `k` is an integer >= 2
- `MOD` is 1000003

The operation `1 << n` is a left shift operation, equivalent to `2^n`. This operation does not affect the values of `k` and `MOD`.

Since `n` is an integer >= 1, `total_days` will be assigned a value of `2^n`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, and `total_days` is `2^n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, and `total_days` is `2^n`.**
