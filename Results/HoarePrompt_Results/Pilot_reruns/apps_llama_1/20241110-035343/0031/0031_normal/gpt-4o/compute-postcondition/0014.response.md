To calculate the new value of `numerator`, we need to understand the initial state and the operation being performed.

Given:
- `n` is an integer >= 1
- `k` is an integer >= 2
- `MOD` is 1000003
- `total_days` is `2^n`
- `numerator` is ((`2^n` % 1000003) * (`2^n` - 1)) % 1000003
- `denominator` is (`2^n` % 1000003) * `2^n` % 1000003
- `i` is 2

The operation is: `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`

First, calculate `total_days - i`:
- `total_days - i` = `2^n` - 2

Then, multiply this by `numerator` and take the modulus `MOD`:
- `numerator` = (((`2^n` % 1000003) * (`2^n` - 1)) % 1000003) * (`2^n` - 2) % 1000003

The exact value of `numerator` after this operation depends on the value of `n`, but we can express the output state in terms of the variables and operations performed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is (((`2^n` % 1000003) * (`2^n` - 1)) % 1000003) * (`2^n` - 2) % 1000003, `denominator` is (`2^n` % 1000003) * `2^n` % 1000003, `i` is 2**
