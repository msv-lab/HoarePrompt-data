According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `k` is already given as an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute. However, to make the state more precise, we can add the state of `i`, which will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
