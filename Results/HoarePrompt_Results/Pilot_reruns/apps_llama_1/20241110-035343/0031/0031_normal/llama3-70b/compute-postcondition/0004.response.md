To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.


The code snippet is `numerator *= total_days - i`. 


Initially, `numerator` is 1, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, and `i` is 0.


So, `total_days - i` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n` - 0, which is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`.


Now, `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`, so the new value of `numerator` is 1 * 2 raised to the power of `n`, which is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`.


The values of the other variables are not affected.


Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
