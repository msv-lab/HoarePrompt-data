To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is `i in range(k)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 1**
