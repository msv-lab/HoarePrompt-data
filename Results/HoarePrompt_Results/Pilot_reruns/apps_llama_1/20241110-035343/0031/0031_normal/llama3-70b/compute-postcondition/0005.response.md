To solve this problem, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18
- `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`
- `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`
- `denominator` is 1
- `i` is 0

The given code is:
```python
denominator *= total_days
```
Now, let's think step by step:

- The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`.
- The previous value of `denominator` is 1.
- The value of `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.

After execution, the value of `denominator` becomes `1 * 2^n`, which is equal to `2^n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 0**
