The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 10^18` and `2 <= k <= 10^18`. It calculates the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` and `2` raised to the power of `n*k`, and then divides both by their greatest common divisor. The function returns a tuple containing the result of these calculations modulo `10^6 + 3`. However, the code does not handle the case where `k` is 0, which would result in a division by zero error when calculating the greatest common divisor. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where `n` is 0, which would result in a product of 1 for the numerator. The code also assumes that the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` and `2` raised to the power of `n*k` will not exceed the maximum limit of an integer, which may not always be the case.
