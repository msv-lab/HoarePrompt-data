Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the voting procedure described in the problem. The program simply counts the number of depublicans and remocrats and declares the fraction with the majority as the winner. However, the problem states that the voting procedure is more complex, with employees being able to deny the right to vote to other employees, and the process repeating until only one employee remains.

A counterexample is the input "5 DDRRR". The program would output "R", but according to the problem description, the correct output is "D". This is because the first employee can deny the right to vote to the last employee, and then the second employee can deny the right to vote to the third employee, leaving only the first employee, who is a depublican, to determine the outcome of the vote.

The program does not take into account the order of the employees, the ability to deny the right to vote, and the repeated process of voting, which are all crucial aspects of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
