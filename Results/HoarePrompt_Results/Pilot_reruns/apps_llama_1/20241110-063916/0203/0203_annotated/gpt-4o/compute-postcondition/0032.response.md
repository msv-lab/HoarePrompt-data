The value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. The value of `d_index` is the same as before (the first element that was in `d_queue`), but the actual value is unknown. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but its actual value is also unknown. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has at least one less element and then one more element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the same as before (the first element that was in `d_queue`), `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least one less element and then one more element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the same as before (the first element that was in `d_queue`), `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
