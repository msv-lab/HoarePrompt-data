Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has its first element removed and either `d_index + n` appended if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, or remains unchanged if `d_index` is not less than `r_index`. `r_queue` has its first element removed and either remains unchanged if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, or has `r_index + n` appended if `d_index` is not less than `r_index`. `d_index` remains the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string, `r_index` remains the index of a non-'D' character, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged.***
