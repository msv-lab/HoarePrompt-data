The code appends the value `d_index + n` to the end of the `d_queue` list. The initial state of `d_queue` is that it has at least one element, and `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

After executing the code, the `d_queue` list will have a new element appended to the end, which is the sum of `d_index` and `n`. The other variables, `r_queue`, `r_index`, `i`, `v`, and `n`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least two elements with the last element being `d_index + n`, `r_queue` has at least no element, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the new first element that was in `r_queue`, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
