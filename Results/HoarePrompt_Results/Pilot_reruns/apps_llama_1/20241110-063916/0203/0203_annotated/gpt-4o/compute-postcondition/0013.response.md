Let's break down the code step by step.

The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. 

Since `i` is 2, the value 2 will be appended to the `d_queue` list.

Now, let's consider the possible initial states of `d_queue`:

1. If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is a list containing [0, 1, 2]. After appending 2, `d_queue` becomes [0, 1, 2, 2].
2. If `v` is not 'D', there are three possibilities:
   a. `d_queue` is a list containing [1, 2]. After appending 2, `d_queue` becomes [1, 2, 2].
   b. `d_queue` is a list containing [1, 2] and `r_queue` is a list containing [0, 1]. After appending 2, `d_queue` becomes [1, 2, 2].
   c. `d_queue` is a list containing [2] and `r_queue` is a list containing [0, 1]. After appending 2, `d_queue` becomes [2, 2].

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `votes` is a new input string with at least 3 characters
- `i` is 2
- `v` is the third character in the `votes` string
- If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is [0, 1, 2, 2] and `r_queue` is an empty list.
- If `v` is not 'D', `d_queue` is either [1, 2, 2] or [2, 2] and `r_queue` is either an empty list, [0], or [0, 1].

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character in the `votes` string, `d_queue` is either [0, 1, 2, 2] or [1, 2, 2] or [2, 2], and `r_queue` is either an empty list, [0], or [0, 1]**
