To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.


The code snippet is: `r_queue.append(r_index + n)`. This line of code appends the sum of `r_index` and `n` to the `r_queue`.


From the initial state, we know that `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character and `n` remains unchanged. However, we do not know the exact value of `n` or `r_index`. Since `r_queue` had its first element removed, it now has a new first element, but we do not know its value. 


After executing the code snippet, `r_queue` will have the sum of `r_index` and `n` appended to it. The values of the other variables (`d_queue`, `d_index`, `i`, and `v`) remain unchanged.


Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has the first element removed, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` has the first element removed and `r_index + n` appended to it, `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character, `i` is the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` is the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged.


Output State: **`d_queue` has the first element removed, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` has the first element removed and `r_index + n` appended to it, `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character, `i` is the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` is the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
