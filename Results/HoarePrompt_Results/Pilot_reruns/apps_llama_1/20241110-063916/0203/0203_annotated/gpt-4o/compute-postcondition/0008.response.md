To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop condition and the variables involved.

The loop iterates over the `votes` string using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the character `v` at that index.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first character in the `votes` string. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented, and `v` must be the next character in the string.

Since `votes` has at least 1 character, we know that it has at least 2 characters for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `votes` to reflect that it has at least 2 characters.

Additionally, `i` should be incremented to 1, and `v` should be the second character in the `votes` string.

The states of `n`, `d_queue`, and `r_queue` do not depend on the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in the `votes` string. If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and `r_queue` is an empty list. Otherwise, `d_queue` is an empty list and `r_queue` is a list containing 0.**
