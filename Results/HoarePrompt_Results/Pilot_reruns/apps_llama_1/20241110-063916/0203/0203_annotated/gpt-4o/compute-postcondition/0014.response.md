To determine the output state, we'll analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables based on the initial state.

The code snippet is: `r_queue.append(i)`

Given that `i` is 2, this operation will append the value 2 to the `r_queue` list.

The initial state of `r_queue` depends on the value of `v`, which is the third character in the `votes` string. 

1. If `v` is 'D', `r_queue` is an empty list. After appending `i` (which is 2), `r_queue` will be `[2]`.

2. If `v` is not 'D', there are three possible initial states for `r_queue`:
   - `r_queue` is a list containing `[0]`. After appending `i` (which is 2), `r_queue` will be `[0, 2]`.
   - `r_queue` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. After appending `i` (which is 2), `r_queue` will be `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - `r_queue` is a list containing `[0, 1]` or `[0]` if the previous value of `v` was 'D' and `d_queue` is a list containing `[2]`. After appending `i` (which is 2), `r_queue` will be `[0, 1, 2]` or `[0, 2]`.

The other variables (`n`, `votes`, `i`, `v`, and `d_queue`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character in the `votes` string, `d_queue` is as initially described based on `v`, and `r_queue` is either `[2]` if `v` is 'D', or `[0, 2]`, `[0, 1, 2]`, or `[0, 2]` if `v` is not 'D'.**
