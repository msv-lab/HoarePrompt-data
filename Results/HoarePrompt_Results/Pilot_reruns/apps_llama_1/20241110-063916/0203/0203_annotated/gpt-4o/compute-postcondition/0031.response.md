The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` had at least one element, `r_index` will now hold the value of the removed element.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the same as before (the first element that was in `d_queue`), `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
