The code `print('R')` prints the string 'R' to the console. This statement does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional effect of printing 'R' to the console.

Output State: **`depublicans` is the number of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the number of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', `n` remains unchanged, and 'R' is printed to the console**
