To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for fraction in fractions:`, which means the loop will iterate over each character in the `fractions` string.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an input integer
* `fractions` is a non-empty input string
* `fraction` is the first character in the string
* If the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0. Otherwise, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 1.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state as follows:

* `fractions` should still be a non-empty string, but with the first character removed.
* `fraction` should be the next character in the string.
* `n` remains unchanged.
* `depublicans` and `remocrats` values depend on the new value of `fraction`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `fractions` or `fraction`, we can't determine the exact values of `depublicans` and `remocrats`. However, we can express the state in terms of the new value of `fraction`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with the first character removed, `fraction` is the next character in the string. If the next character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0. Otherwise, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 1.**
