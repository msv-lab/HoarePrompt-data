The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and other characters in `fractions` and prints 'D' if 'D' characters are more than other characters, and 'R' otherwise. However, it does not handle cases where `fractions` contains characters other than 'D' and 'R', or where `fractions` is not of length `n`, and it does not provide a tie message when 'D' and other characters are equal.
