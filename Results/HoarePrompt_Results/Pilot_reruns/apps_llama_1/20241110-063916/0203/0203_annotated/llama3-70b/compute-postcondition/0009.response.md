To calculate the output state, let's consider the possible values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` based on the initial state.

Since `depublicans` is either 0 or 1 and `remocrats` is either 0 or 1, depending on the next character in the string `fractions`, the initial state is:

- If the next character in `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0.
- Otherwise, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 1.

Now, let's execute the code `depublicans += 1`.

- If `depublicans` is 1 (next character in `fractions` is 'D'), then `depublicans` becomes 2.
- If `depublicans` is 0 (next character in `fractions` is not 'D'), then `depublicans` becomes 1.

The state of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, `fraction`, and `remocrats`) is not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `fractions` is a non-empty input string with the first character removed
- `fraction` is the next character in the string
- If the next character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is 2 and `remocrats` is 0
- Otherwise, `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 1

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with the first character removed, `fraction` is the next character in the string, `depublicans` is either 1 or 2, and `remocrats` is either 0 or 1**
