To calculate the output state, let's consider the initial state and the given Python code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `fractions` is a non-empty input string with the first character removed
- `fraction` is the next character in the string
- If the next character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0
- Otherwise, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 1

Given Python Code:
```python
remocrats += 1
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1.
2. The initial value of `remocrats` depends on the next character of `fractions`. If it's 'D', `remocrats` is 0; otherwise, `remocrats` is 1.
3. If `remocrats` is 0 (when the next character of `fractions` is 'D'), incrementing it by 1 makes it 1.
4. If `remocrats` is 1 (when the next character of `fractions` is not 'D'), incrementing it by 1 makes it 2.
5. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, `fraction`, and `depublicans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Considering the above steps, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `fractions` is a non-empty input string with the first character removed
- `fraction` is the next character in the string
- If the next character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 1
- Otherwise, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 2

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with the first character removed, `fraction` is the next character in the string, `depublicans` is either 0 or 1, and `remocrats` is either 1 or 2**
