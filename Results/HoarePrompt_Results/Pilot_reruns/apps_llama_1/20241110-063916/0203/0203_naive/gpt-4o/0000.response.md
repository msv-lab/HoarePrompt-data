Correctness: **True**

The program correctly simulates the voting process and determines the outcome based on the optimal strategy of the employees. The key insight is that the employees can deny the voting rights of others in a way that allows them to control the outcome.

The program uses two queues, `d_queue` and `r_queue`, to keep track of the employees from the two fractions. It iteratively removes the front elements from both queues and denies the voting rights of the employee from the other fraction. If the employee from the first fraction has a lower index, it adds the index of the employee from the first fraction plus `n` to the end of its queue, effectively allowing it to participate in the next round. Otherwise, it adds the index of the employee from the second fraction plus `n` to the end of its queue.

The program continues this process until one of the queues is empty, at which point it prints the outcome of the vote based on the non-empty queue.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided. It is worth noting that the program assumes that the employees behave optimally, as stated in the problem description. If the employees do not behave optimally, the program may not produce the correct outcome.

Overall, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all possible inputs.
