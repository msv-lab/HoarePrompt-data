To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `d_queue and r_queue`. This means that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` must be non-empty for the loop to continue.

From the given state, we know that:

* `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index`, and possibly `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`.
* `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index`, and possibly `r_index + n` if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.

To ensure that both queues are non-empty, we need to adjust the states as follows:

* `d_queue` must contain at least one more index of a 'D' character in `votes`. This means that there must be at least one more 'D' character in `votes` that has not been processed yet.
* `r_queue` must contain at least one more index of a non-'D' character in `votes`. This means that there must be at least one more non-'D' character in `votes` that has not been processed yet.

Based on these requirements, the adjusted states are:

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`, `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least one more 'D' character, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index` and at least one more non-'D' character**
