The value of `d_queue` is modified by appending a new element, which is the sum of `d_index` and `n`. The values of `n`, `i`, `v`, `d_index`, and `r_index` are not affected, and `r_queue` has already had its first element removed.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the removed first element from `r_queue`, `r_queue` has its first element removed, and `d_queue` has a new element appended which is `d_index + n`.**
