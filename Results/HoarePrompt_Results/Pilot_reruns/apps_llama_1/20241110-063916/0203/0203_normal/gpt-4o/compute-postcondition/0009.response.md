The value of `i` is appended to `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 1. 

If the first character in `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` initially contains 0 and after execution, it will contain 0 and 1. `r_queue` remains an empty list.

If the first character in `votes` is not 'D', then `d_queue` initially is an empty list and after execution, it will contain 1. `r_queue` remains a list containing 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in `votes`. If the first character in `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and 1, and `r_queue` is an empty list. Otherwise, `d_queue` is a list containing 1, and `r_queue` is a list containing 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in `votes`. If the first character in `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and 1, and `r_queue` is an empty list. Otherwise, `d_queue` is a list containing 1, and `r_queue` is a list containing 0.**
