Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `r_queue` has its first element removed. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has a new element appended which is `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has a new element appended which is `r_index + n`.***
