Let's analyze the code step by step:

* The code `r_queue.append(r_index + n)` appends a new element to the `r_queue` list.
* The new element is the sum of `r_index` and `n`.
* Since `n` remains unchanged, its value is still unknown.
* `r_index` is the index of the next non-'D' character in `votes`.
* The value of `r_index + n` is unknown, but it is appended to the `r_queue` list.

Considering the initial state, the output state is:

* `n` remains unchanged
* `i` is still the index of the last character in `votes`
* `v` is still the last character in `votes`
* `d_index` is still the index of the next 'D' character in `votes`
* `r_index` is still the index of the next non-'D' character in `votes`
* `d_queue` still contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least one more 'D' character
* `r_queue` now contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index`, has one less element, and a new element `r_index + n` is appended to it

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the index of the next 'D' character in `votes`, `r_index` is the index of the next non-'D' character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least one more 'D' character, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index`, has one less element, and a new element `r_index + n` is appended to it**
