The function prompts the user to input an integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of 'D's and 'R's. It then compares the indices of 'D' and non-'D' characters in the `votes` string and prints 'D' if the index of the last 'D' character is less than the index of the last non-'D' character plus `n`, and 'R' otherwise. If the input `n` is 0 or the input `votes` is empty, the function does not print anything.
