Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`. If `d_queue` and `r_queue` are initially empty, they remain empty. If `d_queue` and `r_queue` are initially non-empty, the loop continues until one of the queues becomes empty. When the loop ends, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes` that are less than the indices of non-'D' characters in `votes` plus `n`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of non-'D' characters in `votes` that are greater than or equal to the indices of 'D' characters in `votes` plus `n`. If `d_queue` is empty, it means all 'D' characters in `votes` have indices less than the indices of non-'D' characters in `votes` plus `n`. If `r_queue` is empty, it means all non-'D' characters in `votes` have indices greater than or equal to the indices of 'D' characters in `votes` plus `n`. If `d_queue` is not empty, 'D' has been printed to the console; otherwise, 'R' has been printed to the console.***
