Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the index of the next 'D' character in `votes`, `r_index` is the index of the next non-'D' character in `votes`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least two more 'D' characters, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index` and has one less element. Otherwise, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and at least one more 'D' character, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index`, has one less element, and a new element `r_index + n` is appended to it.***
