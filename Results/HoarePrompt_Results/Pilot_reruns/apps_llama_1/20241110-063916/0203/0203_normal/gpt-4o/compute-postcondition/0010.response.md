Let's analyze the given code.

The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of the `r_queue` list. 

From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1, and `r_queue` is either an empty list or a list containing 0, depending on the first character of the `votes` string.

If the first character of `votes` is 'D', then `r_queue` is an empty list, so appending `i` (which is 1) will result in `r_queue` becoming a list containing 1.

If the first character of `votes` is not 'D', then `r_queue` is a list containing 0, so appending `i` (which is 1) will result in `r_queue` becoming a list containing 0 and 1.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in `votes`, `d_queue` is either a list containing 0 or an empty list, and `r_queue` is either a list containing 1 or a list containing 0 and 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in `votes`, `d_queue` is either a list containing 0 or an empty list, and `r_queue` is either a list containing 1 or a list containing 0 and 1.**
