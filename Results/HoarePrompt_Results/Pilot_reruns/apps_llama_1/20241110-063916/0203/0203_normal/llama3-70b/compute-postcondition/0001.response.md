The code `fractions = input()` assigns a new value to the variable `fractions`, which is the input provided by the user. The previous value of `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of only 'D' and 'R' characters, but this value is overwritten by the new input.

The value of `n` is not affected by this code, as it is not used or modified in any way.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string**
