Postcondition: ***The input string `fractions` is processed, and the counts of 'D' characters (`depublicans`) and non-'D' characters (`remocrats`) are updated accordingly. If `fractions` is empty, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the string 'D' is printed; otherwise, the string 'R' is printed, indicating the dominant character type in `fractions` or the result of the comparison between `depublicans` and `remocrats`.***
