The code `n, x = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `n` and `x`. The `input()` function accepts a string input, `split()` splits the string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and `map(int,...)` converts each substring to an integer. The resulting integers are then assigned to `n` and `x`, respectively.

The initial state of `n` is a positive integer, but its value is overwritten by the new input. Similarly, the initial state of `x` is an integer, but its value is also overwritten.

The variables `T` and `s` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0's and '1's**
