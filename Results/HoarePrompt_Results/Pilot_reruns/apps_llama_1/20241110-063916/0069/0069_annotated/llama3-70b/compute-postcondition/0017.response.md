The `print(-1)` statement prints the value -1, but it does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional effect that the value -1 is printed.

Output State: **`T` is at least 2, `n` is a new input integer, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, and the value -1 is printed.**
