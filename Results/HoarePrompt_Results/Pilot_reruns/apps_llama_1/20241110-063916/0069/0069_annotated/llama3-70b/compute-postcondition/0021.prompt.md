You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *T is at least 2, n is an integer, x is an integer, s is a string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in string s, and balance is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in the string s. If balance equals x, the program prints n + 1. If balance does not equal x and (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the integer result of (x - balance) divided by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1. In all cases, the values of T, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, and balance remain unchanged. Additionally, if cnt0 equals cnt1, the program will always print -1 because (x - balance) will always be divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), which is zero. If (cnt0 - cnt1) is zero but (x - balance) is not zero, the program will still print -1 due to the integer division by zero being undefined, but in this case, the condition (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0 will evaluate to True because the remainder of any number divided by zero is undefined but in this context it is considered as zero, hence -1 is printed.
```
for _ in range(T):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
