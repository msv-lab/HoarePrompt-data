Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance)` is a multiple of `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the program prints -1. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance)` is not a multiple of `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the program prints the integer division of `(x - balance)` by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` plus 1, provided that `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is not zero. If `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is zero, the program's behavior is undefined due to division by zero.***
