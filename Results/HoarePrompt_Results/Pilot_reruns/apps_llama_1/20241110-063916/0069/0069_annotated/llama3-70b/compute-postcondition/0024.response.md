`cnt0` is assigned the value of the count of '0' in the string `s`, and `cnt1` is assigned the value of the count of '1' in the string `s`. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` are not affected. The value of `balance` is still unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is at least 3, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is unknown.

Output State: **`T` is at least 3, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is unknown**
