Postcondition: ***`T`, `x`, `s`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged, `i` is `n`, `balance` remains the difference between the number of '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains at least two cumulative balances of '0's and '1's in `s`, `b` is the second cumulative balance in `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `count` remains 0.***
