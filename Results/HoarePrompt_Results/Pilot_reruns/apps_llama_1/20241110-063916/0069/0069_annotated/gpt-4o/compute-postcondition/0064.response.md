Postcondition: ***`T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged; `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with at least three elements; `n` is at least 1 or `data[index]` is at least 0; `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b)` is a multiple of `balance` and `(x - b)` is non-negative, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
