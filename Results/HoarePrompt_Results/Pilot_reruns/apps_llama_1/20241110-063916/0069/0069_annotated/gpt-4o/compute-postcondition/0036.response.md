Postcondition: ***The values of `T`, `x`, `s`, `data`, `input`, `index`, and `_` remain unchanged. If `balance` is 0, then if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, the `results` list contains an additional element `-1`, otherwise the `results` list has an additional element `0` appended to it. If `balance` is not 0, then `n` is either 0 or greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or `n`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balances of '0's and '1's in `s`, and `results` contains the count of cumulative balances that meet the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0`.***
