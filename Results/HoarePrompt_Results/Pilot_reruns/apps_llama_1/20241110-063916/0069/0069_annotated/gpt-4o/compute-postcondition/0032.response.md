Postcondition: ***`T`, `x`, `s`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged, `i` is `n`, `balance` remains the difference between the number of '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains at least three cumulative balances of '0's and '1's in `s`, `b` is the third cumulative balance in `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is either 1 or 2 before the if statement and either 2 or 3 after the if statement, otherwise `count` remains 0 before the if statement and becomes 1 after the if statement.***
