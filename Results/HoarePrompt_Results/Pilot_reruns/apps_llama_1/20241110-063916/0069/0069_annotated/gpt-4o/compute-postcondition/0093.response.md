Postcondition: ***`T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `results`, `s`, `n`, `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, `i`, `_` are unchanged. `count` is 2 if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, where `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`, otherwise `count` remains 1.***
