`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is 1, so `index + 2` is 3. Therefore, `s` is assigned the value of the fourth element in the `data` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, `x` is the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, `s` is the fourth element in the `data` list, `data` is a list of words read from the standard input with the first word removed, `input` is the remaining contents of the standard input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
