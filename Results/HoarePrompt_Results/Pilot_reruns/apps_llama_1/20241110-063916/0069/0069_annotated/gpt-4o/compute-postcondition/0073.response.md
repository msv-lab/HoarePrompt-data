`index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but it is used to calculate the values of `x`, `n`, and `s`. The new value of `index` will be used to calculate the values of `x`, `n`, and `s` in the future, but their current values remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` is incremented by 3, `x` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 2]`.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` is incremented by 3, `x` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 2]`.**
