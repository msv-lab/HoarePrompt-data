The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and `count` is initially 0, so the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `data`, `input`, `index`, `x`, `balance`, `i`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged; `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list; `count` is 1; `n` is at least 1 or `data[index]` is at least 0; `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`.
