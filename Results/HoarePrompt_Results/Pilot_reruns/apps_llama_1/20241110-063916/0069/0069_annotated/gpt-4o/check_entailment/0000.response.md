Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input string `s` is empty, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description but can be inferred from the fact that `n` can be 1. In this case, the code will throw an error when trying to access `s[i - 1]` in the line `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. 

Additionally, the code assumes that the input is well-formed and does not handle edge cases such as non-positive integers, malformed input, or missing input. For example, if `n` is not a positive integer, the code will not work correctly.

The annotations were helpful in understanding the code, but they did not mention the case where the input string `s` is empty. They did mention that the code reads the entire contents of the standard input, which may not be desirable in all cases, but this is not directly related to the correctness of the code.

The problem description provides examples of inputs and expected outputs, but it does not explicitly mention the case where the input string `s` is empty. However, based on the problem description, it can be inferred that the code should be able to handle this case.

Overall, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
