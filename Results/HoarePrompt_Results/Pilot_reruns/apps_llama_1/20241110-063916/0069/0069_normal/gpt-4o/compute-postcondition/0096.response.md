Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `prefix_balances` list has at least three elements, `i` is equal to `n`, `T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, and `balance` remain unchanged, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
