`index` is increased by 3. The previous value of `index` was already increased by 3, so now it is increased by another 3, making it increased by 6 in total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1 - 3]`, `data` remains unchanged and has at least 4 elements, `index` is increased by 6, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2 - 3]`, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 3 - 3]`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1 - 3]`, `data` remains unchanged and has at least 4 elements, `index` is increased by 6, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2 - 3]`, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 3 - 3]`.**
