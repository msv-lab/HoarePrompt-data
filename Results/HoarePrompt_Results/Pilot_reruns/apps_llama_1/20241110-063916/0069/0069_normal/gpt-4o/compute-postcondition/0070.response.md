`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `index` has been increased by 3, and `data` remains unchanged and has at least 4 elements. Therefore, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, which is now `data[index + 3]`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged and has at least 4 elements, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged and has at least 4 elements, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.**
