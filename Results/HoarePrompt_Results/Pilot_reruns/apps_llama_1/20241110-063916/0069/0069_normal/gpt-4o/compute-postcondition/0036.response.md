Postcondition: ***The values of `T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `prefix_balances`, `i`, and `balance` remain unchanged. The `results` list is updated. If `balance` is 0, `results` is appended with -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise it is appended with 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` is appended with the count of elements `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`.***
