The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`. The previous values of `data` and `index` are unchanged, so the value of `n` is determined by the value of `data` at the position specified by `index`. The values of `T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, `s`, `prefix_balances`, `i`, and `balance` are not affected, and the state of the `results` list remains updated. The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but it is still less than `T`. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` remains unchanged, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `balance` remains unchanged, and the `results` list is updated.**
