`index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so the new value of `index` is 1 + 3 = 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring at index 1 in the `data` list, `x` is the integer value of the substring at index 2 in the `data` list, `s` is the substring at index 3 in the `data` list, `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is any value.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring at index 1 in the `data` list, `x` is the integer value of the substring at index 2 in the `data` list, `s` is the substring at index 3 in the `data` list, `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is any value**
