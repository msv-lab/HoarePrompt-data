Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n is an integer, x is an integer, s is a string, _ is 2, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, and balance is cnt0 - cnt1. If (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the integer division of (x - balance) by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1, handling the case where cnt0 equals cnt1 by not attempting division by zero and instead printing a value based on x and balance.***
