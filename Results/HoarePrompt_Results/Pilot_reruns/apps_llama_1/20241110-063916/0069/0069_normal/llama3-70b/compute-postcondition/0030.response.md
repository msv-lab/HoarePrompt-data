Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n is an integer, x is an integer, s is a string, _ is 2, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, and balance is cnt0 - cnt1. If balance equals x, the program prints n + 1. If balance does not equal x but (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the program prints -1. Otherwise, if cnt0 is not equal to cnt1, the program prints the integer division of (x - balance) by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1. If cnt0 equals cnt1, the program prints x - balance + 1, since (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) would be undefined due to division by zero.***
