Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the balance of the string s is 0 and x is not equal to 0. In this case, the program will print -1, but it should print 0, because there are no prefixes of t with balance equal to x.

For example, if the input is:

2 0
01

The program will print -1, but the correct output is 0, because there are no prefixes of the infinite string t with balance equal to 0.

Also, the program does not correctly handle the case when the balance of the string s is not equal to 0 and x is equal to 0. In this case, the program will print n + 1, but it should print 0 or -1, depending on whether the balance of the string s is positive or negative.

For example, if the input is:

2 0
10

The program will print 3, but the correct output is 0, because there are no prefixes of the infinite string t with balance equal to 0.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
