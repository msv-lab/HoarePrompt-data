Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when Edward needs to move between floors within the same block. According to the problem description, Edward can move between floors within the same block instantly, but the program always adds a time penalty of 10 seconds for using the elevator, even if the floors are in the same block.

For example, if Edward lives in block 1 on floor 3 and Natasha lives in block 1 on floor 5, the program will calculate the time as if Edward needs to use the elevator to move between floors, which is not necessary. The correct time should be only the time to move between blocks, which is 0 seconds in this case.

To fix this, the program should check if the floors are in the same block before adding the time penalty for using the elevator.
