The function returns the values of `block` and `floor`. The initial state specifies that `block` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`. The other variables are not affected by the return statement. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n*m*k and a ≠ b, `block` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `floor_within_block` is an integer between 0 and `m * k - 1`, `floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, and the function returns `block` and `floor`.**
