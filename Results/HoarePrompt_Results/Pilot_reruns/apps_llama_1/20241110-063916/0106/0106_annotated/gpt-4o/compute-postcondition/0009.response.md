Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
```
From the initial state, we know that:
- `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b
- `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of `a`
- `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of `b`
- `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1
- `direct_walk_time` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15
- `reverse_walk_time` is an integer equal to (n - absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`) modulo `n` multiplied by 15
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`
- `time_to_target_floor` is an integer multiple of 5

The code calculates the `total_time` by adding `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

Since `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, and `time_to_target_floor` is an integer multiple of 5, the sum of `time_to_exit` and `time_to_target_floor` will be an integer.

`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, which are both integers. Therefore, `min_walk_time` is also an integer.

The sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` will be an integer.

The output state is:
- `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b
- `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of `a`
- `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of `b`
- `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1
- `direct_walk_time` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15
- `reverse_walk_time` is an integer equal to (n - absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`) modulo `n` multiplied by 15
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`
- `time_to_target_floor` is an integer multiple of 5
- `total_time` is an integer equal to the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of `b`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `reverse_walk_time` is an integer equal to (n - absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`) modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is an integer multiple of 5, and `total_time` is an integer equal to the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.**
