Let's analyze the given code.

The code is calculating the `block` variable based on the `apartment` variable. However, the initial state mentions variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, but not `apartment`. Since `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n*m*k, it can be assumed that `apartment` is either `a` or `b`.

Let's consider both cases:

Case 1: `apartment` is `a`
The value of `block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. Since `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n*m*k, the value of `block` will be an integer between 1 and `n`.

Case 2: `apartment` is `b`
The value of `block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. Since `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n*m*k, the value of `block` will be an integer between 1 and `n`.

In both cases, the value of `block` is an integer between 1 and `n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not changed.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n*m*k and a ≠ b, and `block` is an integer between 1 and `n`.**
