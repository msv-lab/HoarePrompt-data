`time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The value of `floor_b` is an integer based on the location of `b`, but its exact value is unknown. Therefore, the value of `time_to_target_floor` is an integer multiple of 5, but its exact value is also unknown.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of `b`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `reverse_walk_time` is an integer equal to (n - absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`) modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is an integer multiple of 5.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of `b`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `reverse_walk_time` is an integer equal to (n - absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`) modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is an integer multiple of 5**
