To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`.

The code snippet is:
```python
a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

Now, let's calculate the output state:

- The value of `a_block` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `a`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `a_floor` are not changed by the code snippet.
- The state of `a_block` is now determined by the values of `a`, `m`, and `k`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
- `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
