Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code defines a new variable `b_floor` and assigns it a value based on the input integer `b`. The value of `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.

Since `m` is an input integer, its value is unknown, but we can express the value of `b_floor` in terms of `b` and `m`.

The output state is:

* `n` is an input integer (no change)
* `m` is an input integer (no change)
* `k` is an input integer (no change)
* `a` is an input integer (no change)
* `b` is an input integer (no change)
* `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1` (no change)
* `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` (no change)
* `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1` (new variable)

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`**
