Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The code does not correctly calculate the minimum time it takes to move between the blocks and floors of the two rooms.

One edge case that the code does not handle is when the two rooms are in the same block but on different floors. In this case, the code calculates the minimum block time as 0, but it does not take into account the time it takes to move between the floors.

For example, if the input is (4, 10, 5), (200, 6), the code calculates the minimum block time as 0, but it does not calculate the time it takes to move from floor 10 to floor 2 in the same block.

Another issue is that the code always adds 10 seconds to the minimum floor time, which is the time it takes for the elevator to arrive. However, this is not necessary if the rooms are on the same floor.

The output hints agree with the code, but they do not provide any examples that demonstrate these edge cases.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to handle the case where the two rooms are in the same block but on different floors, and to only add the elevator arrival time when necessary.
