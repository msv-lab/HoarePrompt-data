To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state of the variables.

The code calculates `min_block_time` using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. 

We know that `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated based on input integers `a`, `b`, `m`, and `k`, but their exact values are not provided. However, we can still express the output state in terms of the given variables.

The `min` function returns the minimum of the two arguments. The first argument is the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, and the second argument is `n` minus the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`. This value is then multiplied by 15.

Since we don't know the exact values of `a_block` and `b_block`, we can't calculate the exact value of `min_block_time`. However, we can express it in terms of the given variables.

The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is ((input integer `a` - 1) % input integer `m`) + 1, `a_block` is ((input integer `a` - 1) // (input integer `m` * input integer `k`)) + 1, `b_floor` is ((input integer `b` - 1) % input integer `m`) + 1, `b_block` is ((input integer `b` - 1) // (input integer `m` * input integer `k`)) + 1, `min_block_time` is min(abs(`a_block` - `b_block`), `n` - abs(`a_block` - `b_block`)) * 15.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` is ((input integer `a` - 1) % input integer `m`) + 1, `a_block` is ((input integer `a` - 1) // (input integer `m` * input integer `k`)) + 1, `b_floor` is ((input integer `b` - 1) % input integer `m`) + 1, `b_block` is ((input integer `b` - 1) // (input integer `m` * input integer `k`)) + 1, `min_block_time` is min(abs(`a_block` - `b_block`), `n` - abs(`a_block` - `b_block`)) * 15**
