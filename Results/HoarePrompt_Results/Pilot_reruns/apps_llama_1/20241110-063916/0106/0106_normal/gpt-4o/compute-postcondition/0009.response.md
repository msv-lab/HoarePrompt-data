To calculate the `total_time`, we need to consider the values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

- `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1. Since `floor_a` is a positive integer, `time_to_exit` is either 0 or a multiple of 10 plus 10.
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, both of which are multiples of 15. Therefore, `min_walk_time` is also a multiple of 15.
- `time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 to 5*(k-1).

Now, let's calculate `total_time`:

`total_time` = `time_to_exit` + `min_walk_time` + `time_to_target_floor`

Since `time_to_exit` is either 0 or a multiple of 10 plus 10, `min_walk_time` is a multiple of 15, and `time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, `total_time` will be a sum of these values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n*m*k`, `a`!= `b`, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values related to the location of `a` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values related to the location of `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 to 5*(k-1), and `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.**
