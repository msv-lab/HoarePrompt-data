The function returns `total_time`. The values of `total_time`, `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` are not explicitly given, but they are calculated based on the given variables. 

`time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, which is a positive integer. 

`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and both `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are multiples of 15, ranging from 0 to 15*(n-1). 

`time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 to 5*(k-1).

Therefore, `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, which is a positive integer.

The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n*m*k`, `a`!= `b`, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values related to the location of `a` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values related to the location of `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 to 5*(k-1), `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, and the function returns `total_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n*m*k`, `a`!= `b`, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values related to the location of `a` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values related to the location of `b` in a 3D space with dimensions `n`, `m`, and `k`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is a multiple of 5, ranging from 0 to 5*(k-1), `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, and the function returns `total_time`.**
