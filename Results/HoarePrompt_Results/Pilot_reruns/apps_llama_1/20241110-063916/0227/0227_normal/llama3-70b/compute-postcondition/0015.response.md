The value of `m` is either printed as is if it's less than or equal to 23, or -1 if it's greater than 23. The value of `m` depends on the input integer `n` and the sorted list `a`. If `n` is 1 or less, `m` is 1, which is less than or equal to 23, so 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the count of elements in `a` that are not twice the previous element plus 1, and its value is either less than or equal to 23 or greater than 23, so either the count or -1 is printed.

Output State: **`m` is either 1, the count of elements in `a` that are not twice the previous element plus 1, or -1 is printed, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `n` is the input integer.**
