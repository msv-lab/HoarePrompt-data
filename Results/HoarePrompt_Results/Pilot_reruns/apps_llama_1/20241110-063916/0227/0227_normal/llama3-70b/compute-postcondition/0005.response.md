The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and `m` was initially 1, so the new value of `m` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1**
