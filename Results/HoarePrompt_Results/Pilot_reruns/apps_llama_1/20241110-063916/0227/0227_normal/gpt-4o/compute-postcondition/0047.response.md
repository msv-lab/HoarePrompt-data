Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `assigned` set is not empty and includes `a[i]`, `m` is uncertain, `x` is an element in the `assigned` set. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` set, `can_form` is set to True and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of `can_form` remains unchanged as False.***
