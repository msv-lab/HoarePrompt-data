Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `i`, and `assigned` remain unchanged. If `can_form` is `False`, `m` is increased by 1, otherwise `m` remains unchanged. `can_form` remains unchanged. In all cases, if the `assigned` set is empty, `can_form` remains `False`. If the `assigned` set is not empty, `can_form` is `True` if a pair `x` and `a[i] - x` is found in the `assigned` set, otherwise `can_form` remains `False`.***
