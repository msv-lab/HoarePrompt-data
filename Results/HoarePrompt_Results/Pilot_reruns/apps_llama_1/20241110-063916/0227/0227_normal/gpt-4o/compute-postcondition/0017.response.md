Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 23, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, where each integer is less than or equal to 10^9, `assigned` is a set containing at least three elements, the smallest integer from list `a` and two more integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to the next unprocessed integer in the `assigned` set. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `can_form` and the loop or if statement continues. In both cases, `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, and `x` retain their initial values.***
