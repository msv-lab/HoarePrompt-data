Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the sequence of operations cannot be performed with any number of variables. In such cases, the program should return -1, but the provided code does not have this functionality.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The program will return 2, but the correct answer is -1 because it is impossible to perform the sequence of operations with any number of variables.

The issue is that the program only checks if the next number in the sequence can be formed by adding two previously assigned numbers, but it does not check if the sequence of operations can be performed with the assigned numbers. To fix this, the program should keep track of the numbers that have been assigned and check if the next number in the sequence can be formed by adding two previously assigned numbers, and if not, return -1.

Here is an example of how the program can be modified to handle this case:
```python
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        if not can_form:
            if not any(a[i] - y in assigned for y in assigned):
                return -1
            m += 1
        assigned.add(a[i])
    return m
```
This modified program will return -1 if the sequence of operations cannot be performed with any number of variables.
