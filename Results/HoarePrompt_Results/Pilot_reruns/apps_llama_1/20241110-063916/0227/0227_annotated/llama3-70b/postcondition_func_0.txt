The function accepts two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` in ascending order and iterates through the sorted list to count the number of times an element is not twice the previous element. The function then prints the count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1.
