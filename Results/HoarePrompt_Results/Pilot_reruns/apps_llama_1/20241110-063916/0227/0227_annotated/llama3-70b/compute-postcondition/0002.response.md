The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. The list `a` is a list of distinct positive integers, so after sorting, the list will be in ascending order. The value of `n` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers**
