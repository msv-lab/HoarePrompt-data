The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` can be either 2 or 3, so the new value of `m` is either 3 or 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `i` is 3, and `m` is either 3 or 4.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `i` is 3, and `m` is either 3 or 4**
