According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `i` starts from 1, it should be initialized to 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, `assigned` is a set containing the smallest element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
