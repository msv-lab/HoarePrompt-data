Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, `assigned` is a set containing the smallest element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the smallest element of `a`. If the difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and `x` is in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks, otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
