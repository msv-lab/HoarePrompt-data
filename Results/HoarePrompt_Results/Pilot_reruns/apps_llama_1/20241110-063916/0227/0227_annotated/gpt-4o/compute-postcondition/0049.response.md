The code assigns `True` to the variable `can_form`. The initial state of `can_form` is `False`, so after execution, `can_form` becomes `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is `True`, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the `assigned` list, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`can_form` is `True`, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the `assigned` list, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 2**
