The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. The list `a` initially contains distinct positive integers of length `n`. After sorting, the list `a` will be in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`.**
