The function returns 'Yes'. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `remainder`, and `seen_remainders` do not change. The return statement does not change the state of these variables. The output state is: the function returns 'Yes', `i` equals `k`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `k`, and `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k`. 

Output State: **the function returns 'Yes', `i` equals `k`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `k`, and `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k`.**
