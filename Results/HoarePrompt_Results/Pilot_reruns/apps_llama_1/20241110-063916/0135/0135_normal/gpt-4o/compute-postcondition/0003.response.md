To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to run. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, k + 1)`, which means it will iterate from 1 to `k` (inclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n and 1 <= k <= 10^18.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'; otherwise, the function does not return 'No'.
- `seen_remainders` is an empty set.

For the loop to execute, we must ensure that `k` is at least 1, which is already given. However, to make the loop execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0, which is also guaranteed by the initial condition. The critical aspect here is that `i` starts at 1, and the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0.

However, the loop's execution does not depend on `n` directly in this context but rather on the value of `k`. The condition regarding `n` and the function returning 'No' is more about the overall logic of the function rather than the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` is in a state that allows the loop to run at least once. Since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `k`, we can say `i` is 1 at the start of the loop, and `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
