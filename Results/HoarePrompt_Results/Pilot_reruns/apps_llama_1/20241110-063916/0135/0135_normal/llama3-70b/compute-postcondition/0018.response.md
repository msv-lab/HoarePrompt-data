Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is either {0} or {0, 1}, and `remainder` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and terminates. Otherwise, the program continues execution without printing 'No' or terminating, maintaining the original values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `seen`, and `remainder`.***
