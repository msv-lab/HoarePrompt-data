The code adds the current value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. 

Since `remainder` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `seen` is either {0} or {0, 1}, after adding `remainder` to `seen`, the possible values of `seen` are {0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, or {0, 1, 2}. 

The other variables `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is either {0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, or {0, 1, 2}, and `remainder` is either 0, 1, or 2.**
