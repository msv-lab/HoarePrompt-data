Output State: **The loop checks if the remainders of `n` divided by all numbers from 1 to `k` are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, the loop prints 'No' and exits. After the loop executes, `i` is equal to `k`, `seen` is a set containing the unique remainders of `n` divided by all numbers from 1 to `k`, and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `k`. If `k` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set. If the loop exits early due to a duplicate remainder, `i` is the value that caused the exit, and `seen` contains the remainders seen up to that point.**
