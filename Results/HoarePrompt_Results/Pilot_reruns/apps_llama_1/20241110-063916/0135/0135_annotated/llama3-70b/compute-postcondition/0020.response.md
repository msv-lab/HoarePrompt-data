To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop iterates from `1` to `k + 1`. Since the loop has already executed with `i` being `2`, for it to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to `3`.

The loop's continuation depends solely on the value of `i` and `k`. Since `k` is at least `3`, and `i` is currently `2`, the loop can execute again if `i` becomes `3`.

The states of `n`, `remainder`, and `seen` do not affect the loop's execution condition. The program printing 'No' to the console and terminating immediately is not relevant to the loop's state.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should become `3`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1**
