Output State: **The loop checks if the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k` are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, the program prints 'No' and terminates. After the loop, if it hasn't terminated, `i` is equal to `k`, `seen` is a set containing the unique remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`. If `k` is 0 or lower, the loop doesn't execute and `seen` remains an empty set. If `k` is at least 1, the loop executes at least once.**
