It seems like there's an issue with the provided code snippet, as the function `func` does not accept any parameters, but the problem statement mentions that `n` and `k` are integers. Assuming the correct function signature is `def func(n, k):`, I'll proceed with describing the functionality.

The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The constraints on these parameters are that `n` is between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), and `k` is also between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive).

However, the output of the function is not provided. Please provide the output details, and I'll be happy to help you describe the functionality of the function.
