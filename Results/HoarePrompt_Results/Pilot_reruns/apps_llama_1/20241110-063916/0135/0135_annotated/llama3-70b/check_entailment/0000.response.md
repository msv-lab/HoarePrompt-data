Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the program should check if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, but the code does not handle the case when n is 0 correctly. 

The annotations mention that "if `n` is 0, it prints 'No' immediately", but this is not correct. When n is 0, the remainders of n divided by all integers i from 1 to k are also 0, which means they are not distinct. However, the code does not print 'No' immediately when n is 0. Instead, it will print 'Yes' because the loop will not find any duplicate remainders (since there is only one remainder, which is 0).

The annotations also mention that "if `k` is 0 or lower, it prints 'Yes' without checking any remainders", which is correct. However, this is not in line with the problem description, which states that the program should check if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct. When k is 0 or lower, there are no remainders to check, so the program should not print 'Yes' or 'No'.

The code does not handle these edge cases correctly, so it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
