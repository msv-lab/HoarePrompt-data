The code `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console, but it does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0**
