The code prints the string 'No' to the console, but it does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional effect of printing 'No' to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1, and 'No' is printed to the console**
