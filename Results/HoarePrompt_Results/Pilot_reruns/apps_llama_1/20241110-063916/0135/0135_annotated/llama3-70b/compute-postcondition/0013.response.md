Let's analyze the given code.

The code adds the current value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. 

Initially, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0. 

If `remainder` is 0, it is already in `seen`, so the program prints 'No' and terminates. 

If `remainder` is 1, it is added to `seen`, so `seen` becomes a set containing 0 and 1.

The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 2, if `remainder` was 0, the program prints 'No' and terminates, otherwise `remainder` is 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1.**
