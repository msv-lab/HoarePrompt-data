Output State: **The loop checks if the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k` are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without finding a duplicate remainder, the function continues execution with the updated values of `i`, `remainder`, and `seen_remainders`. If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. After the loop executes, `i` is equal to `k`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `k`, and `seen_remainders` is a set of unique remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`.**
