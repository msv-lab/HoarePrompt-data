Let's break down the code and annotations step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`. The annotations state that `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n, k <= 10^18`.

The first condition checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If this condition is true, the function returns 'No'. This is consistent with the annotations.

If `k` is less than `n`, the function initializes an empty set `seen_remainders`. The loop then checks the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from `1` to `k`. If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without finding a duplicate remainder, the function returns 'Yes'.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `k` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. In this case, the function returns 'Yes', but the annotations do not specify what should happen in this case.
* If `n` is `0`, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to calculate the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. The annotations do not specify what should happen in this case.

Based on the code and annotations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, returns 'No' if the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from `1` to `k` are not unique, returns 'Yes' if the remainders are unique and `k` is less than `n`, returns 'Yes' if `k` is `0`, and raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `n` is `0`. **
