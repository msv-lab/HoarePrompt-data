The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99. After executing the function body, the function returns a string representing the name of the number `n` in English. 

Case_1: If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the ones place name corresponding to the value of `n`. 
Case_2: If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns a string from the `teens` list based on `n`. 
Case_3: If `n` is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 90, the function returns the tens place name corresponding to the value of `n`. 
Case_4: If `n` is between 20 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the tens place name corresponding to the value of `n` followed by a hyphen and the ones place name corresponding to the value of `n`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` such that 0 <= n <= 99 and return the name of the number in English.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 0 <= n <= 99 and returns the name of the number in English.**
