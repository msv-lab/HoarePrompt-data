Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I have analyzed the function's functionality. Here is my summary:

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` such that 0 <= n <= 99 and returns the name of the number in English. If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the ones place name corresponding to the value of `n`. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns a string from the `teens` list based on `n`. If `n` is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 90, the function returns the tens place name corresponding to the value of `n`. If `n` is between 20 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the tens place name corresponding to the value of `n` followed by a hyphen and the ones place name corresponding to the value of `n`. However, for numbers between 10 and 19, the function does not return the correct teens place name, instead, it returns incorrect outputs like 'ten-' + `ones[n % 10]`. Additionally, if `n` is less than 0 or 100 or more, the function does not return any value. **
