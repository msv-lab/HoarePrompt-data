Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 20, the function prints a string from the `teens` list. Otherwise, the function prints a string representation of the input integer `s` in words, where the tens place is represented by a string from the `tens` list and the ones place is represented by a string from the `ones` list, with a hyphen in between if the ones place is not zero.***
