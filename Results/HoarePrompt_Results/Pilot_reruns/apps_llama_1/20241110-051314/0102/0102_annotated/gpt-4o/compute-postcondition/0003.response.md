To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99
- `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine
- `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen
- `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from ten to ninety

The code is:
```
return ones[n]
```
This code returns the string at index `n` in the `ones` list.

Given the initial state, `n` can be any integer between 0 and 99. However, since `ones` only represents numbers from zero to nine, `n` is effectively limited to 0-9 for this operation to be meaningful.

Therefore, the function returns the string representation of the number `n`, where `n` is between 0 and 9.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 99, and the function returns the string representation of `n` if `n` is between 0 and 9**
