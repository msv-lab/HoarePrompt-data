To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
print(tens[s // 10] + ('' if s % 10 == 0 else '-' + ones[s % 10]))
```

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. `s // 10` calculates the integer division of `s` by 10, which gives the tens digit of `s`. For example, if `s` is 23, `s // 10` would be 2.

2. `tens[s // 10]` accesses the string in the `tens` list at the index equal to the tens digit of `s`. Since `tens` contains the names of numbers from 20 to 90, this would give the name of the tens digit (e.g., "twenty", "thirty", etc.).

3. `s % 10` calculates the remainder of `s` divided by 10, which gives the ones digit of `s`. For example, if `s` is 23, `s % 10` would be 3.

4. The expression `'-' + ones[s % 10]` is evaluated only if `s % 10` is not equal to 0. This means that if the ones digit is not zero, it appends the name of the ones digit (e.g., "one", "two", etc.) to the tens name, separated by a hyphen.

5. The `print` function outputs the resulting string, which is the name of the number `s` in words.

Since `s` is an input integer, the output state depends on the value of `s`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the input value.

Output State: **The function prints the name of the input integer `s` in words, and the state of the variables remains unchanged: `s` is an input integer, `ones` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 0 to 9, `teens` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 10 to 19, and `tens` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 20 to 90.**
