`s` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, but it is overwritten by the new input. The values of `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` are not affected, so the output state is `s` is an input integer, `ones` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 0 to 9, `teens` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 10 to 19, and `tens` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 20 to 90.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `ones` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 0 to 9, `teens` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 10 to 19, and `tens` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 20 to 90.**
