Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer, `ones` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 0 to 9, `teens` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 10 to 19, and `tens` is a list of strings containing the names of numbers from 20 to 90. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the string at index `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is 10 or more but less than 20, the function prints the string at index `s - 10` from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or more, the function prints the name of the input integer `s` in words, combining the tens place from the `tens` list with the ones place from the `ones` list if `s` is not a multiple of 10, and only the tens place from the `tens` list if `s` is a multiple of 10.***
