Correctness: **True**

The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly converts integers from 0 to 99 into their English word equivalents.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

- The program correctly handles numbers from 0 to 9 by using the `ones` list.
- The program correctly handles numbers from 11 to 19 by using the `teens` list.
- The program correctly handles numbers from 20 to 99 by using the `tens` list and appending the corresponding word from the `ones` list if the number is not a multiple of 10.
- The program correctly handles the case where the input number is 10 by using the `tens` list.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all edge cases, including the minimum and maximum input values (0 and 99, respectively).
