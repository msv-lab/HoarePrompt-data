To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The code snippet is: `divisors.add(x // i)`

From the initial state, we know that:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9
- `A` is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i
- `divisors` is a set containing 1
- `x` is an integer such that x >= 1
- `i` is 1

Now, let's analyze the code snippet:
- The expression `x // i` performs integer division, which means it divides `x` by `i` and returns the largest possible integer.
- Since `i` is 1, the expression `x // i` is equivalent to `x`.
- The `add` method is used to add the result of the expression `x // i` to the `divisors` set.

After executing the code snippet, the `divisors` set will contain 1 and `x`.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `K`, `A`, and `i`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, `divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, `x` is an integer such that x >= 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, `divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, `x` is an integer such that x >= 1, `i` is 1**
