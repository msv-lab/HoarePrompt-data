Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, x is an integer such that x >= 9, i is 3, and divisors is a set that contains 1, 2, 3, x, x // 2, and x // 3 if x is divisible by 3, otherwise divisors remains unchanged containing 1, 2, 3, x, and x // 2. In either case, the set divisors includes all the divisors that have been added so far.***
