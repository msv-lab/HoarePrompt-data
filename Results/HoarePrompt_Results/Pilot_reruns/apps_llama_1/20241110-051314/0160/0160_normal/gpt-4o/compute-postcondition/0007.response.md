To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is: `divisors.add(x // i)`

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2
- `x` is an integer such that `x >= 1`
- `divisors` is a set that contains 1, 2, and/or `x`, and 2 is added to the set `divisors`

Now, let's calculate the result:
- The expression `x // i` performs integer division of `x` by `i`. Since `i` is 2, this expression calculates the integer part of `x` divided by 2.
- The result of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`.

Since `x` can be any integer greater than or equal to 1, the value of `x // i` can be any integer greater than or equal to 0 (when `x` is 1, `x // i` is 0, and when `x` is 2 or more, `x // i` is 1 or more).

However, we cannot determine the exact value of `x // i` without knowing the exact value of `x`. Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9
- `A` is a list of integers such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^6 for all `i`
- `x` is an integer such that `x >= 1`
- `i` is 2
- `divisors` is a set that contains 1, 2, `x`, and/or `x // 2` (the result of the integer division of `x` by 2)

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^6 for all `i`, `x` is an integer such that `x >= 1`, `i` is 2, and `divisors` is a set that contains 1, 2, `x`, and/or `x // 2`**
