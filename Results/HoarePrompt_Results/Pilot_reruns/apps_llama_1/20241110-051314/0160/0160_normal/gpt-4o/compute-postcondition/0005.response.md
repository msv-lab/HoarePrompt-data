To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The value of `x` is still the same, so `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` remains the same.

Since `i` is now 2, we need to re-evaluate the condition `x is divisible by i`. If `x` is divisible by 2, the `divisors` set will be updated. However, we cannot determine the exact contents of the `divisors` set without knowing the value of `x`. Therefore, we can only update the state of `i` and leave the other variables unchanged.

State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, x is an integer such that x >= 1, i is 2, divisors is a set that may contain 1, 2, and/or x**
