`gcd` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor of `gcd` and `A[i]`. The value of `i` is 3, so `A[i]` is the fourth integer in the list `A`. The initial value of `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the first three integers in the list `A`. Therefore, the new value of `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the first four integers in the list `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an input integer greater than 2, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a new list of integers, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the first four integers in the list `A`, `i` is 3**
