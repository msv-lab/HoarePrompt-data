Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `gcd` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `A` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `K` is an input integer. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`, where the previous value is at least 2 or the greatest common divisor of the first `N` integers in `A`, whichever is greater. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
