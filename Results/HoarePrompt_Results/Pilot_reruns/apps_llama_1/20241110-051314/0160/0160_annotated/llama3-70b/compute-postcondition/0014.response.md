To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The code is: `max_divisor = max(max_divisor, gcd // i)`

From the initial state, we know:
- `max_divisor` is at least 1
- `i` is 1
- `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements
- `K` is an input integer
- `N` is at least 1

However, the code snippet provided does not explicitly define or modify `A`, `K`, or `N`. It also does not define `gcd`, but for the purpose of this analysis, we will assume `gcd` is a defined variable holding a value that represents the greatest common divisor of some numbers, since its exact definition is not provided.

Given `i` is 1, the expression `gcd // i` simplifies to just `gcd`. Therefore, the code essentially becomes `max_divisor = max(max_divisor, gcd)`.

Since `max_divisor` is at least 1 and `gcd` is not explicitly defined but presumably is a positive integer (as gcd values typically are), `max_divisor` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `gcd`. 

Thus, the output state regarding the explicitly mentioned variables in the code snippet is that `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd`, and the values of `i`, `A`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is the maximum of its previous value and `gcd`, `i` is 1, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements, `K` is an input integer, and `N` is at least 1**
