The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` accepts a new input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `A`. The values of `N` and `K` are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a list of input integers**
