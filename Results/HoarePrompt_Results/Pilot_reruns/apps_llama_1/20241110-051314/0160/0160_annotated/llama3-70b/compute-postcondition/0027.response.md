To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

`for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1):`

The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 4.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* `i` needs to be incremented to 4, since it is currently 3.
* `gcd` needs to be at least 16 (4^2), since the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. If `gcd` is less than 16, the loop will terminate.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`max_divisor` is at least 1, `i` is 4, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements, `K` is an input integer, `N` is at least 1, and `gcd` is at least 16**
