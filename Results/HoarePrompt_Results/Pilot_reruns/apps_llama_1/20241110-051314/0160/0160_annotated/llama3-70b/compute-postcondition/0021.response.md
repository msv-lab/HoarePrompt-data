Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements, `K` is an input integer, `N` is at least 1, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 4. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`, and if `i` squared is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `gcd` by `i`. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, the state of `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
