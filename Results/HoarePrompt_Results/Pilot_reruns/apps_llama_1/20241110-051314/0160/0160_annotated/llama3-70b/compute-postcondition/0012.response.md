To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we'll analyze the loop condition and the variables involved.

The loop condition is `range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1)`, which means the loop will execute if `gcd` is at least 1.

From the state before the loop starts, we know:

* `max_divisor` is either the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A` (if `N` is at least 2) or the first element of `A` (if `N` is 1 or less and `A` is non-empty) or is undefined (if `N` is 1 or less and `A` is empty)
* `i` is `N-1`
* `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements
* `K` is an input integer

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states as follows:

* `gcd` must be at least 1, which means `max_divisor` must be at least 1. This is possible if `N` is at least 2, or if `N` is 1 and `A` is non-empty.
* `i` is not used in the loop condition, but it's initialized to `N-1`. To make it consistent with the loop condition, we can set `i` to 1, which is the starting value of the loop.
* `A` and `K` are not directly related to the loop condition, so their states remain the same.

State: **`max_divisor` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements, `K` is an input integer, and `N` is at least 1**
