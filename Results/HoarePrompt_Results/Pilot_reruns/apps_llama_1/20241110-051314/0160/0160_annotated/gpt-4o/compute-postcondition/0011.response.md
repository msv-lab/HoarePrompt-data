To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is: `divisors.add(x // i)`

From the initial state, we know that `i` is 3 and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4.

We need to calculate the value of `x // i`, which is equivalent to `x // 3`. Since `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `x // 3` will be at least 1.

Now, let's analyze the possible values of `x // 3`:

* If `x` is divisible by 3, then `x // 3` will be an integer, and `divisors` will already contain this value. In this case, adding `x // 3` to `divisors` will not change the set.
* If `x` is not divisible by 3, then `x // 3` will be the integer part of the division, and `divisors` will not contain this value. In this case, adding `x // 3` to `divisors` will add a new value to the set.

Since `divisors` initially contains the values 1, 3, `x`, and `x // 3` if `x` is divisible by 3, the updated `divisors` set will contain the values 1, 3, `x`, and `x // 3` in both cases.

The other variables (`N`, `K`, `A`, `x`, and `i`) are not affected by the code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, and `divisors` is a set containing the values 1, 3, `x`, and `x // 3**.
