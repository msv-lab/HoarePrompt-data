The function `func_2` does not match the parameters described, so I will assume the function is actually defined as `def func_2(N, K, A):`.

The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, and `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). After executing the function body, the function returns the sorted `divisors` set in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, K, and A, and returns the sorted divisors set in descending order.**
