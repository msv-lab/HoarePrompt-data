The code adds a new divisor to the set `divisors`. The new divisor is calculated as `x // i`, where `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 1.

Since `i` is 1, the new divisor is simply `x`. Therefore, the set `divisors` now contains the values 1 and `x`.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` is a set containing the values 1 and `x`, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
