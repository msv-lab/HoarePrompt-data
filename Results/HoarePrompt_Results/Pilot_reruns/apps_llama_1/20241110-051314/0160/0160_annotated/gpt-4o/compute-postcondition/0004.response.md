Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). If `x` is divisible by `i`, `divisors` is a set containing the values 1 and `x`, otherwise `divisors` remains an empty set, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1.***
