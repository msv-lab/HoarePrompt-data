To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

Currently, `i` is 2, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4. To ensure the loop executes again, `i` should be incremented to 3, and the square root of `x` should still be greater than or equal to 3.

No changes are needed for `N`, `K`, `A`, as they are not related to the loop condition. The state of `divisors` depends on the value of `i` and `x`, but since we are only incrementing `i`, the state of `divisors` will be updated accordingly in the next iteration.

State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, K is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, A is a list of N integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, i is 3, and divisors is a set containing the values 1 and x if x is not divisible by i, otherwise divisors is a set containing the values 1, 3, x, and x // i.**
