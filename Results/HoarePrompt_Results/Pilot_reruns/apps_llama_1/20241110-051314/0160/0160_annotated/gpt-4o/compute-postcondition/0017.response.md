Let's analyze the code and annotations step by step:

1. The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `x`.
2. The annotations mention that `N`, `K`, and `A` are parameters, but they are not used in the function. It seems that the annotations are incorrect, and these parameters are not actually part of the function.
3. The function calculates the divisors of `x` and stores them in the `divisors` set.
4. The loop iterates from 1 to the square root of `x`, and for each divisor `i`, it adds both `i` and `x // i` to the `divisors` set.
5. After the loop, the function returns the sorted `divisors` set in descending order.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the `divisors` set remains empty. This is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.
* If `x` is a perfect square, it will be added to the set only once. This is mentioned in the annotations.
* If `x` is 1, the loop executes once, and the `divisors` set contains only 1. This is mentioned in the annotations.

Based on the code and annotations, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and returns the sorted set of its divisors in descending order. If `x` is less than 1, the function returns an empty set. If `x` is a perfect square, it is added to the set only once. If `x` is 1, the function returns a set containing only 1. **
