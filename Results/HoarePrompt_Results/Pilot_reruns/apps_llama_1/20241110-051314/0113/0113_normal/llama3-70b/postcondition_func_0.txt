The function takes two input integers `n` and `k` from the user, calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and prints the smallest multiple of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`, assuming `n` and `k` are valid integers and `k` is non-negative. If `n` is already a multiple of `x`, the function prints the original value of `n`. However, the function does not validate the input values, and its behavior is undefined for invalid inputs.
