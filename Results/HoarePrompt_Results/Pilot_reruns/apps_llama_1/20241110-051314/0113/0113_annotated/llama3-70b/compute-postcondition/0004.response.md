Let's think step by step:

The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. 

Initially, `n` is an input integer plus 1. So, after incrementing by 1, `n` becomes an input integer plus 2.

The values of `k` and `x` are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer plus 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer plus 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.**
