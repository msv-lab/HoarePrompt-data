Based on the annotated code, I can see that the function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it takes two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. 

The function calculates the index of the first occurrence of 1 and `n` in the list `a`, and then calculates four distances: `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. These distances seem to represent the distance from the first and last positions in the list to the positions of 1 and `n`.

The function then calculates the maximum of these four distances and prints it.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The function does not check if the input list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. If the list contains duplicates or integers outside this range, the function may produce incorrect results.
* The function does not check if the input integer `n` is between 2 and 100. If `n` is outside this range, the function may produce incorrect results.
* The function does not handle the case where the input list `a` is empty or contains only one element. In this case, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception.
* The function does not handle the case where the input integer `n` is 1. In this case, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception.

Taking these potential edge cases and missing logic into account, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function takes two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It calculates the index of the first occurrence of 1 and `n` in the list `a`, and then calculates four distances. The function prints the maximum of these four distances, but may produce incorrect results if the input list `a` contains duplicates or integers outside the range 1 to `n`, or if the input integer `n` is outside the range 2 to 100, or if the input list `a` is empty or contains only one element, or if the input integer `n` is 1. **
