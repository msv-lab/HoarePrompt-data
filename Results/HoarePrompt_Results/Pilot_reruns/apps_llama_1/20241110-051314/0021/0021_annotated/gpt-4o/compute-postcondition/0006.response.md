To calculate the output state, we need to understand the given initial state and the impact of the code on the program.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`
- `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`

The code is:
```python
dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)
```

The impact of the code on the program is that it calculates the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, which is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`. This difference is assigned to `dist3`.

Since `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `dist3` will be equal to `min_pos` because `min_pos` is always non-negative (it's an index).

The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, and `dist2`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`
- `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`
- `dist3` is `min_pos`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, and `dist3` is `min_pos`**
