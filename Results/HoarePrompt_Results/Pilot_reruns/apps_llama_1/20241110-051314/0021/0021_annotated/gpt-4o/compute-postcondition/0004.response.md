`dist1` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`. The value of `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, which is a list of input integers. The values of `n`, `a`, and `min_pos` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
