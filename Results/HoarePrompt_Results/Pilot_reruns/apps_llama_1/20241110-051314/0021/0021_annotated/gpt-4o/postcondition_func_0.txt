The function takes two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It calculates the index of the first occurrence of 1 and `n` in the list `a`, and then calculates four distances. The function prints the maximum of these four distances, but may produce incorrect results if the input list `a` contains duplicates or integers outside the range 1 to `n`, or if the input integer `n` is outside the range 2 to 100, or if the input list `a` is empty or contains only one element, or if the input integer `n` is 1.
