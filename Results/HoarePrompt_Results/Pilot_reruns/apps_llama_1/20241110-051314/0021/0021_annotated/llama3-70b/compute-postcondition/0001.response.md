The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reassigns the value of `a` by taking a new input, splitting it into integers, and storing them in a list.

The initial state of `a` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to the original value of `n`, but this state is overwritten by the new input.

The new value of `a` is a list of integers from the new input, and the original value of `n` is not used in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input**
