Correctness: **True**

I have carefully analyzed the code and the problem description, and I believe that the code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. The code takes the size of the permutation `n` and the permutation `a` as input, and it correctly calculates the indices of the minimum and maximum elements (1 and `n` respectively) in the permutation. It then calculates the maximum possible distance between these elements by considering the two possible swaps that can be made to maximize the distance.

The annotations provided with the code are helpful in understanding the code's logic and the variables' values at each step. However, I did not rely solely on the annotations to make my judgment. Instead, I carefully analyzed the code and the problem description to ensure that the code correctly implements the problem description.

In particular, I checked that the code correctly handles the cases where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the maximum possible distance, and where the swap operation is not necessary. I also checked that the code correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements.

The problem description provides three examples, and I verified that the code produces the correct output for each of these examples. I did not find any other cases where the code does not work correctly.

Overall, I believe that the code is correct and implements the problem description for every potential case.
