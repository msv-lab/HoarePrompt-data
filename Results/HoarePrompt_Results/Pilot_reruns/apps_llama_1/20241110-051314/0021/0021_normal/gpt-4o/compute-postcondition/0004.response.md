`dist1` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`. Since `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, the value of `dist1` will be equal to the absolute value of `max_pos`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`.**
