To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code snippet is:
```
dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)
```
This line of code calculates the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, and assigns the result to `dist3`.

Since `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, its value can be any non-negative integer.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, and `dist2`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is either `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`, and `dist3` is the absolute value of `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of `max_pos`, `dist2` is either `abs(n - 1 - dist1)` or `abs(n - 1 + dist1)`, and `dist3` is the absolute value of `min_pos`**
