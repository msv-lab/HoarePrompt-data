The function takes an integer input `n` and a list of integers `a` as input from the user, calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n` in the list, and prints the result. However, it does not handle cases where the input list is empty or does not contain 1 or `n`, and it does not handle cases where the input integer `n` is less than 2.
