The function func accepts no parameters but uses two variables n and a. n is an input integer, and a is a list of input integers. 

The function calculates the indices of the first occurrence of 1 and n in the list a, denoted as pos1 and posn, respectively. 

Then, it calculates the maximum and minimum distances between pos1 and posn, considering the boundaries of the list (i.e., 0 and n-1). 

However, the function does not handle the case when 1 or n is not present in the list a, which would result in a ValueError when calling the index method. 

Additionally, the function does not validate the input for n and a according to the constraints mentioned in the problem statement (2 <= n <= 100 and a being a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n). 

The function prints the maximum of max_dist and n-1-min_dist, which seems to be the maximum possible distance between 1 and n in the list a, considering the boundaries.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters but uses two variables n and a, calculates the indices of the first occurrence of 1 and n in the list a, and prints the maximum possible distance between 1 and n in the list a, considering the boundaries, without handling the cases when 1 or n is not present in the list a and without validating the input for n and a. **
