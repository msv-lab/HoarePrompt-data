Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. It calculates the indices of the first occurrence of 1 and n in the list a, and then prints the maximum possible distance between 1 and n in the list a, considering the boundaries.

However, after re-examining the code and the output hints, I noticed that the code does not handle the case when 1 or n is not present in the list a. The output hints mention that the function does not handle this case, and this is a valid concern.

Furthermore, the code assumes that the input list a contains distinct integers from 1 to n, but it does not validate this assumption. If the input list a contains duplicate integers or integers outside the range [1, n], the code may produce incorrect results.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case when n is less than 2, which is a valid input according to the problem description.

Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, I conclude that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the cases when 1 or n is not present in the list a, the input list a contains duplicate integers or integers outside the range [1, n], and n is less than 2.
