`max_dist` is assigned the value of the maximum between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The value of `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, and the value of `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`. The absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn` is the distance between the first occurrences of 1 and `n` in `a`, and subtracting 1 gives the distance between the first occurrence of 1 and the last occurrence of `n` in the range between them, or vice versa. The value of `n - 2` is the maximum possible distance between the first and last elements in the range from the first occurrence of 1 to the last occurrence of `n` in `a`. The maximum of these two values is assigned to `max_dist`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.**
