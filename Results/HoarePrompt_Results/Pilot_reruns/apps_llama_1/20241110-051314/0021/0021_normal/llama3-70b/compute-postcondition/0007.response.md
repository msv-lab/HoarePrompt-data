It seems like there is a mistake in the problem statement. The function definition is `def func():`, which means it doesn't accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `n` and `a`, which are not defined in the function.

Assuming the correct function definition is `def func(n, a):`, here's the answer:

The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. 

However, the output is not provided. Please provide the output to complete the functionality description.

Once the output is provided, I can complete the functionality description in the required format.
