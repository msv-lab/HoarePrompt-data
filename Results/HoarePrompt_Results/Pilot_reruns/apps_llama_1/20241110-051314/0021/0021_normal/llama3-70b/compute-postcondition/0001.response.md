The given code line `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reassigns the value of `a` by taking a new input, splitting it into integers, and storing them in a list.

The initial state of `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, but this state is overwritten by the new input.

The new value of `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, but the number of elements and their values are unknown.

The value of `n` is not affected by this code line.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers**
