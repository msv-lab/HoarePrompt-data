Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements in the array by performing exactly one swap. 

Here's why the program works:

- It first finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array.
- Then, it calculates the maximum possible distance between these two elements by considering two cases:
  - If the minimum and maximum elements are already at a distance of `n-2` or more, the maximum possible distance is `n-1` minus the minimum distance between the two elements that are closest to the ends of the array. This is because swapping these two elements will result in the maximum possible distance.
  - If the minimum and maximum elements are at a distance of less than `n-2`, the maximum possible distance is `n-2` minus the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. This is because swapping the minimum element with the element at the end of the array (or the maximum element with the element at the beginning of the array) will result in the maximum possible distance.
- The program then prints the maximum of these two possible distances, which is the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements that can be achieved by performing exactly one swap.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the cases where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the array, or where the distance between them is already maximum. Therefore, the program is correct.
