The function func_1 accepts three parameters: a positive integer n, a positive integer t, and a list of n tuples bus_routes, where each tuple contains two positive integers.

According to the code, the function calculates the minimum wait time for the next bus across all routes and stores it in min_wait_time, and the corresponding route index in chosen_route. However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic that need to be considered.

If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and min_wait_time remains positive infinity and chosen_route remains -1. In this case, the function returns -1.

If n is greater than 0, the loop executes n times, and min_wait_time is the minimum wait time across all routes, and chosen_route is the index of the route with the minimum wait time.

However, the code does not handle the case where all wait times are equal. In this case, the function will return the index of the last route with the minimum wait time.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input list bus_routes is empty or contains tuples with non-positive integers. In these cases, the function may raise an exception or produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate the minimum wait time for the next bus across all routes and return the index of the route with the minimum wait time if n is greater than 0, otherwise return -1. However, the function may not work correctly for all possible inputs, especially when n is 0, or the input list bus_routes is empty or contains invalid data.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer n, a positive integer t, and a list of n tuples bus_routes, and returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time if n is greater than 0, otherwise returns -1. However, the function may not work correctly for all possible inputs, especially when n is 0, or the input list bus_routes is empty or contains invalid data. **
