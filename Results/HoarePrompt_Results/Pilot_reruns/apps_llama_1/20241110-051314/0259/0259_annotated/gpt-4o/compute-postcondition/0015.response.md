The code `wait_time = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `wait_time`. This does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is 0**
