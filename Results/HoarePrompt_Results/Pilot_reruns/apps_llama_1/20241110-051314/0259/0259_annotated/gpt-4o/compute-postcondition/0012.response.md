According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is used to index the `bus_routes` list, the values of `s_i` and `d_i` also need to be updated to the corresponding elements of the next tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`**
