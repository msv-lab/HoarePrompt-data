`wait_time` is assigned the value `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The value of `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, and `t` is a positive integer. The expression `(t - s_i) % d_i` calculates the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`. 

Since the values of `d_i`, `s_i`, and `t` are not specified, we cannot calculate the exact value of `wait_time`. However, we can express `wait_time` in terms of `d_i`, `s_i`, and `t`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i**
