To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples.
- `i` is 2.
- `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`.
- `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`.
- `wait_time` is calculated based on the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`.

The code snippet is:
```python
min_wait_time = wait_time
```
This line assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be the same as the initial state with the addition of `min_wait_time` being equal to `wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is calculated based on the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, and its exact value depends on these variables, we can conclude that `min_wait_time` will have the same value as `wait_time` based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is the minimum time to wait for the next bus based on `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
