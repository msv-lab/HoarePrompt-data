The value of `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` depends on the values of `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. 

If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. 
If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. 
Otherwise, `wait_time` is the difference between `d_i` and the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`.

Since the initial value of `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, it will be updated to a non-infinity value. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple in `bus_routes`.**
