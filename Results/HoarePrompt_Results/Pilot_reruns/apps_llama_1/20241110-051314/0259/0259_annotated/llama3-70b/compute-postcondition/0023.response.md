The code `ans = i + 1` assigns a new value to the variable `ans`. The initial state of `ans` is -1, but this value is overwritten. The initial state of `i` is 1.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1`, so `ans` becomes 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`buses` is a list of `n` tuples with `n` greater than 0, `s` is `buses[1][0]`, `d` is `buses[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `min_time` is `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is 2, and `time` is `(t - s) % d`**
