Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `buses.append((s, d))` appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the end of the `buses` list. 

The initial state of `buses` is a list containing two tuples with input integers. After appending the new tuple, the `buses` list will contain three tuples.

The values of `n`, `t`, `s`, and `d` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing three tuples with input integers, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing three tuples with input integers, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
