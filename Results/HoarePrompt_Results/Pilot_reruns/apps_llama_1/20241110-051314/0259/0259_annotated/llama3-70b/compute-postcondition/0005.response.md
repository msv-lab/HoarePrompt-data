According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. However, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, because the loop has already executed once.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing one tuple with input integers `s` and `d`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
