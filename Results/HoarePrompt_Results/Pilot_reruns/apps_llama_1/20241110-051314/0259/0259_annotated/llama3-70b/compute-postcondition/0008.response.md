According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than the current iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. This means that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing two tuples with input integers, `s` is a new input integer, `d` is a new input integer**

Note that I did not adjust `n` to be exactly 2, but rather kept it as "greater than 1", since the original state only provided a lower bound for `n`, and we don't have any information about an upper bound.
