Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when multiple buses arrive at the same time. According to the problem description, if several buses come at the same time, Serval will choose one randomly. However, the program always chooses the first bus route that arrives at the same time as the minimum time.

For example, if the input is:

3 7
2 2
2 3
2 4

The program will output 1, but according to the problem description, 2 is also an acceptable answer. The program should be able to output either 1 or 2 in this case.

To fix this issue, the program should keep track of all bus routes that arrive at the same time as the minimum time, and then randomly choose one of them as the answer.
