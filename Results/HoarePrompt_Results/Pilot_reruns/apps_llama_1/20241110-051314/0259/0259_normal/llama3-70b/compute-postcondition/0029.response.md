Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, and `time` is `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 3. Otherwise, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
