The code `buses.append((s, d))` appends a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the `buses` list. 

Initially, `buses` is an empty list, so after execution, it will contain one tuple with the values of `s` and `d`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing a tuple with an input integer and another input integer, `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
