The function reads input from the user, including the number of bus routes `n` and the target time `t`, and then reads `n` bus routes. It calculates the waiting time for each bus route and returns the index of the bus route with the minimum waiting time, or -1 if no bus routes are read or if an error occurs. If multiple bus routes have the same minimum waiting time, the function returns the index of the first one. The function does not handle invalid input, such as non-integer or undefined values for `n` or `t`.
