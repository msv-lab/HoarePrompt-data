`s` and `d` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, split by a space. The values of `n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
