Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of at least 1 tuple, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, `_` is `n-1`. If `(t - s) % d` is less than the current `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to `(t - s) % d` and `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 0.***
