Let's analyze the code.

The code is a simple assignment statement: `ans = -1`. This statement assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ans`.

The initial state mentions several variables, but none of them are affected by this assignment statement. The variable `ans` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can assume it is a new variable being introduced.

Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list of `n` tuples, `s` and `d` are the last input integers read by the loop, `_` is `n-1`, `min_time` is positive infinity, and `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list of `n` tuples, `s` and `d` are the last input integers read by the loop, `_` is `n-1`, `min_time` is positive infinity, and `ans` is -1**
