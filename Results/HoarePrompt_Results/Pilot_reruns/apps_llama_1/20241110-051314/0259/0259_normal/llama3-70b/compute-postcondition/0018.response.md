To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given Python code and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `buses` is a list of at least 1 tuple
- `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`
- `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`
- `_` is `n-1`
- `min_time` is `(t - s) % d`
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 0
- `time` is `(t - s) % d`

Now, let's analyze the given Python code:
```
ans = i + 1
```
This line of code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans`. 

From the initial state, we know that `i` is 0. Therefore, `i + 1` equals 1.

The output state is:
- `buses` is a list of at least 1 tuple
- `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`
- `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`
- `_` is `n-1`
- `min_time` is `(t - s) % d`
- `ans` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `time` is `(t - s) % d`

Output State: **`buses` is a list of at least 1 tuple, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, `_` is `n-1`, `min_time` is `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, `time` is `(t - s) % d`**
