According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the loop counter `_`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing a tuple with an input integer and another input integer, `_` is 1, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
