Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`. If `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`, subtracted from `d_i`.***
