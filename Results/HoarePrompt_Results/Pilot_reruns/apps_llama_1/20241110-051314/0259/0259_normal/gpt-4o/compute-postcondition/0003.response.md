`s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`. Since `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the first pair in `bus_routes`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`**
