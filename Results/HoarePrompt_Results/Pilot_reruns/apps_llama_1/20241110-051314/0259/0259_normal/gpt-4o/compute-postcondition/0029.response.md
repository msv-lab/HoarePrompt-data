`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` depends on the values of `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`. Therefore, the value of `min_wait_time` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes**
