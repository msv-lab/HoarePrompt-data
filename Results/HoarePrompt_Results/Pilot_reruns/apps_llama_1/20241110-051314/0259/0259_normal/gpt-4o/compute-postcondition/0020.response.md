Let's analyze the code.

The code `chosen_route = i + 1` assigns a new value to the variable `chosen_route`. 

The initial value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2.

The initial value of `chosen_route` is 1, which is now updated to 2.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is either `s_i - t`, 0, or an integer between 1 and `d_i` (inclusive), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is either `s_i - t`, 0, or an integer between 1 and `d_i` (inclusive), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second pair in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the second pair in `bus_routes**
