Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i` minus `t`. If `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `d_i`, calculated as `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`.***
