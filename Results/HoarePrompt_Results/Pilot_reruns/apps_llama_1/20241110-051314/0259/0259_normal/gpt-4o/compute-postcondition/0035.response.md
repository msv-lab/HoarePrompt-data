The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, and `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers `(s_i, d_i)`. After executing the function body, the function returns the route with the minimum waiting time among all bus routes. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of `n` pairs of positive integers `bus_routes`, and return the bus route with the minimum waiting time.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a positive integer t, and a list of n pairs of positive integers bus_routes, and returns the bus route with the minimum waiting time.**
