To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is: `for i in range(1, k):`

This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10, and `i` is not explicitly mentioned but we can infer that `i` must be at least 1 since it started from 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10, we can adjust the state of `i` to be at least 1 and less than `k`. 

However, we also need to consider the upper bound of `k`. Since `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 10, for `i` to be less than `k`, `k` must be at least 3 (because `i` is at least 1 and `i` must be less than `k`). 

Therefore, the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to be at least 3.

The state of `n` and `dp[n, k]` does not affect the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 3 <= k <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is 9 + 9 * (10**n), `i` is 1**
