You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    #State of the program here: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is an empty dictionary
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #State of the program after the return statement: `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts integers `l`, `r`, and `k` within specific ranges, and returns the result of the expression `(count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD`, assuming the `count` function is defined elsewhere. However, the function may return 0 if `l` is equal to `r`, raise a `KeyError` if `k` is equal to 0, or raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if `MOD` is 0.

#Function 2:
def count(n, k, dp):
    if (k == 0) :
        return 0
        #State of the program after the return statement: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary, and the function returns 0
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary, and the function returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer, and dp is a dictionary. If k is 0, the function returns 0; otherwise, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
    if ((n, k) in dp) :
        return dp[n, k]
        #State of the program after the return statement: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary. If (n, k) is a key in dp, the function returns the corresponding value dp[n, k]. Otherwise, the function's behavior is undefined, covering the cases where k is 0, k is a positive integer between 1 and 10, and any other cases not explicitly handled.
    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n
        #State of the program here: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary where `dp[n, k]` is `n`.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary where `dp[n, k]` is `n`.
    else :
        dp[n, k] = 9
        #State of the program here: n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary where dp[n, k] is 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `k` is 0 or 1, `dp[n, k]` is 9. If `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is the sum of 9 plus the accumulated sum from the loop, which effectively calculates a value representing a number with `k` digits all being 9, adjusted for the powers of 10 up to `k-1`. `n` remains a non-negative integer, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10.
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        #State of the program here: `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value based on `n` and `k`, and `n` remains a non-negative integer, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
        #State of the program here: `n` remains a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and `dp[n, k]` is a non-negative integer less than `MOD`.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: `n` remains a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and `dp[n, k]` is a non-negative integer less than `MOD`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary. If (n, k) is a key in dp, the function returns the corresponding value dp[n, k]. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is set to n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is set to a calculated value based on n and k, which is a non-negative integer less than MOD, covering the cases where k is 0, k is a positive integer between 1 and 10, and any other cases not explicitly handled.
    return dp[n, k]
    #State of the program after the return statement: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that `0 <= k <= 10`, `dp` is a dictionary, and the function returns the value of `dp[n, k]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, an integer `k` between 0 and 10, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, the corresponding value from `dp` if `(n, k)` is a key in `dp`, or a calculated value based on `n` and `k` if `n` is less than or greater than or equal to `10` to the power of `k`. However, the function's behavior is undefined for negative `k`, `k` greater than 10, non-dictionary `dp`, and `n` exactly equal to `10` to the power of `k`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
