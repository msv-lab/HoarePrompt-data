Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary. If (n, k) is a key in dp, the function returns the corresponding value dp[n, k]. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is set to n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is set to a calculated value based on n and k, which is a non-negative integer less than MOD, covering the cases where k is 0, k is a positive integer between 1 and 10, and any other cases not explicitly handled.***
