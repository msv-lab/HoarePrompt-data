The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, an integer `k` between 0 and 10, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0, the corresponding value from `dp` if `(n, k)` is a key in `dp`, or a calculated value based on `n` and `k` if `n` is less than or greater than or equal to `10` to the power of `k`. However, the function's behavior is undefined for negative `k`, `k` greater than 10, non-dictionary `dp`, and `n` exactly equal to `10` to the power of `k`.
