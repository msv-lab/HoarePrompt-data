To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

`for i in range(1, k):`

The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is an integer such that 3 <= k <= 10. Since `i` starts from 1, we need to adjust the value of `i` to ensure that it is still less than `k`.

Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can assume that `i` is the loop variable and its value is not directly observable. However, we can infer that `i` is at least 1, since it starts from 1.

To ensure that the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the value of `k` to be greater than the current value of `i`. Since `k` is an integer such that 3 <= k <= 10, we can adjust it to be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 4 <= k <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is 10**
