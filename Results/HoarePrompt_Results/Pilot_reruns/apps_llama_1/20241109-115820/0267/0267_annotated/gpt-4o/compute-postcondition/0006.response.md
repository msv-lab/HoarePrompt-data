Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`. If `func_1(l, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is either `(l % MOD + l + 1) % MOD` or `(l + 1) % MOD` depending on the previous value of `total_sum` and `l` is the previous value of `num`. If `func_1(l, k)` returns False, then `total_sum` remains 0 and `l` is the previous value of `num`.***
