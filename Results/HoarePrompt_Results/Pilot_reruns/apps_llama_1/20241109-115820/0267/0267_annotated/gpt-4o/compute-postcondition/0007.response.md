To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `num in range(l, r + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is `l + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to `l + 2`.

Additionally, since `num` is the loop variable, we need to adjust the state of `l` to `l + 1`, as it will be the previous value of `num` in the next iteration.

The state of `r` and `k` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop iteration.

The state of `total_sum` is dependent on the result of `func_1(l, k)`, but since we don't know the result of this function call, we cannot determine the exact value of `total_sum`. However, we can say that `total_sum` will be either `(l % MOD + l + 2) % MOD` or `(l + 2) % MOD` if `func_1(l + 1, k)` returns True, or remains 0 if `func_1(l + 1, k)` returns False.

State: **`l` is the previous value of `num` plus 1, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is `l + 2`, `total_sum` is either `(l % MOD + l + 2) % MOD`, `(l + 2) % MOD`, or 0**
