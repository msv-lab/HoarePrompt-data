The function returns `dp[n, k]`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, and `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= 10`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= 10`, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= 10`, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.**
