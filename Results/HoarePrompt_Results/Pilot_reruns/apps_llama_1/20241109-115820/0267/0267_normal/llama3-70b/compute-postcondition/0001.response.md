Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer such that k <= 10. If k is 0, the function returns 0; otherwise, the function's behavior is unspecified because there is no else part to handle this case, but the precondition still holds that k is a positive integer, implying k will never actually be 0, thus this condition will never be met, and the function will not return 0.***

However, based on the given precondition that k is a positive integer, the condition k == 0 will never be true. Therefore, the postcondition can be simplified to:

Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer such that k <= 10, and the function's behavior is unspecified because there is no else part to handle the case when k is not 0.***

But if we consider the case when k is not 0, then the postcondition can be written as:

Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer such that k <= 10. Since k can never be 0 according to the precondition, the function does not return 0, and its behavior for all other values of k is unspecified.***
