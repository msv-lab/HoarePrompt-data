The function returns 0. The values of `n` and `k` are not changed, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, and the function returns 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, and the function returns 0**
