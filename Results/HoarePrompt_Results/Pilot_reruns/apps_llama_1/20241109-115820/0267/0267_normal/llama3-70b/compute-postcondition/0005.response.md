The value of `dp[n, k]` is assigned to 9. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` was the corresponding value for the pair (n, k), but now it is changed to 9. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected, so they remain the same. The function does not return any value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, and `dp[n, k]` is 9**
