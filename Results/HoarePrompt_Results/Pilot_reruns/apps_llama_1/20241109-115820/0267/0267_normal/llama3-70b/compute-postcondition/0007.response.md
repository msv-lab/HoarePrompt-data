To calculate the output state, we'll analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10.
- `dp[n, k]` is 9.
- `i` is 1.

The code to execute is:
```python
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
```

Now, let's calculate the new value of `dp[n, k]`:

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`: Since `i` is 1, `10 ** (i - 1)` equals `10 ** 0`, which is 1.
2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`: Since `i` is 1, this simplifies to `10 ** (k - 1)`. Given `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, this will be a value between `10 ** 0` (1) and `10 ** 9`.
3. Calculate `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)`: This simplifies to `10 ** (k - 1) - 1`, given `i` is 1.
4. Multiply by `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)`: This is `9 * 1` since `10 ** (i - 1)` is 1, resulting in 9.
5. The entire expression becomes `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.

Now, add this result to `dp[n, k]` which is initially 9:
```python
dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
```

Given `k` is between 2 and 10, let's consider the possible outcomes for `dp[n, k]`:
- For `k = 2`, `10 ** (k - 1) - 1` equals 9, so `dp[n, k]` becomes `9 + 9 * 9 = 90`.
- For `k = 3`, `10 ** (k - 1) - 1` equals 99, so `dp[n, k]` becomes `9 + 9 * 99 = 900`.
- This pattern continues up to `k = 10`, where `10 ** (k - 1) - 1` equals 999999999, so `dp[n, k]` becomes `9 + 9 * 999999999`.

The value of `dp[n, k]` will thus be in the range of 90 to a number slightly less than 9 billion, depending on the exact value of `k`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10.
- `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 90 to slightly less than 9 billion, depending on `k`.
- `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 90 to slightly less than 9 billion, `i` is 1**
