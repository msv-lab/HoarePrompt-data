After carefully reviewing the code and the problem description, I initially think that the program does what the description says. The code seems to correctly calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.

However, after re-examining the code and the output hints, I noticed that the code does not handle the case where `l` is greater than `r`. Although the problem description states that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the code does not explicitly check for this condition. But, the output hint for function 2 does mention that if `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0. 

The code seems to be correct for all other cases. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number has at most `k` different digits, and the function `func_2` correctly calculates the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` that satisfy this condition.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`, for all valid inputs where `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Although the code does not explicitly check for the condition `l` <= `r`, the output hint for function 2 mentions that if `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0, which is a reasonable behavior.
