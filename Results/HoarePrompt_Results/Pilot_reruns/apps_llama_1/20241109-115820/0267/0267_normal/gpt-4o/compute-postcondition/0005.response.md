Let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code updates the value of `total_sum` by adding `num` to it and taking the modulus with `MOD`.

From the initial state, we know that `num` is `l + 1`. 

So, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (l + 1)) % MOD`.

The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: `l` is less than `r`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `(total_sum + (l + 1)) % MOD`, `num` is `l + 1`.

Output State: **`l` is less than `r`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `(total_sum + (l + 1)) % MOD`, `num` is `l + 1**
