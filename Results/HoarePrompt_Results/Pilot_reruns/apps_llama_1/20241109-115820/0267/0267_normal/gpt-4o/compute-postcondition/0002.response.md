`total_sum` is assigned the value `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The value of `total_sum` is 0, and the value of `num` is `l`. The value of `MOD` is unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. However, we can express it as `(0 + l) % MOD` which simplifies to `l % MOD`. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`.

Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`.**
