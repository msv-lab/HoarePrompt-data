To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
res += char
```

Here's the step-by-step impact of the code on the program:

- The value of `res` is updated by concatenating the value of `char` to the end of `res`.
- The initial value of `res` is 'a'.
- The value of `char` is 'a'.

So, when `res` and `char` are concatenated, the resulting value of `res` will be 'aa'.

The values of the other variables (`s` and `alphabet`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the input string with at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is the input string with at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.**
