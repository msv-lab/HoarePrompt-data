The code `s = input()` assigns a new value to the variable `s`, which is the input provided by the user. The initial state of `s` is a non-empty string consisting of only small English letters, but this state is overwritten by the new input.

Since the input can be any string, the output state of `s` is now an input string.

Output State: **`s` is an input string**
