According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet` variable. Since `alphabet` is already defined as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', it is guaranteed to have at least one character. Therefore, the loop will execute.

Before the loop starts, `s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `res` is an empty string. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string.

State: **`s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
