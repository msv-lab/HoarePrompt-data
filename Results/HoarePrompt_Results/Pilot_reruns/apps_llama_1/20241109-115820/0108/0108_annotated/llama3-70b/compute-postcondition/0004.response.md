The code `res += char` concatenates the value of `char` to the end of `res`. Since `res` is an empty string and `char` is 'a', the new value of `res` is 'a'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
