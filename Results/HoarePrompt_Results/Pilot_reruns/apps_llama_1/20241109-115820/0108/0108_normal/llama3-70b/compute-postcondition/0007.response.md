The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. The initial value of `res` is 'a' and the value of `char` is 'b'. 

So, the new value of `res` is 'a' + 'b' = 'ab'. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced with 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced with 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'.**
