To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement.

The loop statement is `for digit in digits:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the `digits` list.

According to the given state at the end of the previous iteration, `digits` has at least one more element, and `digit` is the next element in the list. This means that the loop can execute again.

However, to accurately represent the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `digit` to reflect that it is now the next element in the list.

The other states, such as `n`, `cube_faces`, `k`, `found`, and the function's return value, do not affect the loop's execution and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **The function either returns False or does not return anything, `n`, `cube_faces`, and `k` remain unchanged, `found` is False, `digits` has at least one more element, `digit` is the next next element in the list**
