According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. If `digits` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `digits` is a list of `k` characters representing the digits of `num`, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all `False`. However, these variables do not affect the execution of the loop. The variable `digit` is introduced in the loop, so its value needs to be adjusted to the first digit in the `digits` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of at least 1 character representing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all `False`, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `k` is at least 1**
