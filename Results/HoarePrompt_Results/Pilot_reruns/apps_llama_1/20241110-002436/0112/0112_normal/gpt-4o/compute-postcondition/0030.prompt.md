You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is a positive integer, and cube_faces is a list of lists of 6 integers each, representing the 6 faces of each cube, such that 0 <= cube_faces[i][j] <= 9 for all i and j.
```
def can_form_number(num):
```
Output: Case_1: If the `digits` list is not empty, the loop will execute and `used_cubes` will contain at least one more `True` value, `digits` will have at least one less element, and `found` will be `True` if a cube is found for each digit. If the `digits` list is empty, the loop will not execute. If there are no cubes that contain all the digits in the `digits` list, the function will return `False` at some point during the loop. Otherwise, the function will not return anything.

Case_2: If the `digits` list was not empty, `used_cubes` contains at least one more `True` value, `digits` has at least one less element, and `found` is `True` if a cube is found for each digit. If the `digits` list was empty, the state of the variables is unchanged. The function returns `True`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
