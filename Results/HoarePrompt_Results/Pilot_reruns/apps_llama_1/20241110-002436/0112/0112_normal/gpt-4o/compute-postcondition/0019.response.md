To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 2, and `n` is a positive integer and at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to at least 3, and `n` should be greater than or equal to 3.

The other states, such as `cube_faces`, `digits`, `k`, `used_cubes`, and `found`, do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of at least 1 character representing the digits of `num`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 3**
