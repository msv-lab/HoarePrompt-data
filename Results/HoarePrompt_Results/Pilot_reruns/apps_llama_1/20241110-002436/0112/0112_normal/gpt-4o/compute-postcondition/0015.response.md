The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, and `i` is at least 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of at least 1 character representing the digits of `num`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2, and `used_cubes[i]` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of at least 1 character representing the digits of `num`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2, and `used_cubes[i]` is `True**
