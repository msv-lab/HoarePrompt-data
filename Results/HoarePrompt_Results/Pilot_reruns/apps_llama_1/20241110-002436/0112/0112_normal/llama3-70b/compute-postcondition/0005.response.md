According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 sublist, `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique digit in the `cube` sublist. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 2 sublists, `cube` must be the second sublist in `cubes`, and `digits` must be a set containing the string representation of each unique digit in the new `cube` sublist.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cubes` is a list of at least 2 sublists, `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique digit in the new `cube` sublist**
