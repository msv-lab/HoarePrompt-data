Postcondition: ***If `cubes` is not empty, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique non-zero digit in all sublists of `cubes`. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. The presence or absence of '0' in the original set of digits has no effect on the final state of `digits` if `cubes` is empty, but if `cubes` is not empty, '0' is removed from `digits` if it exists.***
