The function reads an integer `n` and `n` sublists of integers from the user's input, creates a set of unique digits, removes the digit '0' if present, and prints the largest possible number formed by concatenating the remaining digits in descending order. If the input is invalid or the set of digits is empty, the function may raise an error or print an unexpected value.
