The `remove` method is called on the `digits` set to remove the string `'0'`. If `'0'` is present in the `digits` set, it will be removed. If `'0'` is not present in the `digits` set, a `KeyError` will be raised. However, since we are only asked to provide the output state, we will assume that the operation is successful.

If `cubes` is not empty, the `digits` set initially contains the string representation of each unique digit in all sublists of `cubes`. After removing `'0'`, the `digits` set will contain the string representation of each unique non-zero digit in all sublists of `cubes`.

If `cubes` is empty, the `digits` set remains an empty set, and removing `'0'` will not have any effect.

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representation of each unique non-zero digit in all sublists of `cubes`, or an empty set if `cubes` is empty**
