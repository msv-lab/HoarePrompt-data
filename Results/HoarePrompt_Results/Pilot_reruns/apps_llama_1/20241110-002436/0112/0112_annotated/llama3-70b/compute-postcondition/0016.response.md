Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I've analyzed the function's functionality.

The function `func` accepts no parameters but expects to receive input for multiple cubes internally. The input is expected to be in the following format:

- The first line contains an integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3`.
- Each of the next `n` lines contains a list of 6 integers representing a cube.

The function processes this input and forms a set of unique digits (`digits`) from all the integers in the input cubes. If the digit '0' is present in the set, it is removed. The remaining digits are then sorted in descending order and concatenated to form the maximum possible integer (`max_num`).

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

- The annotations do not explicitly mention what happens if the input is invalid (e.g., `n` is not between 1 and 3, or the input cubes do not contain exactly 6 integers each). The code does not seem to handle these cases explicitly.
- The annotations do not mention what happens if the input cubes contain only zeros. In this case, the `digits` set would be empty, and the `max_num` would not be formed correctly.
- The code does not handle the case where the input cubes contain non-integer values.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts input for multiple cubes internally, forms a set of unique digits from the input integers, removes the digit '0' if present, and forms the maximum possible integer by concatenating the remaining digits in descending order. However, the function does not handle invalid input, and its behavior is undefined for input cubes containing only zeros or non-integer values. **
