Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. However, the code does not take this into account when forming the set of unique digits. It simply removes the digit '0' if present, but does not consider the rotation restrictions.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7
```
The code will form the set of unique digits as {'1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'}. However, since Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa, the correct set of unique digits should be {'1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '7', '8'}.

The annotations also mention that the function does not handle invalid input, and its behavior is undefined for input cubes containing only zeros or non-integer values. This is another example of how the code does not follow the problem description.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by pointing out the potential issues with the code, such as not handling rotation restrictions and invalid input. However, I had to verify that these issues indeed exist by comparing the code with the problem description.
