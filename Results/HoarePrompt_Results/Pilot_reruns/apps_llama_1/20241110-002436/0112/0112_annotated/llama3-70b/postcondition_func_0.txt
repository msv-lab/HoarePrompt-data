The function accepts input for multiple cubes internally, forms a set of unique digits from the input integers, removes the digit '0' if present, and forms the maximum possible integer by concatenating the remaining digits in descending order. However, the function does not handle invalid input, and its behavior is undefined for input cubes containing only zeros or non-integer values.
