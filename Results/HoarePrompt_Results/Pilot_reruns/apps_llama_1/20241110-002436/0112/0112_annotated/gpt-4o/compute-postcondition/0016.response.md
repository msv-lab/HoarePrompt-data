The given code snippet is simply an assignment statement that sets the value of `found` to `True`. However, according to the initial state, `found` is already `True`. Therefore, this assignment statement does not change the state of `found`.

The other variables are not affected by this assignment statement, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 2; `used_cubes` is either `[True, True, True]` or `[True, False, True]`; `found` is True**
