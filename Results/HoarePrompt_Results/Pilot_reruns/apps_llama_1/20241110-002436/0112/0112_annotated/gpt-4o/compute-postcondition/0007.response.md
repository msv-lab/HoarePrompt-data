Let's analyze the given code snippet.


The code snippet is a single statement: `break`. This statement breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


Now, let's check the previous values of the affected variables:


- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3
- `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers
- `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`
- `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where the first element is True and the rest are False
- `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list
- `found` is True
- `i` is 0


Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of all variables remain the same.


However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


Therefore, the Output State is:


Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where the first element is True and the rest are False, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
