The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of 6 integers for each of `n` rows, `cubes`, and returns the maximum value that can be formed using the numbers on the cube faces, assuming `n` is between 1 and 3 and `cubes` is a valid list. If `n` is not between 1 and 3 or `cubes` is not a valid list, the function may not work correctly or may raise an error. The function uses a separate function `can_form_number` to check if a number can be formed, but the conditions checked by this function are unclear.
