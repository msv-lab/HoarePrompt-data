The given code is simply `found = True`. However, according to the initial state, `found` is already `True`. Therefore, the code does not change the state of any variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 1; `used_cubes` is `[True, True]` if `n` is 2, or `[True, True, False]` if `n` is 3; `found` is True**
