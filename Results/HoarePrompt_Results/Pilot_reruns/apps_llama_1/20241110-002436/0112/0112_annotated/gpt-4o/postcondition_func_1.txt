The function accepts an integer `num` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and returns True if all digits of `num` can be found on the available cube faces, False otherwise. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative, `cube_faces` is empty or invalid, or `num` is not a positive integer.
