According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to False. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, the `digits` list must have at least 1 digit, and `digit` must be the first digit in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to False, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list**
