Based on the provided code and annotations, I will analyze the functionality of the `can_form_number` function.

The function accepts two parameters: `num` and `n`, where `n` is not explicitly defined in the code snippet. However, based on the annotations, it seems that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, and `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 9, inclusive.

The function converts the input `num` to a list of digits and then iterates over each digit. For each digit, it checks if the digit can be found on any of the available cube faces in `cube_faces`. If a digit is found on a cube face, the corresponding cube is marked as used. If any digit cannot be found on any cube face, the function returns False.

If the function completes the iteration over all digits without returning False, it returns True.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The code does not handle the case where `n` is negative. In this case, the loop will not execute, and the function will return True, but the state of the variables will remain unchanged.
* The code does not handle the case where `cube_faces` is empty or not a list of 6-element lists of integers.
* The code does not handle the case where `num` is not a positive integer.

Based on the code and annotations, I will provide a concise summary of the function's functionality:

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and returns True if all digits of `num` can be found on the available cube faces, False otherwise. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative, `cube_faces` is empty or invalid, or `num` is not a positive integer. **
