You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.

At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.

To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.

The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.

Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.


-----Input-----

In first line integer n is given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.

Each of next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) — number on j-th face of i-th cube.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximum number x such Masha can make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
87
Input
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

Output
98


-----Note-----

In the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3; `cubes` is a list of 6 integers for each of n rows, where each integer is between 0 and 9; `cube_faces` is a list of n sets, each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, with no duplicates.
    x = 0
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3; `cubes` is a list of 6 integers for each of n rows, where each integer is between 0 and 9; `cube_faces` is a list of n sets, each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, with no duplicates; `x` is 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of 6 integers for each of n rows, where each integer is between 0 and 9, `cube_faces` is a list of n sets, each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, with no duplicates, `x` is the maximum value that can be formed using the numbers on the cube faces
    return x
    #State of the program after the return statement: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of 6 integers for each of n rows, where each integer is between 0 and 9, `cube_faces` is a list of n sets, each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, with no duplicates, `x` is the maximum value that can be formed using the numbers on the cube faces, and the function returns `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of 6 integers for each of `n` rows, `cubes`, and returns the maximum value that can be formed using the numbers on the cube faces, assuming `n` is between 1 and 3 and `cubes` is a valid list. If `n` is not between 1 and 3 or `cubes` is not a valid list, the function may not work correctly or may raise an error. The function uses a separate function `can_form_number` to check if a number can be formed, but the conditions checked by this function are unclear.

#Function 2:
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 9, inclusive, and `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`.
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    #State of the program here: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 9, inclusive, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to False
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The function returns False if any digit in `digits` cannot be found on any of the available cube faces in `cube_faces`. If the function does not return False, `used_cubes` will have at least one True value for each digit in `digits` that was found on a cube face, and the remaining values will be False. The loop will not execute if `digits` is empty, and in this case, `used_cubes` will remain unchanged with all False values. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged, although the case where `n` is negative is not explicitly handled by the code.
    return True
    #State of the program after the return statement: The function returns True, and the state of the variables remains unchanged: `used_cubes` has at least one True value for each digit in `digits` that was found on a cube face, and the remaining values are False, or all values are False if `digits` is empty or `n` is 0 or negative.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an integer `num` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and returns True if all digits of `num` can be found on the available cube faces, False otherwise. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative, `cube_faces` is empty or invalid, or `num` is not a positive integer.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
