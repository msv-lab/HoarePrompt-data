To find the output state, we need to calculate the value of `max_lemons` based on the initial state of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The value of `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can express the output state in terms of these variables.

The output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
