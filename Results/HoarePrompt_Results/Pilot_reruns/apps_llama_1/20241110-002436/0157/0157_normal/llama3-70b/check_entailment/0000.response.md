Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The code calculates the minimum value among the input integers `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which represents the maximum number of lemons that can be used to cook the compote. It then prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which is the sum of the number of lemons, apples, and pears.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the calculation. The hints mention that the inputs are positive integers and do not cause an overflow error, which is consistent with the problem description.

After re-examining the code and the output hints, I did not find any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code correctly calculates the minimum value among the input integers and prints the total number of fruits that can be used.

The problem description provides examples that the code should handle correctly. For example, if the input is `2`, `5`, and `7`, the code should output `7`, which is correct. Similarly, if the input is `4`, `7`, and `13`, the code should output `21`, which is also correct.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
