The code prints the value of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This expression can be simplified to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which is `min_lemon * 7`. The value of `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, so the value of `min_lemon` is also an integer.

The print statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the function prints `min_lemon * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the function prints `min_lemon * 7`.**
