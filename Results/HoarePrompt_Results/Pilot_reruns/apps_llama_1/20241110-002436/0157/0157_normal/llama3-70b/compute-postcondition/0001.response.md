`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `b` is a positive integer, but it is overwritten by the new input value. The values of `a` and `c` are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
