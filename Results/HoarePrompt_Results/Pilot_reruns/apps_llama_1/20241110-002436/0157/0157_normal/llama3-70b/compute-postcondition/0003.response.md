To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code defines a new variable `min_lemon` and assigns it the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, their values are not specified. However, we can still express the output state in terms of these variables.

The value of `min_lemon` will be the smallest of the three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

So, the output state will be: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**
