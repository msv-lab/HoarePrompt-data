The function func accepts no parameters and uses three input integers a, b, and c. According to the code, it calculates the minimum among a, b // 2, and c // 4, and then calculates the total fruits as 7 times this minimum value. The function then prints this total fruits value.

However, the annotations do not mention what happens if the inputs are not positive integers. Looking at the code, it seems that the function will still work with non-positive integers, but the result might not be meaningful in this case.

Also, the annotations do not mention what happens if the inputs are not integers. Looking at the code, it seems that the function will raise a ValueError if the inputs are not integers.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate the minimum among a, b // 2, and c // 4, calculate the total fruits as 7 times this minimum value, and print this total fruits value, assuming that the inputs are integers. If the inputs are not integers, the function will raise a ValueError. If the inputs are not positive integers, the result might not be meaningful.
