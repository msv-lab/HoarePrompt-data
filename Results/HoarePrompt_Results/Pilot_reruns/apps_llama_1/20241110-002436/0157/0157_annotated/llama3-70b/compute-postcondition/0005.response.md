The function `func` does not seem to accept any parameters, as the function definition is `def func():`. However, the parameter constraints mention that a, b, and c are positive integers. This suggests that the function might actually accept three parameters, a, b, and c. 

If that's the case, the correct function definition would be:
```
def func(a, b, c):
```
Assuming that's correct, here's the functionality description:

The function `func` accepts three parameters, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. However, the output is not provided, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the input values.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integer parameters, a, b, and c. The return value is not specified.**
