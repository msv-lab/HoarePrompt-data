Let's think step by step:

The code `c = int(input())` assigns a new value to `c`. The previous value of `c` is a positive integer, but it is overwritten by the new value. The new value of `c` is an integer input by the user.

The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code, so they remain input integers.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
