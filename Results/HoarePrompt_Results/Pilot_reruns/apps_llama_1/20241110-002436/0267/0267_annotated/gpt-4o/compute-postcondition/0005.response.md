To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program.

The code is: `total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD`

From the initial state, we know that `num` is equal to `l + 1`. 

So, `total_sum` is assigned the value `(total_sum + (l + 1)) % MOD`.

Since `total_sum` is either 0 or `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, let's consider both cases:

1. If `total_sum` is 0, then it becomes `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, which is `(l + 1) % MOD`.

2. If `total_sum` is `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, then it becomes `((total_sum + l) % MOD + (l + 1)) % MOD`. This can be simplified to `(total_sum + 2*l + 1) % MOD`.

However, we cannot simplify it further without knowing the value of `MOD`. But we can say that `total_sum` is either `(l + 1) % MOD` or `(total_sum + 2*l + 1) % MOD`.

The states of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `k`, and `num`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is either `(l + 1) % MOD` or `(total_sum + 2*l + 1) % MOD`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is either `(l + 1) % MOD` or `(total_sum + 2*l + 1) % MOD**
