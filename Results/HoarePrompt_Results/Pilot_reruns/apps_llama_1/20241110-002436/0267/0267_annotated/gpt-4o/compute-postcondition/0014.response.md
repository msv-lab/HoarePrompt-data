The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10.

According to the code, the function calculates the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` is true, taken modulo `MOD`. However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. This is not explicitly handled in the annotations, but it is a possible scenario.
* The function uses `func_1(num, k)` as a condition, but the implementation of `func_1` is not provided. Therefore, the exact behavior of the function depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
* The function returns the sum modulo `MOD`, but the value of `MOD` is not defined in the provided code.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` is true, taken modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0. The exact behavior of the function depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the value of `MOD`. **
