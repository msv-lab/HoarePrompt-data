To calculate the output state, we need to know the value of `MOD`. However, since the value of `MOD` is not provided, we will assume it is a constant.

`total_sum` is assigned the value `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Initially, `total_sum` is 0 and `num` is equal to `l`. 

So, `total_sum` becomes `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`.**
