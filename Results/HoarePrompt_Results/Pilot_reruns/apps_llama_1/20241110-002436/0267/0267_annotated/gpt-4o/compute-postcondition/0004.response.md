To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is equal to `l`. For the loop to execute again, `num` must be incremented to the next value in the range.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num`. It should be incremented to `l + 1`.

The other states, `l`, `r`, `k`, and `total_sum`, do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, `total_sum` is either 0 or `(total_sum + l) % MOD`**
