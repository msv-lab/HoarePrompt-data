According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we know that `i` is in the range from 1 to `k`. Since the loop is using `range(1, k)`, we can infer that `i` is currently `k-1` (because the range is exclusive of the end value). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`, so `i` should be incremented to `k-1+1 = k`. However, since `i` is in the range from 1 to `k`, we know that `i` will be equal to `k` after the last iteration, but the loop will not execute again because `i` is not less than `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than its current value.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, `dp[n, k]` is `9 + 9 * (10**k - 1) // 9**i` is not valid anymore because `i` is not in the range of the loop anymore, `i` is `k`**
