The code updates the value of `dp` at key `(n, k)` to be `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, with dp[n, k] = n.**
