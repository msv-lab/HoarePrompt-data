The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers. 

The function has three possible return cases:

- Case 1: If `k` is 0, the function returns 0.
- Case 2: If `k` is not 0 and `(n, k)` is in `dp`, the function returns `dp[n, k]`. 
- Case 3: If none of the above conditions are met, the function's behavior is unspecified, but the values of `n`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged, and the function returns `dp[n, k]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and dp, and returns 0 if k is 0, dp[n, k] if (n, k) is in dp, and dp[n, k] otherwise.**
