Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers. If k is 0, the function returns 0. If (n, k) is in dp, the function returns dp[n, k]. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is set to n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is calculated as 9 plus the sum of 9 times 10 to the power of i minus 1 times 10 to the power of k minus i minus 1, for i ranging from 1 to k minus 1, plus the product of 10 to the power of k minus 1 minus 10 to the power of k minus 2 and n divided by 10 to the power of k minus 1 minus 1, then taken modulo MOD. The values of n, k, and dp remain unchanged in all cases.***
