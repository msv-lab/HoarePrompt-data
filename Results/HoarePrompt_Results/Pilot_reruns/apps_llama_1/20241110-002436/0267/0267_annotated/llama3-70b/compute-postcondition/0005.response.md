The code `dp[n, k] = 9` assigns the value 9 to the key `(n, k)` in the dictionary `dp`. 

The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. 

The dictionary `dp` now has an additional key-value pair `(n, k)` with a value of 9.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary where keys are tuples of non-negative integers and values are non-negative integers, and `dp[n, k]` is 9.**
