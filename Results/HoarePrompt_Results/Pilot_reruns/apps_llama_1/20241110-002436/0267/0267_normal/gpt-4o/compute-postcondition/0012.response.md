Based on the initial state, the code `return total_sum` returns the value of `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, modulo MOD. The state of the variables `l`, `r`, `num`, and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the left boundary of the range, `r` is the right boundary of the range, `num` is equal to `r`, `k` is the parameter for the function `func_1`, and the function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, modulo MOD.**
