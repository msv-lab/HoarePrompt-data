Let's analyze the code step by step.

The loop condition is `num in range(l, r + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is `l + 1` (since `num` is incremented by 1 in each iteration). To execute the loop one more time, `num` should be within the range `[l, r]`.

Since `num` is `l + 1`, we need to adjust the range to include `l + 1`. This means `l` should be updated to `l + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the values of `r`, `k`, and `total_sum` do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l + 1 <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`, `total_sum` is either `(l + 1) % MOD` or `((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD` if `func_1(l + 1, k)` is true, or remains either 0 or `l % MOD` if `func_1(l + 1, k)` is false**
