To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions that would allow the loop to run. The loop iterates over a range of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive), so for the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since we are already given that `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, this condition is already satisfied.

However, to make the loop execute at least once, we need to ensure that `l` is indeed less than or equal to `r`. This is already guaranteed by the given conditions. But to make it explicit and to define the state of `num` before the loop starts, we should adjust the state to reflect that `num` is equal to `l`, which is the first number in the range.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`**
