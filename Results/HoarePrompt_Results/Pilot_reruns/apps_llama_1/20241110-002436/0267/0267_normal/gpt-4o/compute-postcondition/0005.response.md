To solve this problem, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code is updating the `total_sum` variable by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus of the result with `MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10
- `total_sum` is 0 or `l % MOD`
- `num` is `l + 1`

We can calculate the new value of `total_sum` as follows:
- If `total_sum` is 0, then the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 1) % MOD`.
- If `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, then the new value of `total_sum` will be `((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD`.

Since `l` and `MOD` are unknown, we cannot simplify the expression further.

The output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is either `(l + 1) % MOD` or `((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is either `(l + 1) % MOD` or `((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD**
