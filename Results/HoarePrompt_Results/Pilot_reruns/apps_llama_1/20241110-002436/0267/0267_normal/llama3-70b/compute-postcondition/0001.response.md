Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary. If k equals 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function's behavior is unspecified, but n remains a non-negative integer, k remains a positive integer such that k <= 10, and dp remains a dictionary.***
