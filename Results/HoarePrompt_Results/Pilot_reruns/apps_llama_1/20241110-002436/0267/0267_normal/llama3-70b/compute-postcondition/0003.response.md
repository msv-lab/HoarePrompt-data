Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary. If (n, k) is a key in dp, the function returns the corresponding value dp[n, k]. Otherwise, the function's behavior is unspecified but n remains a non-negative integer, k remains a positive integer such that k <= 10, and dp remains a dictionary.***
