Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary. If (n, k) is a key in dp, the function returns the corresponding value dp[n, k]. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, then dp[n, k] is set to n. If n is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of k, then dp[n, k] is calculated as the sum of 9, the sum of 9 times 10 to the power of i-1 times 10 to the power of k-i minus 10 to the power of i-1 for i from 1 to k-1, and the product of 10 to the power of k-1 minus 10 to the power of k-2 and n divided by 10 to the power of k-1 minus 1, all modulo MOD. In both cases, the value of dp[n, k] is between 0 and MOD-1.***
