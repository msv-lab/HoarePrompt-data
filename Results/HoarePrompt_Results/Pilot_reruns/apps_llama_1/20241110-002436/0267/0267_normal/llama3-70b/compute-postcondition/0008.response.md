To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. 

Given the current state: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 1 and `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair `(n, k): 99 or 1008 or 10089 or 101089 or 1010089 or 10100089 or 101000089 or 1010000089, `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 1. However, the current state already guarantees that `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10. 

To execute the loop again, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.

The other states (`n`, `k`, and `dp`) do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 1 and `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair `(n, k): 99 or 1008 or 10089 or 101089 or 1010089 or 10100089 or 101000089 or 1010000089, `i` is 2**
