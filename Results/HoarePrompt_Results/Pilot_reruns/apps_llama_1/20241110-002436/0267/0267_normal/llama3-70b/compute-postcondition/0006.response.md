To ensure the loop can execute, we need to analyze the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(1, k):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 1.


State before the loop starts: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair `(n, k): 9`. However, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 1.


State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 1 and `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair `(n, k): 9, `i` is 1**
