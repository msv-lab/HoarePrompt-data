Based on the provided information, I will describe the functionality of the function.


The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is mentioned that a, b, and c are integers, which seems to be a contradiction. Since the function definition does not include any parameters, I will assume that the function does not accept any parameters.


Since there is no output information provided, I will leave the return value description empty.


Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unknown.**
