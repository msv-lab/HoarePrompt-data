The function accepts three integer inputs a, b, and c, and prints 'YES' if b equals a or if the difference between b and a is a non-negative multiple of c, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If c is zero, it prints 'NO'. If b is less than a and c is not zero, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
