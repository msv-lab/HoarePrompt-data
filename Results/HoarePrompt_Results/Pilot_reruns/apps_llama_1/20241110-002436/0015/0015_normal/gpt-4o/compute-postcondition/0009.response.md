The function func accepts three integer inputs a, b, and c. 

According to the annotations, the function prints 'YES' if b equals a or if the difference between b and a is a non-negative multiple of c. It prints 'NO' if c equals 0 or if the difference between b and a is not a non-negative multiple of c.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that the function does not handle the case where b is less than a and c is not zero. In this case, the function will print 'NO' because the difference between b and a is not a non-negative multiple of c.

Also, the function does not handle the case where c is zero and b is not equal to a. In this case, the function will print 'NO' because c equals 0.

The function does not return any value, it only prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console.
