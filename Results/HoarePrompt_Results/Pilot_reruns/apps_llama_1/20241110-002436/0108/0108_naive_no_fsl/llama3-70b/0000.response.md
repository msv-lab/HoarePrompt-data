Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the provided Python program and found that it correctly implements the problem description. The program iterates over the English alphabet and for each character, it replaces the first occurrence of that character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. This process is repeated until all characters of the alphabet have been processed.

The program then checks if the length of the resulting string is 26, which means that all characters of the alphabet have been found in the input string. If this condition is met, the program prints the resulting string; otherwise, it prints -1.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the following scenarios:

* The input string contains all characters of the alphabet in the correct order.
* The input string contains all characters of the alphabet, but not in the correct order.
* The input string does not contain all characters of the alphabet.
* The input string contains duplicate characters.
* The input string contains characters that are not in the English alphabet (although this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, the program ignores such characters).

Overall, I believe that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
