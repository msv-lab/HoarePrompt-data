To determine the loop's output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `if 'b' is in s then res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s` plus the number of times the loop executes.
- `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's and all 'b's replaced by 'c's.
- `char` is 'c'.

The given code is:
```python
while char in s:
    res += char
    s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)
```
This loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. In each iteration, `res` is appended with `char`, and the first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with the character that is one position ahead of `char` in the ASCII table.

The loop will terminate when `char` is no longer present in `s`. This can happen in two ways:

1. If `s` does not contain any 'c's initially (i.e., there were no 'b's in the original string), the loop will not execute at all.
2. If `s` contains 'c's, the loop will execute until all 'c's are replaced.

After the loop finishes, the state of the variables will be:

- `if 'b' is in s then res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in the updated `s` plus the number of times the loop executes.
- `s` is the updated input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, all 'b's replaced by 'c's, and all 'c's replaced by 'd's.
- `char` is still 'c', but it is no longer present in `s`.

Considering the edge cases:

- If `s` does not contain any 'b's initially, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged.
- If `s` contains 'c's, the loop will execute until all 'c's are replaced.

Output State: **`if 'b' is in s then res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in the updated `s` plus the number of times the loop executes, `s` is the updated input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, all 'b's replaced by 'c's, and all 'c's replaced by 'd's, `char` is 'c', and if `s` does not contain any 'b's initially then the loop does not execute and `res` remains unchanged.**
