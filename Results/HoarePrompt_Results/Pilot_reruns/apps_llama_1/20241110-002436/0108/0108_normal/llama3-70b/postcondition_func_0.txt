The function accepts no parameters, takes an input string from the user, replaces each character with the next character in the alphabet, and adds the replaced characters to a result string in alphabetical order. If the result string contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it prints the result string; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle empty input strings or non-alphabet characters, and in these cases, it will print -1.
