The `print(target)` statement prints the value of `target` but does not change the state of the variables. The values of `i` and `j` remain the same. 

Output State: **`i` is the minimum of `len(s)` and the position where `j` reaches `target_len`, `j` is the number of characters in `target` found in `s` in order, capped at `target_len`, and `target` has been printed**
