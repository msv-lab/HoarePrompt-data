Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged. `i` and `target_len` remain unchanged in both cases.***
