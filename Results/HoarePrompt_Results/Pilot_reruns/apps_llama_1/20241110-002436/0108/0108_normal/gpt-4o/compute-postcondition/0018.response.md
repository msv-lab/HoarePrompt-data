The code `print(-1)` prints the value -1 to the console. This statement does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `j`. Therefore, the output state remains the same, and the value -1 is printed.

Output State: **`i` is the minimum of `len(s)` and the position where `j` reaches `target_len`, `j` is the number of characters in `target` found in `s` in order, capped at `target_len`, and the value -1 is printed**
