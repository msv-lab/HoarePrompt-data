Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code initializes two new variables `i` and `j` and assigns them the values 0.

The initial state is: `s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26

After executing the code, the new variables `i` and `j` are introduced with values 0. The other variables `s`, `target`, and `target_len` are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
