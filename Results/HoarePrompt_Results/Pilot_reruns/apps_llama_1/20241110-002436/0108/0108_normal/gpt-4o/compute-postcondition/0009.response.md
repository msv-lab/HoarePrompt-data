Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` is less than 26. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of `j` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is always incremented by 1, regardless of the match. The length of `s` is always greater than `i`, and `j` is always less than 26. If `j` reaches 26, it will not be incremented further, but this case is not explicitly handled in the given code. Additionally, if `s[i]` does not match `target[j]`, the code does not specify any further actions, implying that the program will continue with the next iteration.***
