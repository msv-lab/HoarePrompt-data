Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to transform the input string into a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The key insight is that it replaces each character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order, effectively "moving" the character to the next position in the alphabet. This process is repeated for each character in the alphabet, ensuring that the resulting string contains all the characters of the alphabet in the correct order.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string does not contain enough characters to form the alphabet subsequence, printing -1 in this case. It also correctly handles the case where the input string contains multiple occurrences of the same character, using the `replace` method with a count of 1 to replace only the first occurrence of each character.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
