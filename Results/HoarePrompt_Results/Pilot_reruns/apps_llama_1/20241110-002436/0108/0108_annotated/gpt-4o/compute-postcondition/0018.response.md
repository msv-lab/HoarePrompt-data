The code prints -1. The values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is equal to the minimum of `len(s)` and `target_len`, `j` is the number of characters in `s` that match the characters in `target` in order, and the function prints -1.
