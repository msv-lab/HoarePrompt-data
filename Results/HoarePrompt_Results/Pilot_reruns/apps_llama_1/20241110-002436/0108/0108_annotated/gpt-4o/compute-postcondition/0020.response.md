It seems like there is missing information about the output of the function. Please provide the output information so I can accurately describe the functionality of the function.


However, based on the given parameter constraints, I can start by describing the input parameters.


The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it is mentioned that there is a parameter constraint: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters.


Please provide the output information so I can complete the description of the function's functionality.
