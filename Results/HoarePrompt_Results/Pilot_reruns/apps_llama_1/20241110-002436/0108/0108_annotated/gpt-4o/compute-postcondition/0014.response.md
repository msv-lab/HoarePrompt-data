The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` was already increased by 2 from its original value, so the new value of `i` is 3 more than its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 2`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 3 from its original value. If the character at index `i - 2` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` retains its original value.

Output State: **`s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 2`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 3 from its original value. If the character at index `i - 2` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` retains its original value.**
