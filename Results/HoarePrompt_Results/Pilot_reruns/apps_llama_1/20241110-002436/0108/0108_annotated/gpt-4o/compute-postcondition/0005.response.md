Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26. If the character at the current position `i` in `s` matches the character at the current position `j` in `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `i` and `j` retaining their original values.***
