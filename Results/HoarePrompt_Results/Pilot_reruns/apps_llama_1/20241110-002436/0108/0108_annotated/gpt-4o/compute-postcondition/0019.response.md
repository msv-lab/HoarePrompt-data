Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is equal to the minimum of `len(s)` and `target_len`, `j` is the number of characters in `s` that match the characters in `target` in order. If `s` contains all characters of `target` in order, 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' is printed. If `s` does not contain all characters of `target` in order, or if `s` is an empty string or `target` is an empty string, the function prints -1.***
