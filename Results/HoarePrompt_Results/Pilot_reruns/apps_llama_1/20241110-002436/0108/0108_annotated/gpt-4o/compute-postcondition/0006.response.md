The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is not specified, so we can only say that `i` has been increased by 1. The values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `j` retains its original value**
