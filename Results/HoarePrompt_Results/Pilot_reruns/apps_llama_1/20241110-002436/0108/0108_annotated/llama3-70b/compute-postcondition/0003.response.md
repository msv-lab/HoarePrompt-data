According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` is already defined as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the loop will execute 26 times. 

Before the loop starts, `s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `res` is an empty string. However, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to include the fact that we are at the beginning of the `alphabet` string. 

State: **`s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
