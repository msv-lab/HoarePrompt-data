Postcondition: ***The program prints either the string `res` containing all characters from the input string `s` in the order of their appearance in the alphabet, or the value -1. If `res` is printed, `s` is empty or contains non-alphabet characters, and `char` is the last character in the alphabet. If -1 is printed, it indicates that `res` does not contain all alphabet characters, and `s` is empty or contains characters that are not in the alphabet, with `char` being the last character in the alphabet. Additionally, if the input string `s` is empty or does not contain any characters from the alphabet, the program prints -1.***
