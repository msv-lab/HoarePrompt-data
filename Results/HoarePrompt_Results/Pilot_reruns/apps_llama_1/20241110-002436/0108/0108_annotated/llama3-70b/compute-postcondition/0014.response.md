To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition.

The loop iterates over the `alphabet`, and the current state is given after the previous iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `char` is 'a'. For the loop to execute again, `char` needs to be the next character in the `alphabet`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **if `s` contains at least one 'a' then `res` is a string of 'a's equal to the number of 'a's in `s`, `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, `char` is 'b'. if `s` does not contain any 'a's then the loop doesn't execute and `res` remains an empty string, `s` remains the input string, `char` is 'b'.**
