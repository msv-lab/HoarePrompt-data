The code `res += char` concatenates the value of `char` to the end of `res`. The initial state is: `s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'. 

After executing the code, `res` will be 'a' because `res` was initially an empty string and 'a' is concatenated to it. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.**
