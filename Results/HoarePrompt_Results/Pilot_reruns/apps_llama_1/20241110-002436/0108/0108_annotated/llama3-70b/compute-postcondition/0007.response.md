To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced by 'b' and contains at least one 'a' beyond the first character
- `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `res` is 'a'
- `char` is 'a'

The code snippet is:
```python
res += char
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

- The `res` variable is being updated by concatenating the value of `char` to its current value.
- The value of `char` is 'a'.
- The value of `res` is 'a'.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `res` will be 'aa'.

The states of the other variables (`s` and `alphabet`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced by 'b' and contains at least one 'a' beyond the first character
- `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `res` is 'aa'
- `char` is 'a'

Output State: **`s` is the input string with the first 'a' replaced by 'b' and contains at least one 'a' beyond the first character, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.**
