To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of the string `res`. 

From the initial state, we know that `char` is 'b'. 

If `s` contains at least one 'a', then `res` is a string of 'a's equal to the number of 'a's in `s`. After executing the code, `res` will have an additional 'b' appended to it. 

If `s` does not contain any 'a's, then `res` remains an empty string. After executing the code, `res` will be 'b'.

The states of the other variables, `s` and `char`, are not affected by the code.

Therefore, the output state is: 

- If `s` contains at least one 'a', then `res` is a string of 'a's equal to the number of 'a's in `s` followed by 'b', `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, `char` is 'b'.
- If `s` does not contain any 'a's, then `res` is 'b', `s` remains the input string, `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **If `s` contains at least one 'a', then `res` is a string of 'a's equal to the number of 'a's in `s` followed by 'b', `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, `char` is 'b'. If `s` does not contain any 'a's, then `res` is 'b', `s` remains the input string, `char` is 'b'.**
