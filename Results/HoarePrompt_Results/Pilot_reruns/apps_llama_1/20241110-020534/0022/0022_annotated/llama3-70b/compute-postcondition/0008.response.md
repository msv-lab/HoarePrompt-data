Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code is a simple assignment statement: `is_spalindrome = False`.

This statement assigns the value `False` to the variable `is_spalindrome`. 

The initial state of the variables `s`, `n`, and `i` is not affected by this statement.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is `False`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is `False`.**
