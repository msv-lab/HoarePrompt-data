Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0. If the characters at the current positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in `s` do not match, then `is_spalindrome` is set to `False` and the loop is exited. Otherwise, the state of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, indicating that the substring of `s` from index `i` to `n - i - 1` is a palindrome. This condition holds for all values of `i` from 0 to the middle index of `s`.***
