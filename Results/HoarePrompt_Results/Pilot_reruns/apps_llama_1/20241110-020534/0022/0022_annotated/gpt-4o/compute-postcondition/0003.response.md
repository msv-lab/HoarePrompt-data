Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n-1-i` in `s`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function does not return `False` (i.e., it may return a value or continue executing), and the relationship between `s`, `n`, and `i` remains unchanged.***
