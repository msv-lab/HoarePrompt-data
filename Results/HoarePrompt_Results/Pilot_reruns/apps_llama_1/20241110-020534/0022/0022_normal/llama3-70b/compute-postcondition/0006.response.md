Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is at least 2. If the characters at the current position `i` and the corresponding position from the end of the string `n - i - 1` do not match, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, `is_spalindrome` remains True. After the execution, `i` is either 0 if the loop was terminated or has been incremented, and `is_spalindrome` accurately reflects whether the string is a palindrome up to the current position `i`.***
