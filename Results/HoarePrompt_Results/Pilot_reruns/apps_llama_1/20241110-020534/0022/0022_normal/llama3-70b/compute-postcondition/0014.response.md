Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * (`i` + 1) + 1, `i` is the incremented value. If the characters at the `i`th and `(n - i - 1)`th positions in `s` are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, the state of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, implying that the substring remains a potential palindrome.***
