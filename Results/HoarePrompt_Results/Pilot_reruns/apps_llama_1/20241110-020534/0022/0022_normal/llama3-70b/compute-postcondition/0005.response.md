The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
