Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` checks if the input string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string, moving towards the center. This approach correctly handles all possible edge cases, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with non-English letters.

The output hints seem to agree with the code, stating that the function returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise, considering all possible edge cases.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the problem description mentions that the string "aa" is not "s-palindrome" because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half. This implies that the string should be symmetric about the middle of the string, not just a palindrome.

The code, however, only checks if the string is a palindrome, without considering the symmetry about the middle of the string. Therefore, I believe that the code does not exactly follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.

A counterexample is the string "aa", which is a palindrome but not "s-palindrome" according to the problem description. The code would incorrectly return `True` for this input.
