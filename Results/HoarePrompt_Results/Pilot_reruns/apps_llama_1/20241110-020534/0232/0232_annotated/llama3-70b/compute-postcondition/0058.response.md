Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `j` is equal to `i`, `i` is some value, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is `colors[i]`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of the key `colors[i]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `found` remains False.***

Note: I've summarized the postcondition to cover all edge cases, including the scenario where the condition in the if statement is not met, in which case `found` remains False.
