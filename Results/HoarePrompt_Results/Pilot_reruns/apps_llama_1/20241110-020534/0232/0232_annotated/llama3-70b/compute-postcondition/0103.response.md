Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+2`, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is equal to the value of `colors[i+2]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 from its previous state, `window_counts[colors[i+3]]` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
