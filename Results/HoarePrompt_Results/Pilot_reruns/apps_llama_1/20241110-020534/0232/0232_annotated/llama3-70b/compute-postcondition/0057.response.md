The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `j` is equal to `i`, `i` is some value, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is `colors[i]`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of the key `colors[i]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
