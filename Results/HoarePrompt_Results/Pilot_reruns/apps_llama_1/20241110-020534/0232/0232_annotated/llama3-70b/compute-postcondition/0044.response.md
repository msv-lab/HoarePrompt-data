Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and the value is the count of each color, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `counts` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `color` is the third element in the `colors` list, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or its previous value plus 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is True and the innermost loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, `found` remains False.***
