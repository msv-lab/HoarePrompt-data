Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is some value, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of the key `colors[i]` is incremented by 1 and the value of the key `colors[i + 1]` is either incremented or initialized to 0 if `colors[i + 1]` is not already a key in `window_counts`.***
