Output State: **`found` is `True`, `i` is some value, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `color` is `colors[i + 2]`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of the key `colors[i]` or `colors[i + 1]` is incremented by 1, and the value of the key `colors[i + 2]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
