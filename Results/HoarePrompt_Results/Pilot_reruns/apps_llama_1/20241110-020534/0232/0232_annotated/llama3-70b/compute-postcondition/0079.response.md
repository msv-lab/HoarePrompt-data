According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n` and `n` is a fixed value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`found` is False, `i` is `i+1`, `j` is `n-1`, `window_counts` is empty**
