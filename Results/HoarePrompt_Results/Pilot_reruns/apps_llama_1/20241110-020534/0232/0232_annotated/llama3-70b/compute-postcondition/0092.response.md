Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+1`, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is equal to the value of `colors[i+1]`, and `window_counts[colors[j+1]]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0; otherwise, its value remains unchanged.***
