Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+2`, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is equal to the value of `colors[i+2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is either incremented by 1 or initialized to 0 if it was not already in `window_counts`, while `window_counts[colors[i+3]]` remains unchanged.***
