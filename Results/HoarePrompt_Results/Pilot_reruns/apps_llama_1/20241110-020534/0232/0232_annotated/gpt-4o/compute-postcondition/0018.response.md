To calculate the output state, we analyze the given code snippet within the context of the provided initial state.

The initial state is as follows:
- `left` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed.
- `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by the number of times the loop executed.
- `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 2.
- `right` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Given the code snippet:
```python
current_counts[colors[right]] += 1
```
This line of code increments the value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` by 1.

Considering the initial state, `current_counts[colors[right]]` was already incremented by 2. Now, it will be incremented by an additional 1, making the total increment 3.

The values of `left`, `current_counts[colors[left]]`, and `n` are not directly affected by this line of code. The value of `right` remains 2 as it is not modified.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `left` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed.
- `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by the number of times the loop executed.
- `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 3.
- `right` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`left` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by the number of times the loop executed, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 3, `right` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
