Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 colors, `counts` is a list of integers, and `color` is the second color in the `colors` list. If `color` is not in `color_counts`, `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0; otherwise, `color_counts[color]` retains its previous value.***
