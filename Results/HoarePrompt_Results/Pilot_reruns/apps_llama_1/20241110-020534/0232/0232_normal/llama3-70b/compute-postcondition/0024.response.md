Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `color` is the first element of the `colors` list. The dictionary `window_counts` has a key-value pair where the key is the first element of the `colors` list and the value is 0 if the color was not already in `window_counts`; otherwise, `window_counts` remains unchanged.***
