The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `color` is the first element of the `colors` list, `window_counts` has a key-value pair where the key is the first element of the `colors` list and the value is 1 (if the color was not already in `window_counts`) or the previous value plus 1 (if the color was already in `window_counts`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
