The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `i`, `j` remain unchanged, `color` is the second element of the `colors` list, `window_counts` has a key-value pair where the key is `color` and the value is either 1 (if `color` was not already in `window_counts`) or the previous value plus 1 (if `color` was already in `window_counts`), and `found` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
