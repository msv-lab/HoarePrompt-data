Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts, `color` is the `(i+1)`-th color in the `colors` list, and `window_counts` dictionary has the count of the `(i+1)`-th color incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the target counts in `counts`, then `found` is set to `True` and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, `found` remains unchanged.***
