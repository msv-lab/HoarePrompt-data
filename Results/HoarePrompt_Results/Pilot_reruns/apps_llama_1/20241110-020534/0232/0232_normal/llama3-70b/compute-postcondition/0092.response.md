Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts, `found` remains unchanged, and `color` is the `(i+1)`-th color in the `colors` list. The `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of the `i`-th color in the `colors` list is incremented by 1 if the color was already in the dictionary, otherwise the count of the `(i+1)`-th color is set to 0 if it was not present in the dictionary, maintaining the count of other colors unchanged.***
