Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts, `found` is `True`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of the `i`-th color in the `colors` list is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
