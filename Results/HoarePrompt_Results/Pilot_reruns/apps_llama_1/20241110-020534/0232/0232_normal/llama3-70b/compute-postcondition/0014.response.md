Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 colors, `counts` is a list of integers, `color` is the third color in the `colors` list, and `color_counts` is a dictionary that maps `color` to 0 if `color` was not already a key in `color_counts`, otherwise `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
