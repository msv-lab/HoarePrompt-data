Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, the value associated with the key `colors[i]` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1, the value associated with the key `colors[i + 1]` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1, `color` is `colors[i + 2]`, the value associated with the key `color` (`colors[i + 2]`) in `window_counts` is incremented by 2 if it already exists or set to 1 if it does not exist. If all counts in `window_counts` match the target counts, `found` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `found` remains unchanged.***
