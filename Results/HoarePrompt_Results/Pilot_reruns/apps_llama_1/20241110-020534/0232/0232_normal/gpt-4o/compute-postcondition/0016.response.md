To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and state.

The code increments the count of the color at index `right` in the `current_counts` list.

Given the state:

* `left` is the number of colors that have been decremented
* `current_counts` reflect the updated counts after the loop
* `right` is 1

Since `right` is 1, the code increments the count of the color at index 1 in the `current_counts` list.

The state of `left` is not affected by this code, so it remains the same.

The state of `current_counts` is updated, and the count of the color at index 1 is incremented by 1.

The state of `right` is not updated by this code, so it remains 1.

Output State: **`left` is the number of colors that have been decremented, `current_counts` reflect the updated counts with the color at index 1 incremented by 1, `right` is 1**
