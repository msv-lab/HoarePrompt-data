To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is: `remainder = n % 10`

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer

Now, let's think step by step:

- The code calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 using the modulus operator `%`.
- The result of this calculation is assigned to the variable `remainder`.
- The value of `n` is not changed by this operation.

Since `n` is an input integer, it can be any integer value. The remainder of `n` divided by 10 can be any integer from 0 to 9, depending on the last digit of `n`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9**
