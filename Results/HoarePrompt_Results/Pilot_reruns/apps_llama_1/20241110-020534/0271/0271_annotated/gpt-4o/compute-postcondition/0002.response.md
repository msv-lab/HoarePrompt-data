To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is: `result = n - remainder`

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9.

Now, let's think step by step:
1. The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`.
2. Since `n` is an input integer, its value can be any integer.
3. `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, so its value can range from 0 to 9.
4. Subtracting `remainder` from `n` will give us a value that depends on both `n` and `remainder`. Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can say that `result` will be an integer that is the difference between `n` and `remainder`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, and `result` is an integer that is the difference between `n` and `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, and `result` is an integer that is the difference between `n` and `remainder`.**
