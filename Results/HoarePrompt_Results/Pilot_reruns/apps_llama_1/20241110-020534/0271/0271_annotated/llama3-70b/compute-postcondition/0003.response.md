To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given Python code snippet.

The code snippet is `print(n + (10 - n % 10))`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `n % 10` calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10. This gives the last digit of the number `n`.
2. `10 - n % 10` subtracts the last digit from 10, effectively rounding up `n` to the nearest multiple of 10.
3. `n + (10 - n % 10)` adds `n` to the result of the previous step, which is equivalent to rounding up `n` to the nearest multiple of 10.

Since `n` is an input integer, let's consider a few examples:

* If `n` is 7, `n % 10` is 7, `10 - n % 10` is 3, and `n + (10 - n % 10)` is 10.
* If `n` is 12, `n % 10` is 2, `10 - n % 10` is 8, and `n + (10 - n % 10)` is 20.

In general, the expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` rounds up `n` to the nearest multiple of 10.

The `print` statement outputs the result of this expression.

Output State: **The program prints the input integer `n` rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.**
