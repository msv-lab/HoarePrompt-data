Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, if `n` is a multiple of 10, the program prints `n`. Otherwise, the program prints the input integer `n` rounded to the nearest multiple of 10; if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it is rounded down, otherwise it is rounded up.***
