The value of `max_downvotes` is assigned the value `y + z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, but their specific values are unknown. The value of `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`. 

After execution, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `min_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is an integer with the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is an integer with the value of `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `min_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is an integer with the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is an integer with the value of `y + z`.**
