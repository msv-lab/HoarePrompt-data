Based on the provided information, I will describe the functionality of the function.


The function `func` accepts parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.


However, since there is no output information provided, I will describe the functionality based on the input parameters only.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, and z, which are integers within the range of 0 to 100.**
