The code prints '+' but does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `min_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer with the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is an integer with the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is an integer with the value of `y + z`**
