The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems that the function is supposed to accept three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. Let's assume that the correct function definition is:
```
def func(x, y, z):
```
With this assumption, the function `func` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.

Unfortunately, the output of the function is not provided. Please provide the output details, and I will be happy to help you describe the functionality of the function.
