Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are three input integers. The program prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` equals 0, and '?' in all other cases, including when `x` equals `y` but `z` is not 0, or when `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but not greater than the sum of `y` and `z`.***
