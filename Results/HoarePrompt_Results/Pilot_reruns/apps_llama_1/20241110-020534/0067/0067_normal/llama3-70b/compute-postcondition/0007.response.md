Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, and their values are determined by the input string. If `x` equals `y`, then if `z` is 0, '0' is printed to the console; otherwise, '?' is printed to the console. If `x` does not equal `y`, '?' is printed to the console.***
