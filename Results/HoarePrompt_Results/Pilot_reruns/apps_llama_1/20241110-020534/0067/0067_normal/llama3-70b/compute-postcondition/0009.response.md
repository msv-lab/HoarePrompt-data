Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, and their values are determined by the input string. If `x` is greater than `y` plus `z`, '+' is printed to the console. If `x` is less than `y`, '-' is printed to the console. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '0' is printed to the console; otherwise, if `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is greater than `y` but not greater than `y` plus `z`, '?' is printed to the console.***
