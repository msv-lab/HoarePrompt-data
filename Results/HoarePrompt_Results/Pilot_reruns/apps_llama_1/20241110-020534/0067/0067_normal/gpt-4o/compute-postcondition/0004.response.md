Let's think step by step:

The code `max_downvotes = y + z` assigns a new value to the variable `max_downvotes`. 

The value of `y` is an input integer, and the value of `z` is also an input integer. 

So, the value of `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`, which is an input integer.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is an input integer equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`, `min_downvotes` is an input integer equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is an input integer equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`, `min_downvotes` is an input integer equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`.**
