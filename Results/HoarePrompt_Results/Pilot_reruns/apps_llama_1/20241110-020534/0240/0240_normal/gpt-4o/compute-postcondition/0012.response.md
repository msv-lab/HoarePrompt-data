To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given code and the current state.

The loop iterates over the permutations of the string `chars`, which is a non-empty string consisting of digits.

The current state is:

* `chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits
* `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits
* `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`
* `candidate` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, which is the next permutation of `chars`

For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` must exist. This means that the current permutation `perm` must not be the last permutation of `chars`.

Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, we can conclude that `perm` is not the last permutation of `chars`. Therefore, the next permutation of `chars` exists, and the loop can execute one more time.

The states that need to be adjusted are:

* `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` (which is already the case)
* `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars` (which is already the case)

The other states, `chars` and `sub`, do not need to be adjusted, as they are not affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, which is the next permutation of `chars`**

Note that the state of `candidate` being a valid number with respect to `sub` is not relevant to the loop iteration, as it only affects whether the function yields a value or not.
