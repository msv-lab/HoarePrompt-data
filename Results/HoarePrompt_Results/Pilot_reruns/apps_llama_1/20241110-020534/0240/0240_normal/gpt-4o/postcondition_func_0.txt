The function accepts a string of digits `s` and a substring `sub`, removes the occurrences of `sub` from `s`, generates a list of possible numbers using the remaining characters, and returns the smallest possible number. However, it may return incorrect results or raise errors if `sub` is not a substring of `s`, or if `s` or `sub` is an empty string. Additionally, the function's behavior depends on the unknown `generate_possible_numbers` function.
