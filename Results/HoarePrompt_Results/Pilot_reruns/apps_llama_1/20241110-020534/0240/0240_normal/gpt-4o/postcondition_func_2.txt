The function generates all permutations of the string `chars` and yields the permutations that are valid numbers based on the substring `sub`. If `chars` is empty or `sub` is empty, the function does not yield any values. If `chars` contains no digits or `sub` contains no digits, the function does not yield any values. If `chars` contains only one character or `sub` contains only one character, the function yields the original string if it is a valid number. If `chars` contains multiple characters and `sub` contains multiple characters, the function yields all permutations of `chars` that are valid numbers based on `sub`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `chars` or `sub` contains non-digit characters or leading zeroes, and it does not provide any error handling for these cases.
