Let's analyze the given code.

The code `candidate = ''.join(perm)` assigns a new value to the variable `candidate`. The `join()` method concatenates all the characters in the `perm` string into a single string, without any separators.

Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, the resulting `candidate` will also be a non-empty string consisting of digits.

The other variables, `chars` and `sub`, are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, which is the next permutation of `chars`.**
