To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for c in s:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`.

Given the current state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, contains all the digits of `t`, and has at least one more character after the current first character.
- `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits.
- `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`.
- `n` is a string that may be empty or contain characters from `s` and has an additional character `c` appended to it if `c` is in `t_set`, or remains unchanged if `c` is not in `t_set`.

Since the loop will execute again, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the first character of `s` has been processed.

- `s` should be updated to reflect that it has at least one fewer character than before, but it is still a non-empty string consisting only of digits and contains all the digits of `t`. Since we know it had at least one more character after the current first character, we can say it still has at least one character.
- `t` and `t_set` remain unchanged as their state does not depend on the loop iteration.
- `n`'s state depends on whether the processed character `c` was in `t_set` or not, but since we are considering the state for the next iteration, we do not need to specify `n`'s state in relation to the current character. Instead, we acknowledge that `n` may have been updated in the previous iteration but do not change its description for the next iteration's starting state.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, contains all the digits of `t`, `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`, `n` is a string that may be empty or contain characters from `s`.**
