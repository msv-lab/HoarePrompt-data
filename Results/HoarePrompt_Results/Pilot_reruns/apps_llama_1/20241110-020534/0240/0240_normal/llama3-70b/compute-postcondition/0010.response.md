Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, contains all the digits of `t`, and has at least one more character after the current first character, `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`. If the current character `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is a string that may be empty or contain characters from `s` and has an additional character `c` appended to it. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged. The overall state of `s`, `t`, and `t_set` remains the same after the execution of the if statement.***
