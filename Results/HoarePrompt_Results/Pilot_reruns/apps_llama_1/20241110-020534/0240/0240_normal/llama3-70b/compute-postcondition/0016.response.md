Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `t`, which are both non-empty strings consisting only of digits. The function creates a set `t_set` containing the unique digits of `t`.

The function then iterates over each character `c` in string `s` and appends it to a new string `n` if `c` is present in the set `t_set`. This means that `n` will contain all the digits of `s` that are also present in `t`.

After the loop, the function appends the entire string `t` to `n`. This means that `n` will now contain all the digits of `s` that are also present in `t`, followed by the entire string `t`.

Finally, the function returns the integer value of `n`.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and missing logic.

* If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `n` will remain an empty string. In this case, the function will raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert `n` to an integer.
* If `t` is empty, the set `t_set` will be empty, and the loop will not append any characters to `n`. In this case, the function will return the integer value of `t`, which is not the expected behavior.
* If `s` contains digits that are not present in `t`, these digits will not be included in `n`.
* If `t` contains duplicate digits, these duplicates will be removed when creating the set `t_set`.

Based on the code, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `t` consisting only of digits, where `s` contains all the digits of `t`, and returns an integer `n`. `n` is constructed by appending all the digits of `s` that are also present in `t`, followed by the entire string `t`. If `s` is empty, the function raises a `ValueError`. If `t` is empty, the function returns the integer value of `t`. If `s` contains digits not present in `t`, these digits are not included in `n`. If `t` contains duplicate digits, these duplicates are removed. **
