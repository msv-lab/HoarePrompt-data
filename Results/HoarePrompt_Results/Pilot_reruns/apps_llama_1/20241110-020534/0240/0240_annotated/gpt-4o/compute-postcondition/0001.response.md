The value of `candidate` is assigned the string formed by joining all the characters in `perm`. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, which is a non-empty string of digits, `candidate` will also be a non-empty string of digits. The values of `chars`, `sub`, and `perm` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in `perm`.**
