Let's analyze the given code snippet.


The code `candidate = ''.join(perm)` assigns a new value to the variable `candidate`. The `join()` function concatenates all the characters in the `perm` string into a single string.


Given the initial state, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations. Since `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is also a non-empty string of digits.


Therefore, `candidate` is assigned the value of the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations.


The states of the other variables (`chars`, `sub`, and `perm`) are not affected by this assignment.


Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations**
