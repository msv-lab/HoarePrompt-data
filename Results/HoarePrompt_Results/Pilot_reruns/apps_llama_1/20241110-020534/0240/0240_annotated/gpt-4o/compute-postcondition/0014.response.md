The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, and `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`. 

Please provide the output cases for the function, as they are missing in the prompt. Once the output cases are provided, I can assist you in describing the functionality of the function.
