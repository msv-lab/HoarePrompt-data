Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number containing `sub` as a substring, the function yields `candidate`; otherwise, the function does not yield any value.***
