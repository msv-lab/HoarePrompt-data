Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the substring `sub` is not a substring of the string `s`. In this case, the function `func_1` will still return a smallest possible number, but this number may not be a valid solution because it does not contain the substring `sub`. 

The problem description states that Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number `n`, but it also implies that the restored number `n` must contain the substring `sub`. The code does not guarantee this condition.

Additionally, the function `is_valid_number` is incomplete and will raise a `NameError` when trying to access the undefined variable `n_len`. This function is supposed to check if a given number string is valid, but it does not work correctly.

The function `generate_possible_numbers` generates all permutations of a given string of digits `chars` and yields all valid numbers that contain a given substring `sub`. However, it relies on the function `is_valid_number` to check if a number is valid, which is incomplete and does not work correctly.

Overall, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
