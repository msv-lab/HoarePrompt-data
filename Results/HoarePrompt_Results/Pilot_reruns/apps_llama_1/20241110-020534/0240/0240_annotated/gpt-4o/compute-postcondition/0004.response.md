To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given code and state.

The loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The current state is:

* `chars` is a non-empty string of digits
* `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`
* `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`
* `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in `perm`

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider the next permutation of `chars`. Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, the next permutation will be different from the current one.

We don't need to adjust `chars` or `sub` because they are not changed by the loop. However, we need to adjust `perm` and `candidate` to reflect the next permutation.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of `perm`**

Note that we don't specify which permutation is next, as that depends on the specific implementation of the `permutations` function. The important thing is that `perm` and `candidate` are updated to reflect the next permutation.
