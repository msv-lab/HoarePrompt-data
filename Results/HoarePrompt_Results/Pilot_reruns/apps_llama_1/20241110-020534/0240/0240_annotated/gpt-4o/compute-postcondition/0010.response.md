The `yield` statement produces a value from a generator function. In this case, it yields the value of `candidate`. The state of the variables does not change, but the value of `candidate` is produced as output.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations, and `candidate` is yielded**
