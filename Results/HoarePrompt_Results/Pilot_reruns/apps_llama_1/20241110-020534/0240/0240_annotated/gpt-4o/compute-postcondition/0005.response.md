`candidate` is assigned the value formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of `perm`. Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of `perm`, `candidate` will be the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of the next permutation of `chars`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of the next permutation of `chars`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of the next permutation of `chars`.**
