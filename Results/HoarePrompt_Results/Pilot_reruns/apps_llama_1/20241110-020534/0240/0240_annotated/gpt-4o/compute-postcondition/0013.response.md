Based on the provided code and the initial state, I'll analyze the loop's functionality and determine its output state.

The loop generates all permutations of the input string `chars` and checks if each permutation forms a valid number that contains the substring `sub`. If a valid number is found, it is yielded.

Output State: **The loop generates all permutations of `chars` and yields all valid numbers that contain `sub` as a substring. If no valid numbers are found, the loop does not yield any values. If `chars` is empty or `sub` is not a substring of any permutation of `chars`, the loop does not execute.**

In more detail:

* If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits and `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, the loop will execute and yield all valid numbers that contain `sub` as a substring.
* If `chars` is empty or `sub` is not a substring of any permutation of `chars`, the loop will not execute, and no values will be yielded.
* After the loop executes, `perm` will be the last permutation of `chars` that was checked, and `candidate` will be the last valid number that was yielded (if any).
* If no valid numbers are found, `candidate` will be the last permutation of `chars` that was checked, but it will not be yielded.

The loop handles the case where `chars` is empty or `sub` is not a substring of any permutation of `chars` by not executing in these cases. However, it does not handle the case where `chars` or `sub` is not a string of digits. If `chars` or `sub` contains non-digit characters, the loop's behavior is undefined.
