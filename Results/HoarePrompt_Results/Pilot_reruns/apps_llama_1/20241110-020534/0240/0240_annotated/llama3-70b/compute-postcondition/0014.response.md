The function returns `int(n)`, and `n` is the original string `n` followed by the string `t`. The state of the variables `s`, `t`, `t_set`, and `n` does not change, but the function returns the integer value of `n`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is the original string `n` followed by the string `t`, and the function returns `int(n)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is the original string `n` followed by the string `t`, and the function returns `int(n)`.**
