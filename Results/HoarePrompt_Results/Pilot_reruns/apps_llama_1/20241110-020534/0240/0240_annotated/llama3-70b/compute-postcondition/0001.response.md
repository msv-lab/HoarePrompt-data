The code creates a new variable `n` and assigns it an empty string. This does not affect the values of `s`, `t`, or `t_set`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, and `n` is an empty string.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, and `n` is an empty string**
