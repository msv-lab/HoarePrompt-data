The code `n += c` appends the character `c` to the string `n`. Since `n` can be either an empty string, the first character of `s`, or the first character of `s` with one or more characters appended to it, the result of appending `c` to `n` will be a new string that is one character longer than `n`.

The values of `s`, `t`, and `t_set` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is either an empty string, the first character of `s`, or the first character of `s` with one or more characters appended to it, and one more character `c` appended to it.**
