Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 2 characters, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`. If the current character `c` is present in `t_set`, `n` is updated by appending `c` to it, otherwise `n` remains unchanged. The resulting `n` is either an empty string, the first character of `s`, or the first character of `s` with one or more characters appended to it, depending on the presence of characters in `t_set`.***
