The code `n += t` appends the string `t` to the end of the string `n`. 

Since `n` is a string consisting of the digits present in `s` that are also present in `t`, and `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, the value of `n` will be the original string `n` followed by the string `t`.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, and `n` is the original string `n` followed by the string `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, and `n` is the original string `n` followed by the string `t`.**
