Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`. If the character `c` is present in `t_set`, `n` is updated by appending `c` to it, resulting in `n` being either the first character of `s` with one or more characters appended to it. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged, retaining its previous state of being either an empty string, the first character of `s`, or the first character of `s` with one or more characters appended to it.***
