Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `t`, which are both non-empty strings consisting of digits.

The code first creates a set `t_set` containing the unique digits present in `t`.

Then, it initializes an empty string `n`.

The code then iterates over each character `c` in `s`. If `c` is present in `t_set`, it appends `c` to `n`.

After the loop, `n` is a string consisting of the digits present in `s` that are also present in `t`.

The code then appends `t` to `n`.

Finally, the function returns the integer value of the resulting string `n`.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `n` remains an empty string. In this case, appending `t` to `n` will result in `t` being returned as an integer.
* If `t` is empty, `t_set` is also empty, and the loop does not append any characters to `n`, resulting in `n` remaining an empty string. In this case, appending `t` to `n` will result in an empty string being returned as an integer, which will raise a `ValueError`.
* If `s` or `t` contains non-digit characters, the function will raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert the resulting string to an integer.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `t` consisting of digits, and returns the integer value of the string formed by appending `t` to the digits in `s` that are also present in `t`. If `s` is empty, it returns the integer value of `t`. If `t` is empty, it raises a `ValueError`. If `s` or `t` contains non-digit characters, it raises a `ValueError`. **
