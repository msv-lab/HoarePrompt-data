`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character in `s`. 

`n += c` means that `n` is assigned the value of `n` plus `c`. The value of `n` is an empty string, and `c` is the first character in `s`, so after execution, `n` is the first character in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is the first character in `s`, `c` is the first character in `s`.**
