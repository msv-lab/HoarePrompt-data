Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`. `i` remains 0. `n` remains greater than 0. `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated count value. `j` is equal to the current index in the loop. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a count value of 0 and then incremented. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks out. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and the initial state variables remain unchanged.***
