Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with the updated value of 1, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a value of 0. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding target counts, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited.***
