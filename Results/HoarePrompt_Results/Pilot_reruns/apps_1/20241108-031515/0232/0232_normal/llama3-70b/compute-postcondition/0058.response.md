Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`. `i` remains 0, `n` remains greater than 0. `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an incremented value. `j` is equal to `i`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[n-1] if `color` was not already assigned a value. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement in the code fragment.***
