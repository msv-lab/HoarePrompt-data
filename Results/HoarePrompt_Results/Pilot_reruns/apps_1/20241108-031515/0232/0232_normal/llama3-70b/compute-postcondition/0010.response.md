Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers with at least 1 color, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being between 1 and n, inclusive. If color is not already in color_counts, the color is added to color_counts with a value of 0. This ensures that all colors in the colors list have an entry in color_counts, either with a previous count or initialized to 0.***
