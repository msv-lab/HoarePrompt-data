Example Answer:
The dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, each color being in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being between 1 and n, inclusive, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, each color being in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being between 1 and n, inclusive, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
