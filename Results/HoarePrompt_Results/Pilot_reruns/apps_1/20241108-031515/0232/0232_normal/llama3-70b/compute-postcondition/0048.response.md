Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`. `i` is 0, `n` is 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary containing counts of colors, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[n-1]`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, and `color` is not assigned a value. After the if statement executes, the program will break out of the loop if `found` is True, maintaining the same state as before the if statement. If `found` is False, the program will continue with the subsequent code, if any.***
