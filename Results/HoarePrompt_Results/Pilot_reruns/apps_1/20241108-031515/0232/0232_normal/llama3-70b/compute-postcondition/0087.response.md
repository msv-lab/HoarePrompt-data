Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated count value of 1, `j` is equal to the current index in the loop, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary, `color` is added to `window_counts` with a count value of 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
