Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`. `i` is less than `n`. `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated count value based on the number of times `color` appears in `colors` within the range `i` to `n`. `j` is equal to the current index in the loop. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a count value of 1. The loop continues to iterate through `colors` until the condition for `found` is met. If the condition is never met, `found` remains True. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute and the initial state remains unchanged.***
