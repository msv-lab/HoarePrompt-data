According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated value, `j` is 2, `color` remains the same. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated value, `j` is less than `n`, `color` remains the same**
