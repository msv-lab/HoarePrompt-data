Output State: **If `s` contains `char`, then `res` will contain the characters of `alphabet` in sequence until `char`, `s` will be modified after each iteration. If `s` does not contain `char`, the loop does not execute and `res` remains empty. The loop will end when `char` exceeds the characters in `alphabet`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged.**
