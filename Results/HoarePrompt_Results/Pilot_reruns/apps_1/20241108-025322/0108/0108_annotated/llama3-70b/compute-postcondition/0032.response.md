Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to the end of the previous value of `res`. The previous value of `res` was a string concatenated with the replaced `char`, and `char` is still in `s`. After the execution, `res` will be updated with the new concatenated string.
Output State: **`res` is the updated string after adding `char` to it, `char` is still in `s`**
