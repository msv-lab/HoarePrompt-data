According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of `char` in `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has `char` added to it, and `s` is modified accordingly. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` must still be present in the modified `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` has `char` added to it, `s` is modified accordingly**
