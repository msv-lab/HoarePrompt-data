Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all characters in `alphabet` in order, `res` will be the string formed by replacing each character in `s` with the character that comes after it in `alphabet`. If `s` does not contain all characters in `alphabet` in order, `res` will be the string formed by replacing the characters in `s` with the character that comes after it in `alphabet` until the last character in `s`. If `s` does not contain any character in `alphabet`, `res` remains empty. If `s` is an empty string, `res` remains empty. In the if part, if the length of `res` is 26, it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1. In the else part, if the length of `res` is 26, it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1.***
