Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a string `s` as input and then iterates through the English alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces that character in the input string `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If the resulting string contains all characters of the alphabet in order, it prints the result. Otherwise, it prints -1. This logic follows the problem description accurately, as it aims to make some number of moves to transform the input string into a sequence of the English alphabet. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The provided examples also work correctly with the given implementation.
