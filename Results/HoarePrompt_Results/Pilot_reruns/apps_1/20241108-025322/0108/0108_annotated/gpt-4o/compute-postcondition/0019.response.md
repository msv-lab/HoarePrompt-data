Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is the length of s, `j` is the number of characters in s that match with the corresponding characters in target. If j equals target_len, then the function prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, the function prints -1. If the length of s is less than 26, the loop will end before j reaches 26. If the length of s is 26 or greater, the loop will continue until either all characters in s match with target or j reaches 26.***
