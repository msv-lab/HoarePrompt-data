Functionality: **The function reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5. It then iterates through `s` and compares it with the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If all characters in `s` match the corresponding characters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function handles cases where the length of `s` is less than 26 and where it is 26 or greater by checking the match of characters with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
