Example Answer: 
The value of `char` is added to `res`. Since `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last replacement, it is added to `res`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet and `char` is present in the modified `s`; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement, `char` is added to `res`**
