According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, the loop will definitely execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `char` takes on each character in the `alphabet` string during each iteration. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string**
