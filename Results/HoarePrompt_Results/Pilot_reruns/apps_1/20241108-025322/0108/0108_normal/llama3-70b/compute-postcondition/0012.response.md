According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char` and `char` is not the last character in the alphabet.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be present in the modified string `s` and it should have been replaced by the next character in the alphabet. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char` and `char` is not the last character in the alphabet**
