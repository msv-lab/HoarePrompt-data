Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the next character in the alphabet. Since `char` is added to `res` before the replacement, and `char` is the next character after the last replacement, the new value of `char` will be the character after the replacement. Therefore, the new state will be: `char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet and `char` is present in the modified `s`; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement, `char` is added to `res`.
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet and `char` is present in the modified `s`; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement, `char` is added to `res`**
