The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string. Since no other variables are affected by this code snippet, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string**
