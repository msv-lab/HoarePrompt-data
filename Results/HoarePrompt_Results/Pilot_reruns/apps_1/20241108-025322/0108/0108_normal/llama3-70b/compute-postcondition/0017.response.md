According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be present in the modified `s`.
State: **`char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet and `char` is present in the modified `s`; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement**
