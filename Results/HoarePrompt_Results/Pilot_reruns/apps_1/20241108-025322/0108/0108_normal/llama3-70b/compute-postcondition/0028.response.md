According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of `char` in string `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` will have `char` appended to it. This indicates that `char` was found in `s` at least once. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `char` should still be in `s` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`res` will have `char` appended to it**
