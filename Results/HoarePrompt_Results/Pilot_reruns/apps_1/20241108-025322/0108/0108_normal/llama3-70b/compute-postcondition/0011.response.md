Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced by the next character in the alphabet, which is obtained by incrementing the ASCII value of `char` by 1. The string `res` contains the character `char`, so after execution, `s` is updated with the replacement, and `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char` and `char` is not the last character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char` and `char` is not the last character in the alphabet**
