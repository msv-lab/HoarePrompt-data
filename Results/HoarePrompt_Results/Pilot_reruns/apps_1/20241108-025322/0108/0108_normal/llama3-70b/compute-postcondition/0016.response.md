Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet using `replace` function. The value of `char` is incremented by 1 using `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. After execution, the character `char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet. The Output State is: `char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement.
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement**
