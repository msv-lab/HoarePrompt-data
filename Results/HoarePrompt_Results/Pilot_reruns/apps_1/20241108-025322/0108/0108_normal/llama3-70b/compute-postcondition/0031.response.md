According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` will have `char` appended to it. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `char` is still in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` will have `char` appended to it**
