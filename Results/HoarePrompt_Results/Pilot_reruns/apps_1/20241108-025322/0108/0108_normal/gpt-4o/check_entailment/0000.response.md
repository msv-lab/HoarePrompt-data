Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code iterates through the input string `s` and checks if it contains all 26 letters of the alphabet in order. If it does, it prints out the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, which is the expected output. The code handles the case where the input string does not contain all the letters of the alphabet by printing `-1`, as required by the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correct.
