Postcondition: ***If the length of `s` is less than 26, the loop will stop execution before reaching the end of `target`. `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be the number of matching characters between `s` and `target`. If `s` contains all 26 letters of `target`, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be 26. In the if part, the program will print `target` if `j` equals `target_len`. Otherwise, in the else part, the program will print -1. This covers all possible cases and outcomes of the given program fragment.***
