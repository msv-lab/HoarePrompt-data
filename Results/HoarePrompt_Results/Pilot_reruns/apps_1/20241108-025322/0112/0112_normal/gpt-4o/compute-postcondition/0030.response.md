The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, where `num` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has. The function also expects the global variables `n` and `cube_faces` to be defined as described in the parameter constraints.

After executing the function body, there are two cases to consider:
- Case 1: If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will iterate through the cubes at least once. The function will check if there is at least one cube where a specific condition is met, and if so, the variable `found` will be set to True. If no cube satisfies the condition, `found` will remain False. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and no changes will be made to the variables. After the loop, if `found` is still False, the function will return False.
- Case 2: The same logic as Case 1 applies here, with the function returning False if `found` remains False after the loop execution.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a parameter `num`, representing the number of cubes Masha has, and check if any cube can form the given number based on certain conditions. If no cube satisfies the conditions, the function returns False.
