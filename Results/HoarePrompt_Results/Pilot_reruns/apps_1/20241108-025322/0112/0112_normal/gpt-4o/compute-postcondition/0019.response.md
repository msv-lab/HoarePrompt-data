According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is not satisfied in the previous iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where only the element at index `i` is True, `found` is True. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` must not be satisfied, which means `used_cubes[i]` at the current index `i` should not be True or `digit` should not be in `cube_faces[i]`. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where only the element at index `i` is True and `used_cubes[i]` at the current index `i` is False, `found` is True**
