According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more cubes in the list. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing '1', '2', '3', and cube is the first cube in the list. To execute one more time, the list of cubes must have at least 2 cubes and the cube variable should be pointing to the second cube in the list.
State: **n is greater than 0, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing '1', '2', '3', and cube is the second cube in the list**
