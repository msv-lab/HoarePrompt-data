According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 4 cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, 'cube' is the third cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 cubes and 'cube' is the fourth cube in the list.
State: **n is greater than 0, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 4 cubes, digits is a set containing '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '1', '2', '3', and 'cube' is the fourth cube in the list**
