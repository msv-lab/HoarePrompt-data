Example Answer: 
The code iterates over each digit in the first cube and converts it to a string to update the digits set. The cube variable represents the first cube in the list. Assuming the cube is [1, 2, 3], after execution, the digits set will be updated with the strings '1', '2', and '3'. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing '1', '2', '3', and cube is the first cube in the list.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing '1', '2', '3', and cube is the first cube in the list**
