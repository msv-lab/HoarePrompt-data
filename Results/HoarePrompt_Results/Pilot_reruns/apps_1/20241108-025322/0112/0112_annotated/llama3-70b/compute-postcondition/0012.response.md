Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop doesn't execute, and `digits` remains an empty set.***
