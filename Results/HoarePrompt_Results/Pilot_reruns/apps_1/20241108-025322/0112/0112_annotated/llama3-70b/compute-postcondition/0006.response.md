Example Answer:
The set `digits` is updated to include all the digits present in the `cube` list by converting each digit to a string. The `cube` list is the second list in the `cubes` list. Since `cube` is a list of integers, each digit is converted to a string and added to the `digits` set. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, `cube` is the second list in the `cubes` list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, `cube` is the second list in the `cubes` list**
