According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If there are more lists in the `cubes` list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, `cube` is the first list in the `cubes` list.

To execute the loop one more time, the `cubes` list must contain at least 2 lists. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, `cube` is the second list in the `cubes` list**
