According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more lists in the `cubes` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, and `cube` is the second list in the `cubes` list. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 3 lists in the `cubes` list, and `cube` should be the third list in the `cubes` list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing at least 3 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, `cube` is the third list in the `cubes` list**
