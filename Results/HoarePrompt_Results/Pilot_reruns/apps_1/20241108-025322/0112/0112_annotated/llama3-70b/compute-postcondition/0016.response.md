Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) from the input, then processes `n` lines, each containing 6 integers representing the faces of cubes. It creates a set `digits` that contains all the digits from the cubes. If '0' is present in `digits`, it removes it. The function then constructs an integer `max_num` by sorting the digits in descending order and prints it. The function does not return a specific value but performs these operations based on the input provided.
