According to the code, the loop can execute based on the number of lists present in the `cubes` list. Since `n` is a positive integer, it means there are at least 1 list present in `cubes`. Therefore, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `digits` set is empty, and we need to adjust it so that it contains all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list. Additionally, we need to set `cube` to the first list in the `cubes` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list, `cube` is the first list in the `cubes` list**
