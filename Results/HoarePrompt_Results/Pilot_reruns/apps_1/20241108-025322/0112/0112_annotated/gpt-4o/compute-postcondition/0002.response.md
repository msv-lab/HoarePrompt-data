According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `digits` has at least 1 digit. Before the loop starts, the variables `n`, `cube_faces`, `num`, and `used_cubes` do not directly affect the loop execution. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `digits` has at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values initialized to False, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`.**
