Output State: 
The loop iterates over each digit in the `digits` list and checks if there exists a cube in the `cube_faces` list that has not been used (`not used_cubes[i]`) and contains the digit. If such a cube is found, the corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a cube is not found for any digit, the loop returns False. The loop will execute at least once if `digits` has at least 1 digit and each digit can be matched with a cube. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute and returns False.
If the loop successfully iterates over all digits and finds a matching cube for each, it will set the corresponding values in `used_cubes` to True, ensuring each cube is used exactly once.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where each element is True if the cube is used, the loop successfully matches each digit with a cube. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute and returns False.**
