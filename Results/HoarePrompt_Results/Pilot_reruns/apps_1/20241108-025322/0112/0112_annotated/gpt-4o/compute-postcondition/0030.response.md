The function `can_form_number` accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer), `cube_faces` (a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on each face of the cube), and `num` (a positive integer representing the number Masha wants to form). The function also accepts `digits` (a list with at least 1 digit) and `used_cubes` (a list of n boolean values where each element is True if the cube is used).

In Case 1, if `digits` is not empty, the function successfully matches each digit with a cube by looping through the list of cube_faces. If all digits are successfully matched, the function returns True. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False.

In Case 2, the function behaves the same way as in Case 1, checking for a successful match of digits with cubes. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, a positive integer `num`, a list of digits `digits`, and a list of boolean values `used_cubes`. The function then checks if Masha can form the desired number by matching each digit with the numbers on the faces of the cubes. If successful, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
