Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Based on the problem description and the provided annotations, the functions `func_1` and `can_form_number` work together to determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes. The `can_form_number` function checks if Masha can form a specific number by matching each digit with the numbers on the faces of the cubes. The `func_1` function then increments x until Masha can no longer form the next number, thus finding the maximum number x that can be formed.

The annotations describe the behavior of the functions accurately, and there are no contradictions between the code, annotations, and problem description. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are consistent with the expected output of the program.

Therefore, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
