Example Answer:
The code converts the integer `num` into a list of its digits and assigns it to the variable `digits`. The previous values of the variables are n as a positive integer, cube_faces as a list of n lists, and num as a positive integer. After execution, the variable `digits` will contain a list of the digits of the number `num`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on each face of the cube, num is a positive integer representing the number Masha wants to form, digits is a list containing the digits of the number num**
