Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where the ith element is set to True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True if the condition is met, `i` is incremented by 1 up to `n-1` and the loop is broken. If the condition is not met, the program continues without any changes.***
