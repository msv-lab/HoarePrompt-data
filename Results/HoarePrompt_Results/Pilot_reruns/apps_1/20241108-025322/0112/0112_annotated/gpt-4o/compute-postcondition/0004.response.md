According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, so it ensures the loop can execute. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, so for the loop to execute successfully, `i` should start at 0 and increment up to `n-1`. Additionally, `num` is a positive integer and `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, so these conditions are already satisfied. The `used_cubes` list contains n boolean values initialized to False, so it ensures the loop can execute. The variable `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, so it is already set up correctly. The loop will only execute if `found` is False, as per the initial state.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values initialized to False, `digit` is the first digit in the list `digits`, `found` is False, `i` starts at 0 and increments up to `n-1`**
