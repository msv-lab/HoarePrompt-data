Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. One potential case where the program fails is when the cubes provided have duplicate digits. The current implementation does not handle the scenario where the same digit appears multiple times across different cubes, thus leading to incorrect results. For example, if Masha has cubes with faces: [0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 6], [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8], [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9], the program may not be able to correctly determine the maximum number x that can be formed.
