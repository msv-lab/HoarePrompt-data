Correctness: False

The given program does not handle the case where the digits 6 and 9 are used on different cubes. In the problem description, it is mentioned that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. However, the program does not check for this constraint. 

For example, if the input is:
```
2
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
```

The correct output should be 98 (as Masha can't make 68), but the program will output 98 as it does not consider the constraint of 6 and 9 being interchangeable. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
