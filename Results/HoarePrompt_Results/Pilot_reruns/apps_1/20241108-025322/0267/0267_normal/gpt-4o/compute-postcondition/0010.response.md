At the end of the last iteration, the state includes `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `(num + 1)` where `num` is incremented by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Increment `num` by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- Update `l` to be `(l + 1)` to move to the next number in the range.
- Update `r` to be the same as before as the loop condition `num in range(l, r + 1)` remains valid.
- If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, update `total_sum` to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.
State: **`total_sum`, `l + 1`, `r`, `(num + 1)`**
