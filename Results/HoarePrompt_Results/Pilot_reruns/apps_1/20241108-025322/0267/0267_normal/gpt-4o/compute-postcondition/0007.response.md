According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `(num + 1)`, where `num` is incremented by 1**
