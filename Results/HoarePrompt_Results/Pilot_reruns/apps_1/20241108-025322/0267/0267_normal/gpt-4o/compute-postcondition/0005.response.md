Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum` and `num` are known, so the new value of `total_sum` can be calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers with the updated value of `total_sum`.
Output State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers with the updated value of `total_sum`**
