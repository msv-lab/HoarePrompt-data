Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 10, dp is a dictionary storing the results of subproblems. If (n, k) is already in dp, the function returns the value stored at dp[n, k]. If (n, k) is not in dp, the function continues with its execution. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If n < 10^k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated by performing a series of calculations based on the values of n and k, including a loop for i in the range from 1 to k. The final value of dp[n, k] is taken modulo MOD to ensure the result is within the specified bounds.***
