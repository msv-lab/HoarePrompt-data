Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[n, k]` with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` and `MOD` are unknown, so the output state is: `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`**
