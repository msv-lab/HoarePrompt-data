According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 10, so it needs to be adjusted to k is greater than 1 and i is now 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary storing the results of subproblems, dp[n, k] is assigned the value 9, i is 1**
