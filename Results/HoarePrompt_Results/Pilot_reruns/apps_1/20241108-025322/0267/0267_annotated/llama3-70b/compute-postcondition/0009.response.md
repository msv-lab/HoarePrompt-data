Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. Since `i` is initially equal to `k`, the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated accordingly. The output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `i` is equal to `k`, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the given expression.
Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `i` is equal to `k`, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the given expression**
