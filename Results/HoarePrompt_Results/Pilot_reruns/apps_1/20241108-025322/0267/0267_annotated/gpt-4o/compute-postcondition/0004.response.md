According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, and `num` remain unchanged. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer after the current value.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the current `num` + 1**
