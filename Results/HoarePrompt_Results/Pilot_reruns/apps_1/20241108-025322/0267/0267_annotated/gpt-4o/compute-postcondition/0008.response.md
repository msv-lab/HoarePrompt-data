Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the current value of `num` and taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The value of `num` remains the same or is incremented based on the evaluation of `func_1(num + 1, k)`. The relationship between `total_sum`, `l`, and `num` is maintained. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to the current `num` + 1 or remains the same based on the evaluation of `func_1(num + 1, k)`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to the current `num` + 1 or remains the same based on the evaluation of `func_1(num + 1, k)`**
