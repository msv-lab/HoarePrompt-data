Example Answer:
The new value of `total_sum` is calculated by adding the current value of `total_sum` and `num`, then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is updated to be the current value of `num` plus 1. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is the new calculated value, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the updated value.
Output State: **`total_sum` is the new calculated value, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the updated value**
