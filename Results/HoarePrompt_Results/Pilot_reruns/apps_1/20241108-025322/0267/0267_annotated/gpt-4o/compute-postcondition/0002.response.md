Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is equal to `l`, so the new value of `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + l) % MOD`. The states of the other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated by adding `l` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
