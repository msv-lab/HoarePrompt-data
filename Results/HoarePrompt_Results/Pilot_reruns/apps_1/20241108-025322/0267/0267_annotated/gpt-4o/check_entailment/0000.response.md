Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions. 
- `func_1` checks if a given number `n` contains at most `k` different digits by converting `n` to a string, converting it to a set to get unique digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`. This function aligns with the problem description as it correctly determines if a number satisfies the condition of having at most `k` different digits.
- `func_2` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits. It does so by iterating through the range from `l` to `r`, checking each number using `func_1`, and updating the total sum accordingly. The modulo operation is applied to the total sum as required. This function also aligns with the problem description as it correctly calculates the sum of numbers meeting the criteria.

Overall, both functions work correctly as per the problem description, handling all potential cases and providing the expected output for the given examples.
