Output State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers. The loop iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive). If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for a particular `num`, then `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The relationship between `l`, `r`, and `num` is maintained with `l` being less than or equal to `r`, and `num` being updated accordingly. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for all numbers in the range, then `total_sum` remains 0. The function returns `total_sum`.**
