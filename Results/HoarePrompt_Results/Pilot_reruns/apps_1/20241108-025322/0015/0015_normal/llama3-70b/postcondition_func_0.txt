The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and based on the values of `c`, `a`, and `b`, it prints 'YES' if certain conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' in that case. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` to print 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
