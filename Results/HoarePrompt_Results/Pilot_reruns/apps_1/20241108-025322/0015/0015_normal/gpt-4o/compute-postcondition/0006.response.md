Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after mapping. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` is met, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program successfully handles all scenarios where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers after mapping, ensuring correct output based on the conditions `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, covering all possible edge cases.***
