The function reads three integer values a, b, and c from input, and then based on certain conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. If b is equal to a, it prints 'YES'. If c is equal to 0, it prints 'NO'. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code handles cases where a, b, and c are integers after mapping. However, it lacks explicit information on what happens if the input values are not integers or if the input process fails.
