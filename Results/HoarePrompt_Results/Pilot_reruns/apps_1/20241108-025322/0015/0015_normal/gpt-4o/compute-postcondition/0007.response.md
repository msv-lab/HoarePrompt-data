Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after mapping. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program handles all scenarios where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers after mapping, ensuring correct output based on the conditions `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, covering all possible edge cases such as when `c` is 0, or when the division of `(b - a)` by `c` is non-negative and yields a remainder of 0.***
