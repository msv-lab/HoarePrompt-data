Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers a, b, and c from input. It then checks various conditions involving a, b, and c. If b is equal to a, it prints 'YES'. If c is 0, it prints 'NO'. If (b - a) is divisible by c and the result of the division is non-negative, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function covers all possible cases including edge cases such as c being 0.**
