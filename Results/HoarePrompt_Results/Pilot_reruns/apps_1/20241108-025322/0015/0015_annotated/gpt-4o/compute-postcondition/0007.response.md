Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers within the valid range. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is 0, 'NO' is printed. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This covers all possible cases including the edge cases where `c` is 0 or the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is not satisfied.***
