Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` splits the input by whitespace, `int` converts each part to an integer, and `map` applies this to each part. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are determined by the input provided. 
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input**
