Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the difference between Vasya's favorite number and the first element of the sequence is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements of the sequence. It also checks if the result is non-negative. Therefore, the program outputs "YES" if Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence and "NO" otherwise. The logic covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
