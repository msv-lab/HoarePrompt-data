Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It first calculates the minimum number of sets of fruits that can be made based on the ratio of 1:2:4 (min_lemon), then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the min_lemon by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. This logic ensures that the ratio is maintained and the fruits are used optimally. The program handles all potential cases and adheres to the problem description.
