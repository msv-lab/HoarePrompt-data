Example Answer:
The minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` is stored in `min_lemon`. Then, the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` is calculated. Finally, the result is printed. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, and the result of the expression is printed**
