The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the predefined positive integer constraints of `a`, `b`, and `c` (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000). The function returns a specific result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the specific logic or conditions for the return value are not provided.
