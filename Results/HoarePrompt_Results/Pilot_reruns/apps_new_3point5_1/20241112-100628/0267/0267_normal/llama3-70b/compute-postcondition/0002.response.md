Example Answer:
The function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. Since there is no information provided on the values of n, k, or dp, we cannot determine the exact value being returned. Therefore, the output state is n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed results.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed results**
