Example Answer:
The value 9 is stored in the dictionary dp at the key (n, k). Since n and k are not specified in the code snippet, we cannot determine their values. However, we can say that the value 9 is stored in dp[(n, k)]. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed results with dp[(n, k)] = 9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed results with dp[(n, k)] = 9**
