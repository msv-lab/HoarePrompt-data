Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed results. If (n, k) is already in dp, the function returns the value stored at dp[n, k]. Otherwise, there is no change to n, k, or dp. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n.**
