The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `l, r, and k`, where `l, r, and k` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. The function calculates the result of (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. The function utilizes an empty dictionary `dp` in its calculations.
