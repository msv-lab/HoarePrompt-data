Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `count` is a helper function that calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits from 1 to $n$. The main function then calculates the sum by subtracting the count of numbers less than $l$ from the count of numbers less than or equal to $r$.

The implementation of the `count` function correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the cases where $n$ is less than $10^k$ separately and for larger values of $n$, it calculates the count using a formula based on the number of digits and the values of those digits.

The main function correctly calculates the required sum and returns the result modulo $998244353$. The input is correctly taken and the output is printed as expected. 

Overall, the program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
