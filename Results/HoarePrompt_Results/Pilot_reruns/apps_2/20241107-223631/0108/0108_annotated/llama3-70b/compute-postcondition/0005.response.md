Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character whose ASCII value is one more than `char`. The replacement is done only once. The length of the string `s` remains the same, but the character at the specified position is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with char replaced with chr(ord(char) + 1) once.
Output State: **`s` is a string with char replaced with chr(ord(char) + 1) once**
