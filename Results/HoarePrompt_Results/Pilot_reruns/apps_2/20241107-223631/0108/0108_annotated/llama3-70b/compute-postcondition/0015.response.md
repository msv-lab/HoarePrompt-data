Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char`, which is the next character in `s` that has not been modified yet. The previous value of `res` and `char` is unknown, so the output state is: `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement.
Output State: **`res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement**
