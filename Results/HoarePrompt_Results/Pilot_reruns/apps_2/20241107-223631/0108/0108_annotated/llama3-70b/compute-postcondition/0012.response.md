According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly, `res` is appended with the original value of `char`, and `char` is still in the modified string `s`. This indicates that `char` is indeed in `s`, so no adjustments need to be made to `char` or `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly, `res` is appended with the original value of `char`, and `char` is still in the modified string `s`**
