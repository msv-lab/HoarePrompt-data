Output State: **If any character in the alphabet is present in the string s, the loop will iterate through each character, replacing it with the next character in the alphabet and adding the original character to res. The loop will continue as long as the current character is present in s. If a character in the alphabet is not in s, the loop will not execute for that character. The final state will have res containing all the characters that were replaced in s, and s will have the characters replaced by their next alphabet character.**
