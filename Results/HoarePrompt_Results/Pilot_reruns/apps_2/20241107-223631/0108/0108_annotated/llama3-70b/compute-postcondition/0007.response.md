Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char`. The value of `char` is already defined as a character that exists in the modified string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with characters replaced with `chr(ord(char) + 1)` once, `char` is a character that exists in the modified string `s`, `res` is appended with the value of `char`.
Output State: **`s` is a string with characters replaced with `chr(ord(char) + 1)` once, `char` is a character that exists in the modified string `s`, `res` is appended with the value of `char`**
