Example Answer:
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in string `s` with the character that is one more than `char` based on ASCII values. The original value of `char` before replacement is stored in `res`, and then `char` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: if `char` is in `s`, then `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement, and `char` is further incremented by 1.
Output State: **if `char` is in `s`, then `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement, `char` is further incremented by 1**
