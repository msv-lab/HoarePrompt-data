According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `char` must still be present in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement**
