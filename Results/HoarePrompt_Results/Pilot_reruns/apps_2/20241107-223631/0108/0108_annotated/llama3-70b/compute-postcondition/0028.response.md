According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, and char is incremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` needs to be adjusted to its new incremented value after the previous iteration.
State: **if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is further incremented by 1**
