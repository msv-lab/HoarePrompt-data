Example Answer: 
The `char` in the string `s` is replaced by the character right after it in the ASCII sequence. The original value of `char` is contained in `res` before replacement, and the new value of `char` is present in `s`. The value of `char` is also incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement, `char` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `char` is present in string `s`.
Output State: **`res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement, `char` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `char` is present in string `s`**
