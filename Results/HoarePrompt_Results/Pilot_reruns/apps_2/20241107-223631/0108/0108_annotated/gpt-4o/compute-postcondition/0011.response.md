According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is adjusted based on the comparison of `s[i]` with `target[0]`, and if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` should be incremented by 1.
2. `j` should be updated based on the comparison of `s[i]` with `target[j]`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English lowercase letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 2 (since `i` is incremented by 1), `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `target[0]`, and if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1**
