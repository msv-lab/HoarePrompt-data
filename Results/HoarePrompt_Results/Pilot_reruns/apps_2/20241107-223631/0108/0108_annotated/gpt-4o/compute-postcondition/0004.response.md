Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of English lowercase letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English lowercase letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
