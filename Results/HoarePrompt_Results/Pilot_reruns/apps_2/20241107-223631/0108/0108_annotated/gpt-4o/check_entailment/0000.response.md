Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a string `s` as input and checks if the string contains all the letters of the English alphabet in order. If it does, it prints out 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', otherwise it prints -1. The program iterates through the characters of the input string `s` and compares them to the characters of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If all characters match in order, the program prints out the target string, otherwise it prints -1. The logic of the program matches the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it correct.
