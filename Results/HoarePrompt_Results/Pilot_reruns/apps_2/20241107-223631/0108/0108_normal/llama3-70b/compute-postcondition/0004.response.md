Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the end of the string `res`. The value of `char` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the string `res` will have an additional character at the end.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
