According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` contains the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to contain characters beyond `char` in the alphabet. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` contains the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration and `s` contains characters beyond `char` in the alphabet**
