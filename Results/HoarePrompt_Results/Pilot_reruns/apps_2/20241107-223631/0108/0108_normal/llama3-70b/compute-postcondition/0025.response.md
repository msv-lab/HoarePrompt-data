According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether the `char` is found in `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is found in `s`, `s` will contain the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, and `res` will contain characters appended in each iteration including `char`. If `char` is not found in `s`, the loop will not execute. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be found in `s` in the next iteration.
State: **If `char` is found in `s`, `s` will contain the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, and `res` will contain characters appended in each iteration including `char`.**
