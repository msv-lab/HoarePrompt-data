According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character. To ensure the loop can execute again, `char` needs to be in the updated `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
