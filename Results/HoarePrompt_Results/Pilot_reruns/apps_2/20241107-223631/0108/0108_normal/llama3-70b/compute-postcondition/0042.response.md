Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It then iterates through the alphabet, appending characters to `res` if they are found in `s` and replacing them with the next ASCII character in `s`. If the length of `res` reaches 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the predefined string `s`. If a character in the alphabet is not found in `s`, it remains unchanged. **
