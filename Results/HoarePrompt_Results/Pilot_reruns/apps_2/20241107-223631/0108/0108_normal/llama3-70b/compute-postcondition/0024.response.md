The loop will continue executing as long as `char` is found in `s`. In each iteration, `char` is appended to `res`, and the first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet.

If `char` is not found in `s`, the loop will not execute.

Output State: **If `char` is found in `s`, `s` will contain the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, and `res` will contain characters appended in each iteration including `char`. If `char` is not found in `s`, the loop will not execute.**
