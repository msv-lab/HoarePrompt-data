Example Answer: 
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. If `char` is found in `s`, `s` will be updated accordingly. The `res` variable is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: If `char` is found in `s`, `s` will contain the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, `res` will contain characters appended in each iteration including `char.
Output State: **If `char` is found in `s`, `s` will contain the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, and `res` will contain characters appended in each iteration including `char**
