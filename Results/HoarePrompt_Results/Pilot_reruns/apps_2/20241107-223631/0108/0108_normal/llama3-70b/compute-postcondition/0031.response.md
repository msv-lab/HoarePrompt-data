According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` has been appended to `res`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`char` is appended to `res` and `char` is in `s`**
