Example Answer: 
The character `char` is appended to the `res` variable in each iteration. The previous values of `res` and `char` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact result. Therefore, the output state is: `s` contains the next character in `alphabet`, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration.
Output State: **`s` contains the next character in `alphabet`, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration**
