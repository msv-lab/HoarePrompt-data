According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `s`, `j` needs to be less than the length of `target`, and `s[i]` should be equal to `target[j]`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than target_len, and s[i] is equal to target[j]**
