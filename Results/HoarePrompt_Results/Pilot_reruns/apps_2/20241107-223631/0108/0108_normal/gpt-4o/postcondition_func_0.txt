Functionality: The function `func` reads an input string `s` containing lowercase English letters. It then compares the characters in `s` with the predefined string `target = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. If the characters in `s` match the characters in `target` in the same order, it prints the entire `target` string. If there is a mismatch or if the length of `s` is less than the length of `target`, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value, and the output is provided through the print statements. It operates on strings of small English letters, ensuring the characters are matched in sequence with the target string.
