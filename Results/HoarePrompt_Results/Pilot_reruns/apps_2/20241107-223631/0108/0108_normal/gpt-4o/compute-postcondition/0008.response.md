The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 2, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 2, `j` is incremented by 1**
