Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an input string `s` and compares it with the target string `target = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
- It iterates through the characters in `s` and if they match the characters in `target` in the same order, it prints the entire `target` string.
- If there is a mismatch or if the length of `s` is less than the length of `target`, it prints -1.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
