Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The current value of `i` is 3, so `i - 1` is 2. The expression simplifies to `9 * 10 ** 2 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 10 ** 2)`, which further simplifies to `900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with updated values, i is 3, and the updated value of dp[n, k].
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with updated values, i is 3, and the updated value of dp[n, k]**
