According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n, k, and dp do not directly affect the loop execution, so they can remain unchanged. However, to ensure the loop executes, i should be initialized as 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store already computed values, i is 1**
