According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with updated values, i is 2**
