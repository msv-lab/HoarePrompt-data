Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store already computed values. If (n, k) is already a key in dp, the function returns the corresponding value stored in dp. If k is 0, the function returns 0. The variables remain unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
