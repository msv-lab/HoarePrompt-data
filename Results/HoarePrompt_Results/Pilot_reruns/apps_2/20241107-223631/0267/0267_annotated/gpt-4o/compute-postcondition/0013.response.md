The function `func_2` accepts parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. **Precondition**: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, `total_sum` is the sum of numbers satisfying the condition `func_1(num, k)` within the range [l, r] modulo `MOD`. `l` and `r` are updated based on the loop iteration, and `num` is updated for each iteration. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, calculate the sum of numbers within the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` modulo `MOD`, and update `l` and `r` based on the loop iteration.
