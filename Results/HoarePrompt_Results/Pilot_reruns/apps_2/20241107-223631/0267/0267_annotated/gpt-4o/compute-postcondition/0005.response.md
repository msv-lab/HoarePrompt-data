Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The value of `num` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. The output state is: `total_sum` is updated, `l` and `r` are updated based on the given conditions, and `num` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated, `l` and `r` are updated based on the given conditions, and `num` is updated accordingly**
