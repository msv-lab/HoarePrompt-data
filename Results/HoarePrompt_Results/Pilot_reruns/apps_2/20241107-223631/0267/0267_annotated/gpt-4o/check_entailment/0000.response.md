Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to solve the given problem.
- `func_1` checks if the number of unique digits in a given number `n` is less than or equal to `k`, which is a crucial step in the problem description.
- `func_2` calculates the sum of numbers within the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits in each number, as required by the problem description.
- The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases, as indicated by the annotations and the provided examples.
- Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
