Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for l, r, and k.
2. The program defines two functions, func_1 which checks if a number has at most k different digits and func_2 which calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that satisfy the condition in func_1.
3. The program iterates through all numbers from l to r and checks if each number satisfies the condition using func_1.
4. If a number satisfies the condition, it adds that number to the total sum modulo MOD.
5. The program then prints the final total sum modulo MOD, which is the correct output according to the problem description.
6. The logic implemented in the program is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
