Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `dp`, and `i` are given. After calculation, the new value of `dp[n, k]` is determined based on these values.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary with updated value at key (n,k), `i` is 2**
