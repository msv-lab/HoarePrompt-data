The function func_1 accepts three integer parameters l, r, and k. It calculates the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. The function utilizes a dictionary dp to store intermediate results during the calculation. The code snippet does not specify the implementation of the count function or the value of MOD, so additional context is needed to fully understand the functionality.
