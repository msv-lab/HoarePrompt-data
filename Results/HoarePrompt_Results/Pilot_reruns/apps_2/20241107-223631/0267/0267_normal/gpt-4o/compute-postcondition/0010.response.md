According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated by adding `(r - 1)` and applying modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `total_sum`, `l`, `r` remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num` needs to be less than `r`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r` are integers**
