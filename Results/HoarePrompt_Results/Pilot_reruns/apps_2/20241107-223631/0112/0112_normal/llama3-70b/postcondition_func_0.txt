Functionality: The function reads an integer n representing the number of cubes, with each cube represented by a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9. It then extracts all unique non-zero digits from all cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts these digits in descending order, joins them to form an integer, and prints the resulting max_num. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.
