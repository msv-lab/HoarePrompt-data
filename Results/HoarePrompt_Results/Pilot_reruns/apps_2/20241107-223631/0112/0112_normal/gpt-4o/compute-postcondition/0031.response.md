Functionality: ** The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num` and iterates through each digit in `digits`. It checks if each digit can be formed using a list of cube faces provided. If a cube containing the digit is found and has not been used before, it marks the cube as used. If no cube contains the digit or all cubes have been used, the function returns False. The loop will execute at most `n` times. If `digits` is empty or `n` is 0, the function returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine if the digits of `num` can be formed using the cube faces provided.**
