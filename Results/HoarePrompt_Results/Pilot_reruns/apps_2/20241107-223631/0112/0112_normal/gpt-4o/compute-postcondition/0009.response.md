According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, `found`, `i` are as described in the precondition. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, `found`, `i+1`**
