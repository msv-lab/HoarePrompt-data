To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of num with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with a length of n, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
