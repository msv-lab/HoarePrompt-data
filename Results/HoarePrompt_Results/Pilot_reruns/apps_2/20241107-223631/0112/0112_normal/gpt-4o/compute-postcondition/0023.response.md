According to the code, the loop will execute for each digit in the `digits` list up to `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed a certain digit. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next digit in the `digits` list needs to be considered. If `found` is not True after processing all digits, the function will return False.

State: **Depends on the specific situation of the previous iteration (which digit was processed, whether `found` was set to True, etc.)**
