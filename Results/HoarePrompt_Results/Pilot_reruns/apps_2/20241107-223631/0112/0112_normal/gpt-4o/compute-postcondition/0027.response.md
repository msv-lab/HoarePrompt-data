According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False and `digits` has at least one more element. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `found` state does not need to be adjusted, but the `digits` list must have at least one more element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least two more elements**
