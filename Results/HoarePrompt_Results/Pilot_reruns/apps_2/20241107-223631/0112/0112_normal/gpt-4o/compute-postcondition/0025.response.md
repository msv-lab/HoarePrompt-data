According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is set to False. To execute the loop one more time, the `digits` list must have at least one more element for the next iteration to occur.
State: **`found` is set to False, `digits` has at least one more element**
