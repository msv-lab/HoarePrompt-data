According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, `found`, `i+1` are in the given states. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. All other variables remain unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, `found`, `i+1` are in the given states. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. All other variables remain unchanged. `i` is less than `n+1`**
