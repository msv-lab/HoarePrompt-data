The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to generate and return a list of 6 integers, where each integer represents a randomly generated cube. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to generate and return a list of 6 integers representing a randomly generated cube for each cube in the range of 1 to 3.
Functionality: **The function generates and returns a list of 6 integers representing a randomly generated cube for each cube in the range of 1 to 3.**
