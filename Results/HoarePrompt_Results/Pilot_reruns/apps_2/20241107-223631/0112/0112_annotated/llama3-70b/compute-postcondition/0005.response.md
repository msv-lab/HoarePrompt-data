According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list of cubes. If there is at least one more cube in the list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube as strings, `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes.

To execute the loop one more time, the list of cubes must have at least 2 cubes. Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 cubes.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube as strings, `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes**
