Example Answer:
The code creates a list of lists called `cubes` by taking `n` lists of integers as input and splitting them. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, the number of lists created will be between 1 and 3. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists created from the input**
