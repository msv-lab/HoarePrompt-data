Example Answer:
The code updates the `digits` set to include the string representation of each digit in the first cube. Since `digits` is a set, each digit will be unique. The value of `n`, `cubes`, and `cube` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing unique string digits of the first cube, and `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing unique string digits of the first cube, and `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes**
