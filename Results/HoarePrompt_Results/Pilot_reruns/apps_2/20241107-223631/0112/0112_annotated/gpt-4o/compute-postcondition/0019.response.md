According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values with the value at index i set to True if not already set to True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `found` is set to True, and `i` is less than n. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values with the value at index i set to True if not already set to True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `found` is set to True, and `i` is less than n+1**
