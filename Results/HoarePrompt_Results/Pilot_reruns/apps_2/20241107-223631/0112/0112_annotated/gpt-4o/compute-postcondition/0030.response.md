The function `can_form_number` accepts three parameters: `n`, `cube_faces`, and `num`. `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, and `num` is a positive integer. 

After executing the function body, the function iterates over the cubes Masha has to check if any cube face contains the digit specified by `num`. If a cube with the digit is found, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

The function also updates the state of `n`, `cube_faces`, `used_cubes`, `found`, and `i` during the iteration process. The functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to determine if the specified digit can be formed using the faces of the cubes Masha has, and return True if it can be formed, or False if it cannot be formed.
