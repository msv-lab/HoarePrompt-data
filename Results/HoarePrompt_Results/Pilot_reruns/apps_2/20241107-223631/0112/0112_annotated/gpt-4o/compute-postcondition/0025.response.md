According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more digits to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is decremented by 1, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that the loop can still iterate through more digits. Therefore, the adjustment needed is that `n` should be decremented by 1 again.
State: **`n` is decremented by 2, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1**
