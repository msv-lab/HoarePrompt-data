Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. In the given examples, the code might work correctly. However, based on the annotations and the problem description, there are certain edge cases that the code does not handle correctly.

One such case is when Masha cannot make a number greater than 0 with the given cubes. The code does not check for this scenario and might incorrectly output a number greater than 0 even when it's not possible. This means the code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making the correctness of the code false.
