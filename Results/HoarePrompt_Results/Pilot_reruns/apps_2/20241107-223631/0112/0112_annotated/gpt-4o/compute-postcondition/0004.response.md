According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it should start from 0 as per the `range(n)` statement.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values initialized to False, `found` is initialized to False, `i` is 0**
