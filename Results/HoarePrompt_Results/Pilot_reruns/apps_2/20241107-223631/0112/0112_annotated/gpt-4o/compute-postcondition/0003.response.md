Example Answer:
The variable `found` is initialized to `False`. The other variables `n`, `cube_faces`, `num`, `digits`, and `used_cubes` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values initialized to False, `found` is initialized to False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values initialized to False, `found` is initialized to False**
