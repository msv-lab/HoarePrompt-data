Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values with the value at index i set to True if not already set to True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `found` is set to True, and `i` is less than n. If the condition not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i] is true, then used_cubes[i] is set to True, found is set to True, and the loop is exited.***
