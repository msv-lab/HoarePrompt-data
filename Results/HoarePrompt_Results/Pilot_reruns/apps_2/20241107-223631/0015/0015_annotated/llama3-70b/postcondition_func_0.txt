The function `func` reads three integer inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. It then checks the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine if certain conditions are met and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, it outputs 'YES'. If `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, it outputs 'YES'. If any of these conditions are not met, it outputs 'NO'. The function handles various edge cases related to the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` to provide the correct output based on the specified conditions. The function does not have a return value.
