Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It first checks if the difference between favorite number b and the first element a is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements c. If the difference is divisible and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES', indicating that b appears in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
