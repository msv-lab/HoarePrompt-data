The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and based on the conditions:
- If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, it prints 'YES'. 
- If `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, it prints 'NO'.
- If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` is satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, the code lacks input validation and error handling for cases where inappropriate input is provided such as non-integer inputs.
