Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If Vasya's favorite number `b` is equal to the first element of the sequence `a`, then the code prints 'YES' correctly.
- If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by the common difference `c` and the quotient is non-negative, the code also prints 'YES' correctly.
- If `c` is equal to 0, the code prints 'NO', which is correct as there would be an infinite sequence of the same numbers, and `b` would not appear in such a sequence.
- For all other cases where `b` does not appear in the sequence, the code correctly prints 'NO'.
