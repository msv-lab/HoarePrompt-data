The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the preconditions provided. The function will return the sum of the squares of the input parameters a, b, and c. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the sum of the squares of the positive integers a, b, and c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000.
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the sum of the squares of the positive integers a, b, and c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000.**
