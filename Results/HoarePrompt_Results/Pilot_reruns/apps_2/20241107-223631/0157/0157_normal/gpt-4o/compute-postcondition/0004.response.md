Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then `total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4. Since the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is calculated based on the value of `max_lemons`.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is calculated based on the value of `max_lemons`**
