Example Answer:
The variable `total_fruits` is calculated based on the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which is stored in `max_lemons`. The value of `total_fruits` is then printed. 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the total number of fruits is printed.**
