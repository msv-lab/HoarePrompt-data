Example Answer:
The value of `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, the result of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` is printed. The output state depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` provided as input.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` holds the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the printed output is the result of the calculation.**
