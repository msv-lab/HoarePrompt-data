Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in the appropriate variables. It then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checks if the counts of lightsabers in that interval match the given desired counts. If a match is found, it sets the 'found' flag to True and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it outputs 'YES' if a match was found and 'NO' otherwise. The program follows the problem description and logic provided, making it correct.
