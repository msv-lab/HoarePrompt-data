Example Answer:
The list `counts` is assigned the result of mapping the input to integers. The input contains a sequence of integers, and after mapping, the list `counts` will contain those integers. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of Jedi Knights, where each color is in the range from 1 to m, counts is a list of integers containing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color after mapping the input.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of Jedi Knights, where each color is in the range from 1 to m, counts is a list of integers containing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color after mapping the input**
