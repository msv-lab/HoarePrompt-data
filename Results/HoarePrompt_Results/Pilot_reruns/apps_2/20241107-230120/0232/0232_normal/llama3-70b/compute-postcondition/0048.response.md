Postcondition: ***The loop updates the `window_counts` dictionary with the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` to `n-1`. If a color is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with an initial count of 0 and then incremented by 1. The loop breaks if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute. When the condition `found` is true, the loop breaks without any changes to the variables.***
