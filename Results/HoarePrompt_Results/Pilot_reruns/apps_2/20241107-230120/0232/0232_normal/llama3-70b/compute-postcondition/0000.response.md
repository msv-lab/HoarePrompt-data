Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the first value from the input split as an integer and `m` is assigned the second value from the input split as an integer. The input is split by space into two parts. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of Jedi Knights, where each color is in the range from 1 to m, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, such that the sum of all counts is between 1 and n inclusive.
