Example Answer: 
The code snippet sets the value of `color_counts[color]` to 0 for a specific color. Since the initial state does not specify a particular color, the output state will have the same initial values for all variables except the updated `color_counts[color]` which will be set to 0 for a color that is not specified. 
Output State: **n and m are positive integers, colors is a list of at least n+1 integers representing the colors of the lightsabers, counts is a list of integers containing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, color_counts is a dictionary with color as key and value updated according to the code snippet**
