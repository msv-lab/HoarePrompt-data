Example Answer:
The dictionary `color_counts` is updated with the value 0 for the key `color`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers, colors is a list of at least n+2 integers, counts is a list of integers, color_counts is a dictionary with updated counts for each color where the specified color has a count of 0.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers, colors is a list of at least n+2 integers, counts is a list of integers, color_counts is a dictionary with updated counts for each color where the specified color has a count of 0**
