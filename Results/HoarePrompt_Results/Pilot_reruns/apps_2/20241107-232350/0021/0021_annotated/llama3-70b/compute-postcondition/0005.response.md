Example Answer:
`min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2. The values of `pos1` and `posn` are 1 and n-1 respectively. Therefore, the value of `min_dist` will be the minimum between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1, `posn` is n-1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2, `min_dist` is the minimum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2**
