Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist` and prints it. The value of `max_dist` is the maximum value between `abs(1 - n-1) - 1` and `n - 2`, and the value of `min_dist` is the minimum value between `abs(1 - n-1) - 1` and `n - 2`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the maximum and minimum distances can vary. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1, `posn` is n-1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2, `min_dist` is the minimum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2, and the code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1, `posn` is n-1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2, `min_dist` is the minimum value between abs(1 - n-1) - 1 and n - 2, and the code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`**
