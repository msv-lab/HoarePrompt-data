Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input values of `n` and `a`, finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the list `a`, calculates the distances between these elements and the ends of the array, and then prints the maximum distance achieved by swapping the minimum and maximum elements. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations do not highlight any issues that contradict the problem requirements. Therefore, we can conclude that the code is correct.
