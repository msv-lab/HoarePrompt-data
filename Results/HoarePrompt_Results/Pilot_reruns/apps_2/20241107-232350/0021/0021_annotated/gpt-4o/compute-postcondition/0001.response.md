Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The number of elements in the list `a` is equal to `n`, and the integers are distinct and range from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
