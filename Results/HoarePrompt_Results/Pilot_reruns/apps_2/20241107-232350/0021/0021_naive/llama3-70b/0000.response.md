Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap. It correctly finds the positions of the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n) in the array. Then it calculates the maximum distance by considering the absolute difference between their positions and subtracting 1. Finally, it prints the maximum distance. 

The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles scenarios where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array, where swapping them would increase the distance. Additionally, it handles cases where swapping would not increase the distance but still gives the correct output.
