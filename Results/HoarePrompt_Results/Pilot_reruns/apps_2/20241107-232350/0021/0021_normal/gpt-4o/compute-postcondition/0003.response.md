Example Answer: 
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the largest number in list `a`, which is `n`. Since the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the index of `n` is `n-1`. Therefore, `max_pos` is `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is `n-1`**
