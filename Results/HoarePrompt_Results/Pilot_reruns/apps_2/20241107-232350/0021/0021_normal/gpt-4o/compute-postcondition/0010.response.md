The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return True if the list `a` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n; otherwise, it returns False. The list `a` is assumed to contain n distinct integers from 1 to n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to check if the list `a` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns True if the list `a` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n; otherwise, it returns False.**
