Example Answer:
The index of the element 1 in list `a` is stored in `min_pos`. Since the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the index of 1 in the list `a` will always be 0. Therefore, `min_pos` will always be 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100 and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is 0**
