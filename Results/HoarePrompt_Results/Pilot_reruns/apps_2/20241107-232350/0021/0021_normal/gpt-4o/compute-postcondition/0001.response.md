Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from user input after converting them into integers using `map` and `split`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, where 2 <= `n` <= 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100 and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100 and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
