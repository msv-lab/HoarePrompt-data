Example Answer: 
The code finds the index of the integer 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to `pos1`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and n, and 1 is guaranteed to be in the list, `pos1` will be the index of 1 in the list `a`. The value of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in the list a**
