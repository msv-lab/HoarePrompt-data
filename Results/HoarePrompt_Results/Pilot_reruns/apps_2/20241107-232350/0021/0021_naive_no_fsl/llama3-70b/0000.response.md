Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, calculating the maximum possible distance between them, and considering the case when the minimum and maximum elements are adjacent. The logic provided in the code covers all possible scenarios and ensures that the maximum distance is achieved by performing exactly one swap. All the given examples from the problem description work correctly with the provided code.
