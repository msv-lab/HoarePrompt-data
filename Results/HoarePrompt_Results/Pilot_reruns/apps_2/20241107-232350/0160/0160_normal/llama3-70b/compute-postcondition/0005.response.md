According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, gcd is an integer between 1 and 10^6, `i` is 2, and gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the previous value of gcd and A[i]**
