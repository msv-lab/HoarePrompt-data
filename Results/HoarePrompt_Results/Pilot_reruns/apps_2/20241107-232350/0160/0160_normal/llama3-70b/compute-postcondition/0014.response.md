Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged, `gcd` remains 1, and `math.sqrt(gcd)` remains greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is updated, `N` and `K` remain unchanged, `gcd` is 1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated, `N` and `K` remain unchanged, `gcd` is 1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1**
