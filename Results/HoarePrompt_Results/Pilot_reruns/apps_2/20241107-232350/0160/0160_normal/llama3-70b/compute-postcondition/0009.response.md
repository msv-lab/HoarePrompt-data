According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, `i` is 4, and gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the previous value of gcd and A[2]**
