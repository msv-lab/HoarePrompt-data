Example Answer:
The variable `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the previous value of `gcd` and `A[2]`. Since `i` is 3, `A[i]` refers to `A[3]`. The `gcd` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, `i` is 3, and gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the previous value of gcd and A[2]**
