Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A` and 1. `i` is incremented by 1. `N` and `K` remain unchanged. `gcd` remains 1. `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. If `i` multiplied by itself is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.***
