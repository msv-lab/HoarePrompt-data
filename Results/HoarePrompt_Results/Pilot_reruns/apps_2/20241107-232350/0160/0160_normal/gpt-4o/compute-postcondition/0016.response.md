The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `x`. The precondition for `x` is that it is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 500. After executing the function body, the function calculates all the positive divisors of `x`, including 1 and `x` itself, and stores them in a set called `divisors`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `divisors` remains an empty set. The function then returns the sorted `divisors` set in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x`, calculate its positive divisors, and return them in reverse order.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, calculates all positive divisors of x, and returns them in reverse order.**
