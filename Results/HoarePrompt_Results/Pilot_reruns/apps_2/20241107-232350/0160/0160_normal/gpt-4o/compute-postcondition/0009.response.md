According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a positive integer and `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // 2, 2}. If `x` is divisible by 2, then the set `divisors` is updated to include the divisors 2 and x // 2 in addition to 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 and update the set `divisors` based on the conditions mentioned in the code.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // 2, 2}. If `x` is divisible by 2, then the set `divisors` is updated to include the divisors 2 and x // 2 in addition to 1. `i` is increased by 1.**
