Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, where `i` is increased by 1. The new value is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` initially contains {1, x // 2, 2, i}, the new value `x // i` is added to the set. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // 2, 2, i, x // i}, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // 2, 2, i, x // i}, `i` is increased by 1**
