According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the elements in list A, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **A is a list of N integers, K is a non-negative integer, gcd is the greatest common divisor of the elements in list A, i is 2**
