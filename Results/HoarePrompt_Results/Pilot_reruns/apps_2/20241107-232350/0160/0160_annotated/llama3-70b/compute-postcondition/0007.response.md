According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and the loop starts with `i` as 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **A is a list of N integers, K is a non-negative integer, gcd is the updated greatest common divisor, i is 3**
