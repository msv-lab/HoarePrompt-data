According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range provided is valid. In this case, the range is from 1 to the square root of `gcd`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `gcd` must be a positive number to ensure the square root is valid. Additionally, the variable `i` needs to be set to 1 as it starts from 1 in the loop. 
State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd` where `gcd` is a positive number, `i` is 1**
