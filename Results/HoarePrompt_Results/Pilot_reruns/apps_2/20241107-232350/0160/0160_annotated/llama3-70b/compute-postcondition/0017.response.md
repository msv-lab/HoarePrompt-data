According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd` where `gcd` is a positive number, `i` is 2**
