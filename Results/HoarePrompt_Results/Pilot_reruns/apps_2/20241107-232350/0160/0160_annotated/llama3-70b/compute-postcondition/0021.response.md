Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd` where `gcd` is a positive number, `i` is 2. If `gcd` is divisible by 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum between its initial value and the result of `gcd // 2`. Additionally, if `2 * 2` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum between its current value and the result of `gcd // 2`.***
