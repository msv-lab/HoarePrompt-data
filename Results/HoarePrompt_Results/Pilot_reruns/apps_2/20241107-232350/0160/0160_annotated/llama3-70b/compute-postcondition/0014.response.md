Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of the floor division between `gcd` and `i`. The previous values are not given, so we can't determine the exact value of `max_divisor`. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is updated to a new value based on the comparison between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`, `i` remains 1.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated to a new value based on the comparison between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`, `i` remains 1**
