According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **A is a list of N integers, K is a non-negative integer, updated `gcd`, and `i` is 4**
