The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The constraints for `x` are as follows: **Precondition**: **x is an integer such that x is a positive number. If x is 0 or negative, the function will handle these cases by returning an empty set for `divisors` and the sorted divisors in reverse order. The function returns a set `divisors` containing all the divisors of `x` when x is a positive number.**
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns a set containing all the divisors of x if x is positive. If x is 0 or negative, it returns an empty set and the sorted divisors in reverse order.**
