Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, obtained by adding both the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`, where `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where x % i == 0. The set `divisors` includes all unique divisors of `x` after the execution of the program fragment, ensuring that all edge cases are handled appropriately.***
