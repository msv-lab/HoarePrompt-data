Example Answer:
`divisors` set is updated by adding the new value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new `i` will be added to the set `divisors`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including the divisors found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` and adding both the updated divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`, `i` is now incremented by 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including the divisors found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` and adding both the updated divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`, `i` is now incremented by 1**
