Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including the divisors found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` and adding both the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`, where `i` is incremented by 1. If x is divisible by `i`, `divisors` is updated to include the new divisor found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` as well as the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`. This process continues for all valid divisors of `x`, ensuring that `divisors` accurately represents all divisors of `x` after the execution of the if statement.***
