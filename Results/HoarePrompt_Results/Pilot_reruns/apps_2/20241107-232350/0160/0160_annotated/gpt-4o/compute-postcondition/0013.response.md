According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, obtained by adding both the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`, where `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where x % i == 0. The set `divisors` includes all unique divisors of `x` after the execution of the program fragment.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 and update the `divisors` set with the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` after the additional iteration, obtained by adding both the new divisor `i+1` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i+1`, where `i` is now incremented by 1**
