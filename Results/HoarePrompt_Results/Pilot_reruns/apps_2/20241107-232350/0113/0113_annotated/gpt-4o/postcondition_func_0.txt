The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the `multiplier` based on the value of `k`, which can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The function then returns the result of `n` multiplied by the `multiplier`. The function assumes `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
