Example Answer: 
`n` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `n` and `x` is unknown, so the output state is: x is a positive integer calculated as 10 to the power of `k`, `n` is incremented by 2 and `n % x` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **x is a positive integer calculated as 10 to the power of `k`, `n` is incremented by 2 and `n % x` is not equal to 0**
