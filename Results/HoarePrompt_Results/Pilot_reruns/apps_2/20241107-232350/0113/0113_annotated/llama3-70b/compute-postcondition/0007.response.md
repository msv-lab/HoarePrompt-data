According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `n % x != 0` is true. At the end of the last iteration, `n % x` is not equal to 0, which means the loop can execute again. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, the value of `n` needs to be adjusted so that `n % x` becomes equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **x is a positive integer calculated as 10 to the power of `k`, `n` is incremented by 2 and `n % x` is equal to 0**
