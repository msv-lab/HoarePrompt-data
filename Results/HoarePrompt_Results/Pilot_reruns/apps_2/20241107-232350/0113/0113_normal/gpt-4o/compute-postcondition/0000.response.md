Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where k can be any value between 0 and 8. Therefore, the value of `multiplier` will be 10^k. Since the initial state states that k is between 0 and 8, the value of multiplier will be between 1 and 100,000,000. Hence, the output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is a value between 1 and 100,000,000.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is a value between 1 and 100,000,000**
