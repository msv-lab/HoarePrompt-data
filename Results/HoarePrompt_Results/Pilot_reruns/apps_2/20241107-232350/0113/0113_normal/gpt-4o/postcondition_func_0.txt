The function func_1 accepts two positive integers n and k, calculates a multiplier, and computes the result x based on the formula provided. The function then returns the result x. The code correctly implements the functionality described in the annotations. It covers the case where n and k are within the specified ranges, and the multiplier is calculated correctly. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where math.gcd(n, multiplier) could potentially raise an exception if n or multiplier is 0. This edge case should be considered for completeness.
