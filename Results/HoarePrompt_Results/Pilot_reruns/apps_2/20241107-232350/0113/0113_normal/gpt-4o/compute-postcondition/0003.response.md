The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function calculates a multiplier value between 1 and 100,000,000, then computes the result `x` by multiplying `n` by (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of n and multiplier). Finally, the function returns the calculated value `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate a multiplier and compute the result `x` based on the given formula, and return the result `x`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and k, calculates a multiplier and computes the result x based on the formula, and returns the result x.**
