Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `k` are assigned by splitting the input based on spaces and converting them to integers. The value of `n` can range from 1 to 10^9, and the value of `k` can range from 0 to 8.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
