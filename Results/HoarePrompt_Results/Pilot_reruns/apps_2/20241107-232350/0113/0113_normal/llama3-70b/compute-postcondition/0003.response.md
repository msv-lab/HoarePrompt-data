According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `n % x` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer increased by 1 and `k` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be increased by 1 again so that `n` remains a positive integer, and `x` needs to be adjusted to the next higher value from the given options that is greater than the current value of `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer increased by 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is the next higher value from the given options that is greater than the current value of `x`**
