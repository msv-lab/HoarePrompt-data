Example Answer: 
`n` is incremented by 1, and since it is a positive integer, it increases by 2, so the new value of `n` is the previous value + 3. The variable `k` is not affected by the code. The variable `x` needs to be the next higher value from the given options that is greater than the current value of `x`, so the new value of `x` is the current value of `x` + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer increased by 3, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is the next higher value from the given options that is greater than the current value of `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer increased by 3, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is the next higher value from the given options that is greater than the current value of `x`**
