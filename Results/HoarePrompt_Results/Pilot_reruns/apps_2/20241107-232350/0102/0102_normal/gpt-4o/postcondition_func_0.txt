The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` in the range 0 to 99 and returns the string representation of the corresponding number based on the conditions provided. If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, it returns the string representation from the list `ones`. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, it returns the string representation from the list `teens`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, it returns the string representation from the list `tens`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, it concatenates the tens and ones place strings with a hyphen. If none of these conditions are met, the function does not change the state of the variables.
