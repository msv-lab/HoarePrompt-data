The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. The function also has a list `tens` containing strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90. After executing the function body:
- If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of the number at index `n` in the list `ones`.
- If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string value at index (n-10) in the list `teens`.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the string at the tens place of the given number.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function concatenates the string at the tens place with the string at the ones place separated by a hyphen.
- Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` in the range 0 to 99 and based on the conditions mentioned above, return the appropriate string representation of the tens place or combination of tens and ones place of the given number.
