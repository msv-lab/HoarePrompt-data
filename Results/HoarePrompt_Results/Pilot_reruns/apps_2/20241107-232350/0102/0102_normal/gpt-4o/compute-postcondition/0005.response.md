Example Answer:
The code returns the value at the index `n // 10` from the list `tens`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n // 10` will be between 0 and 9, which corresponds to the index of the tens place in the `tens` list. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90, and the function returns the string at the tens place of the given number.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90, and the function returns the string at the tens place of the given number**
