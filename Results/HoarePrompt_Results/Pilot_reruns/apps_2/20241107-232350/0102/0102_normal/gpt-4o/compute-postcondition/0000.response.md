Example Answer:
The list `ones` is assigned a list of strings representing the numbers from zero to nine. This assignment does not affect the value of `n` as it remains within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99.**
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99.**
