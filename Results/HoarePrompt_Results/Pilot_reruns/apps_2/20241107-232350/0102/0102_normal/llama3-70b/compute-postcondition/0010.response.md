Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes user input `s` representing a number between 0 and 99. Based on the value of `s`, the function prints out the corresponding English word for that number. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word from the `ones` list; if `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word from the `teens` list. For values of `s` 20 or greater, it constructs and prints a string using values from the `tens` and `ones` lists, considering if the number is a multiple of 10 or not.**
