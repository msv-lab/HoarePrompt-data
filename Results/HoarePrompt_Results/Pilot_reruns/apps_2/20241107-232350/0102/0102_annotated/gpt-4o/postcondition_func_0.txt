Functionality: The function func_1 accepts an integer parameter n and returns the corresponding string value based on the rules defined for `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` lists. If n is between 0 and 9 (inclusive), the function returns the corresponding value from the `ones` list. If n is between 11 and 19 (inclusive), the function returns the corresponding value from the `teens` list based on the input value n. If n is between 10 and 99 (inclusive), the function behaves as follows: if n is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding value from the `tens` list. Otherwise, the function concatenates the corresponding tens and ones values based on the input n. This concatenation accounts for various edge cases such as when n is 0, 10, 11, 19, 20, 21, 99, and all other boundary values.
