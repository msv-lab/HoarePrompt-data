Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly converts an integer score into its corresponding English word representation as requested in the problem description. The code covers all possible cases including single-digit numbers, teens, and tens. The annotations also confirm that the code handles edge cases such as when the input is 0, 10, 11, 19, 20, 21, 99, and other boundary values. Additionally, the code annotations provide insight into the state of the program at different points, confirming that the logic for converting the score is implemented correctly. Therefore, based on the code and the annotations, we can conclude that the program works as expected for all possible cases described in the problem statement.
