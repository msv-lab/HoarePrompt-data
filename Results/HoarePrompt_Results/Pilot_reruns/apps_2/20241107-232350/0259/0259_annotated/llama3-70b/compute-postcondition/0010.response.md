Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The previous contents of `buses` along with the newly appended tuple are updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the previous tuples along with the newly appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the previous tuples along with the newly appended tuple**
