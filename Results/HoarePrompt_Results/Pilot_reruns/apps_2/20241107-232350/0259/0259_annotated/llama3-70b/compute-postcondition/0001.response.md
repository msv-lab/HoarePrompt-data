Example Answer:
An empty list `buses` is initialized. There are no changes to the initial state variables `n` and `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list**
