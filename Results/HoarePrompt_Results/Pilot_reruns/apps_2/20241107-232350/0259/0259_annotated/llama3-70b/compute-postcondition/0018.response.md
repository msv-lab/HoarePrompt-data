Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unknown in the initial state, so the output state is: `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, all other variables remain the same, `ans` is dependent on the value of `i`.
Output State: **`min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, all other variables remain the same, `ans` is dependent on the value of `i`**
