Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after being split. The `map` function converts the input values to integers. The variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, and `d` is an input integer**
