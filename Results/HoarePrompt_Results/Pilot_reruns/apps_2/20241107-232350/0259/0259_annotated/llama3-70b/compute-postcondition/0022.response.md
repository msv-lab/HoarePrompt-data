Example Answer:
`min_time` is assigned the value of `time`. Since the previous value of `min_time` is the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time`, `min_time` remains the same as `time`. The value of `ans` is updated to `i + 1`, but since the values of `i` and `ans` are not provided, the output state is: `min_time` is the same as `time`, `ans` is updated to `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the same as `time`, `ans` is updated to `i + 1`**
