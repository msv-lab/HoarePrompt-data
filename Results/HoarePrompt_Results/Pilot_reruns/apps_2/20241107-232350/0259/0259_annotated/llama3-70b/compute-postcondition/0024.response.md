Postcondition: ***`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the initial `min_time` and `time`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is set to `time` and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. In all other cases, including when `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, no changes are made to the variables.***
