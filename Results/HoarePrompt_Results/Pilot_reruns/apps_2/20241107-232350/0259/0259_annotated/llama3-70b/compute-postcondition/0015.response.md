According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 bus, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, min_time is positive infinity and ans is -1. So, for the loop to be executed, the buses list must have at least 1 bus, and i is 0, s and d are the values of the first bus in the list.
State: **`min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, buses is a list of buses with at least 1 bus, i is 0, s is the source of the first bus, d is the destination of the first bus**
