Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in the number of bus routes `n`, the time Serval goes to the station `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` containing the arrival time of the first bus and the interval between buses for each route. The code then iterates through each route, calculates the wait time for Serval for that route, and updates the chosen route based on the minimum wait time.

After analyzing both the code and the annotations, we can see that the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the correct wait time for Serval for each route and correctly determines the route with the minimum wait time, which aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the code is correct and the correctness is **True**.
