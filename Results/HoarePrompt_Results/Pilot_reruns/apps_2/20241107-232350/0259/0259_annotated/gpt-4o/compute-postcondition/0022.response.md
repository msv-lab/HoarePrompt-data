According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_wait_time` is set to the minimum of the calculated `wait_time`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `min_wait_time` is set to 0; otherwise, `min_wait_time` is set to the minimum of the calculated `wait_time`. In all cases, `chosen_route` is updated to either the route index `i + 1` if the condition is true or 3 if the condition is false. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, and `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i**
