Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring the proper handling of edge cases and maintaining consistency with the initial state.***
