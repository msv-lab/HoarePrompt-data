Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is either 0 or the minimum of the calculated `wait_time`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `min_wait_time` is 0, and `chosen_route` is 3. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, and `chosen_route` is updated to the route index `i + 1` if the condition is true or 3 if the condition is false. In all cases, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, and `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`.***
