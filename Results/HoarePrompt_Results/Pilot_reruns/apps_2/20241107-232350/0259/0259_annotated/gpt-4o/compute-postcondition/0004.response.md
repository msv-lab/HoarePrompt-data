Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated as the difference between the source of bus route `i` (`s_i`) and `t`. The initial state of `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, and `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`. Since the value of `t` is not given in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `wait_time`. Therefore, the output state is:  `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`**
