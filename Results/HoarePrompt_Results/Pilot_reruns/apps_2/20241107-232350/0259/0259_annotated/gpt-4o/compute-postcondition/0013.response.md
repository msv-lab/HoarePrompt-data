Example Answer: 
The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the source and destination of bus route `i` respectively. The values of `i` and `bus_routes` are not given, so the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is set to the minimum of the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to the route index `i + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is set to the minimum of the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to the route index `i + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`**
