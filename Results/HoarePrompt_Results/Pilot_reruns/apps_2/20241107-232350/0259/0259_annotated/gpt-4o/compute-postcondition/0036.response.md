Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes in three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` represents the number of bus routes, `t` is the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples with arrival times and intervals for each bus route. The function calculates the minimum wait time for each route based on the input parameters and returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` stays as -1. The function accurately determines the chosen route with the minimum wait time.**
