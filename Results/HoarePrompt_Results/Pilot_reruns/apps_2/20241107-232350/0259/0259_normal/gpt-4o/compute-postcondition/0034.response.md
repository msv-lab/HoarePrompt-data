Output State: **If n is 0 or bus_routes is an empty list, the loop does not execute. In this case, min_wait_time remains positive infinity, and chosen_route remains -1. If n is greater than 0 and bus_routes is not empty, the loop iterates through each tuple in bus_routes, calculates the wait_time based on the conditions provided, updates min_wait_time and chosen_route if necessary, and assigns the corresponding values to s_i, d_i, wait_time, min_wait_time, and chosen_route accordingly. Finally, the function returns the value of chosen_route.**
