Postcondition: ***`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `i` is one more than its previous value, `s_i` is assigned the value of the source from the bus_routes at index `i`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the destination from the bus_routes at index `i`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This covers all possible scenarios for the wait time calculation based on the conditions provided in the program fragment.***
