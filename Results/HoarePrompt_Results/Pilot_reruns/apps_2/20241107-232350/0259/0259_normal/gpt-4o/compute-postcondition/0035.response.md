The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route. 

After executing the function body, if `n` is 0 or `bus_routes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute. In this case, `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is greater than 0 and `bus_routes` is not empty, the loop iterates through each tuple in `bus_routes`, calculates the `wait_time` based on the conditions provided, updates `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` if necessary, and assigns the corresponding values to `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` accordingly. Finally, the function returns the value of `chosen_route`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and return the chosen route based on the calculated wait times and intervals of the buses.
