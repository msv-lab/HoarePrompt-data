Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated based on the source and destination of the ith bus route, as well as the current time `t`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` as a positive integer, `t` as a positive integer, `bus_routes` as a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` as positive infinity, `chosen_route` as -1, `i` as 0, `s_i` as the source of the ith bus route, and `d_i` as the destination of the ith bus route. The `wait_time` is calculated using the formula provided. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of the ith bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the ith bus route, `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided.**
