Example Answer:
The values of `s` and `d` are assigned using `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input, splits it, and converts it to integers. The values of `s` and `d` are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 1, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 1, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split**
