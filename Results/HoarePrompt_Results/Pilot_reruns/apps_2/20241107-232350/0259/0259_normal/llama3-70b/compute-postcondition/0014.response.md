Output State: After the loop executes, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)`, `_` is one less than `n`, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity. `ans` is assigned the value -1.
