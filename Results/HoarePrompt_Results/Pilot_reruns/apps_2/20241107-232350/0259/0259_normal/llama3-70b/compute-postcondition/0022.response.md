Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` with at least one more tuple, `_` is one less than `n`, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split, `min_time` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the tuple in `buses` that resulted in the minimum time. If there are multiple tuples with the same minimum time, `ans` will be assigned to the index of the first occurrence.**
