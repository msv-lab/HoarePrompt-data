Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers from a split. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)`, `_` is 1, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)`, `_` is 1, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split**
