Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the split input converted to integers. As the code snippet only appends a tuple to the list, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)`, `_` is 1, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the split input converted to integers, and a new tuple is added to the `buses` list.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)`, `_` is 1, `s` is the input integer from the split, `d` is the input integer from the split, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the split input converted to integers, and a new tuple is added to the `buses` list**
