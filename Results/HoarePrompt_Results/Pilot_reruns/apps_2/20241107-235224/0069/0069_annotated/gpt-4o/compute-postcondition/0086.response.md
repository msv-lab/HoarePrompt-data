Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where the `i-th` element is the sum of the `i-1-th` element and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1. `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`, `n` remains the same. If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length 1. After the if else block executes, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains -1; otherwise, `results` contains a single element 0. This holds true for all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
