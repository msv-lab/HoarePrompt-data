According to the code, the loop can execute if `_` is less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `T`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `_` needs to be adjusted to be less than `T+1`.
State: *`prefix_balances` is a list where the `i-th` element is the sum of the `i-1-th` element and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`, `n` remains the same, `_` is less than `T+1*
