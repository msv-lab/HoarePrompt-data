Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, then prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros. If x is in prefix_balances, results appends -1. If x is not in prefix_balances, results appends 0 if n is at least 1, and a single 0 is appended if n is 0.***
