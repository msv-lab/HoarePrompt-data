Example Answer:
`count` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: If n is at least 1, then prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros; `count` is 0.
Output State: **If n is at least 1, then prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros; `count` is 0**
