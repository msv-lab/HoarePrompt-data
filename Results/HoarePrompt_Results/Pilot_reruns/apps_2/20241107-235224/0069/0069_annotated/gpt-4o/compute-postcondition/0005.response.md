According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the variable `input` being assigned the function `sys.stdin.read` does not directly affect the loop execution. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `T` should be greater than 0, and `_` should start at 0.
State: **`input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, `T` is an integer value greater than 0 extracted from the first element of `data`, `_` is 0, `index` is assigned the value 1, `results` is an empty list**
