Output State: **The loop iterates over the results list and prints each result. If n is at least 1, prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index, balance is 0 or not 0, x is in prefix_balances or not, count is correctly incremented, and results contains the processed results. If n is 0, the loop doesn't execute and results remains empty.**
