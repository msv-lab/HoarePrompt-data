Output State: **If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length 1. If the loop does execute, `count` is incremented by 1 for each element in `prefix_balances` that satisfies the conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0.**
