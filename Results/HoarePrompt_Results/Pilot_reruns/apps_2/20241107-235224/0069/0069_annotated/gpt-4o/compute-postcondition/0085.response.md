Example Answer:
A new element 0 is appended to the list `results`. The list `prefix_balances` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list where the `i-th` element is the sum of the `i-1-th` element and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1. `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`, `n` remains the same. If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length 1; `results` contains a single element 0.
