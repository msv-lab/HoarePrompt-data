Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros. Count is increased by 1 if (x - b) is divisible by balance and the result is non-negative. In all cases, prefix_balances has at least 2 elements, and b is the second element in the list.***
