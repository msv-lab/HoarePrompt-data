Correctness: False

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x.

The code calculates the balance of each prefix of the string s and then checks if the desired balance x is present in the list of prefix balances. If x is found in the prefix balances list, the code incorrectly appends -1 to the results list, when it should instead append the count of prefixes with the desired balance.

Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case where there is an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. Instead of returning -1 in such cases, the code should correctly identify and handle this scenario.

Therefore, based on the discrepancies between the code logic and the problem description, the correctness of the code is False.
