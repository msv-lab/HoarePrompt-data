Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ as described in the problem statement. It handles cases where the balance equals $x$ by printing $n+1$, cases where there is an infinite number of prefixes by printing -1, and other cases by calculating the number of prefixes accordingly. The annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the code and cover the scenarios mentioned in the problem description. Thus, the code aligns with the problem requirements and provides the correct output for each test case.
