Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case correctly.
- For each test case, it calculates the balance of the given string `s` and checks if it matches the desired balance `x`.
- If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`, which corresponds to the length of the string `s`.
- If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is 0, it correctly prints -1 as there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance.
- Otherwise, it calculates and prints the number of prefixes with the desired balance correctly.
- The code handles different cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case.
- There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle, and the output hints also support the correctness of the code.
