Example Answer: 
`balance` is assigned the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are unknown, but they are presumably integers. Therefore, the output state is: T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting by space, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`.
Output State: **T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting by space, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1**
