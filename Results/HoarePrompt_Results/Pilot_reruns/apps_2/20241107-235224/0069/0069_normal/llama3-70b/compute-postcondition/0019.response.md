Postcondition: ***T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting by space. `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0`, `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. This covers all possible scenarios after the if-else block execution, ensuring the proper handling of edge cases.***
