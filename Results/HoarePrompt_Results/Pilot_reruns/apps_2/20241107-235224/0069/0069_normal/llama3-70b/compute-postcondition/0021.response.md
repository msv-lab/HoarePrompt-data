According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **T is incremented by 2, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from the input after splitting by space. `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, then the code prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the code prints -1. Otherwise, if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0`, the code prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.**
