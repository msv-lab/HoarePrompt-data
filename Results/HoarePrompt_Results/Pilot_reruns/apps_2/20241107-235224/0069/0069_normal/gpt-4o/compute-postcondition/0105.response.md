According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, appropriate conditions for `balance`, `x`, and `T` are met for `results` to be populated. To execute the loop one more time, the `results` list must still have more elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, appropriate conditions for `balance`, `x`, and `T` are met for `results` to be populated**
