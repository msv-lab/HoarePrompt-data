Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The variables `n`, `prefix_balances`, and `results` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `results` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `results` is an empty list**
