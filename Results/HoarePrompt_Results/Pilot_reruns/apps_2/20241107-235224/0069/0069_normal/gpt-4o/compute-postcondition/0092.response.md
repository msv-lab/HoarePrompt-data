Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 1. After execution, `count` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `count` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `count` is 2**
