Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data` at index + 1 is converted to an integer and assigned to `x`. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer that meets the loop condition for one more iteration, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
