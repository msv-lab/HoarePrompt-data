Example Answer: 
`results` is assigned the value `count`, where `count` is the total number of times the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` are satisfied. If `prefix_balances` is empty, `count` remains 0. Therefore, after execution, the value of `results` will be the count of valid cases.
Output State: **`results` contains the count of valid cases**
