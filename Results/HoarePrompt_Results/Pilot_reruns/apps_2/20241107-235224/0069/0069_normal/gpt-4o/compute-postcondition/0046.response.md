According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `index` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `i` should be within the range of 1 to `n`. So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `index` is 3**
