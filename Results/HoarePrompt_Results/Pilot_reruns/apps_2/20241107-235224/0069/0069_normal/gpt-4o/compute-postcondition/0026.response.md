Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one element, `b` is the first element in the list. If (x - b) is divisible by `balance` and the result of the division is non-negative, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
