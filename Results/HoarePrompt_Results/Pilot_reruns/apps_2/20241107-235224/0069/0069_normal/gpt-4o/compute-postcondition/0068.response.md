Postcondition: ***If n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will update the values in prefix_balances according to the given formula until i equals n+1. If n is less than 1, the loop will not execute. After the loop, prefix_balances will contain the updated values. If balance is 0, and x is in prefix_balances, results will contain -1, and index will be 3. If x is not in prefix_balances, results will contain 0, and index will be 3. If balance is not 0, count will be the number of elements in prefix_balances that satisfy the condition, results will contain the updated values after the loop, and index will remain at 3. If prefix_balances is empty, count, results, and index will remain unchanged.***
