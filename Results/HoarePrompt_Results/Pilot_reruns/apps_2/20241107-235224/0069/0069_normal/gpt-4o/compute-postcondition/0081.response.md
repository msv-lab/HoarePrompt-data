Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value at `data[2]`, `balance` is the result of the initial calculation based on `data[1]` and `data[2`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated with the formula `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, `i` is incremented by 1**
