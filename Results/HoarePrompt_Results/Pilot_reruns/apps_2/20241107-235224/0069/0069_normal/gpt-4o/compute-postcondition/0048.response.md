According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prefix_balances` has been updated based on the calculation formula, `results` is still an empty list, and `index` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prefix_balances` is a list with updated values, `results` is an empty list, `index` is 3, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`**
