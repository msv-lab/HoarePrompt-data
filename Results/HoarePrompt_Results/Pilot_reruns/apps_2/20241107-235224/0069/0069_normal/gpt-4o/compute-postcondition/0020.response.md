Example Answer:
The loop appends `-1` to the `results` list. The loop will execute at least once since `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop calculates the prefix sum of balances in the string `s`, the `prefix_balances` list will contain the sum of balances up to that point. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `results` contains `-1`, `prefix_balances` contains the sum of balances up to the corresponding indices.
Output State: **`results` contains `-1`, `prefix_balances` contains the sum of balances up to the corresponding indices**
