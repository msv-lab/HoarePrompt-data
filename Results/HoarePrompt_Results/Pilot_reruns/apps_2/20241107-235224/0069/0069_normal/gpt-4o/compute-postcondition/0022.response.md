Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances in the string `s`. For each index `i`, `prefix_balances[i]` is the sum of the balances from the beginning of the string up to index `i`. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, `0` is appended to `results`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes, and `prefix_balances` contains the sum of balances up to the corresponding indices. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop doesn't execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
