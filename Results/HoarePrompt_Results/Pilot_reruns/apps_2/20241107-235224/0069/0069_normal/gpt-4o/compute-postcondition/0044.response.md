According to the code, the loop will execute if n is at least 1. At the start of the loop, `index` is increased by 3, so it needs to be adjusted to `index` is 3. The list `prefix_balances` needs to have a length of at least n+1, so it should be adjusted to the list still containing zeros with length n+1. The list `results` being empty does not affect the loop execution.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `index` is 3**
