Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with at least two elements, and `b` is still the second element in the list. This holds true for all possible edge cases and scenarios of the input variables.***
