Example Answer:
The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous values of the variables are not specified, so the output state is: `n` is an integer that meets the loop condition for one more iteration, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value at `data[index + 2`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer that meets the loop condition for one more iteration, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value at `data[index + 2]`**
