Example Answer:
`floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`, where `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the value of `apartment`. The variables `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b` are not directly affected by this assignment statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, and a ≠ b; `block` is calculated using the provided formula, `floor_within_block` is based on the value of `apartment`.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, and a ≠ b; `block` is calculated using the provided formula, `floor_within_block` is based on the value of `apartment`**
