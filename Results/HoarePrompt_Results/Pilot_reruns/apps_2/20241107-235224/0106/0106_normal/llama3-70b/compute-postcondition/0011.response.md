The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns a tuple of two positive integers a and b, where a and b are distinct numbers. The values of a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to return a tuple of two distinct positive integers a and b within the specified range.
