Example Answer:
`b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`, where `b` is based on user input and `m` is a positive integer. The value of `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are based on user input, `a_floor` is between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the provided formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are based on user input, `a_floor` is between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the provided formula**
