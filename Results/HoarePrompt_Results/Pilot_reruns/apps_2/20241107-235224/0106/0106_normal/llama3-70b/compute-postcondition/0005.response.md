Example Answer: 
`b_block` is calculated using the formula provided. The value of `b` has been specified to be based on user input. Therefore, after the calculation, the value of `b_block` is determined. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are based on user input, `a_floor` is between 1 and `m`; `b_block` is calculated based on the provided formula**
