Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000**
