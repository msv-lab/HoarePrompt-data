Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are based on user input, `a_floor` is between 1 and `m`; `b_block` is calculated based on the provided formula. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is assigned the value of `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is assigned the value of `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
