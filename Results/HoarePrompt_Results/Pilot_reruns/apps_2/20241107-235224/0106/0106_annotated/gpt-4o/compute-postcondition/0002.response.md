Example Answer:
The value of `floor` is calculated by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and then adding 1. However, without knowing the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, we cannot determine the final value of `floor`. Therefore, the output state is: Cannot determine output state without the values of apartment, m, and k.
Output State: **Cannot determine output state without the values of apartment, m, and k**
