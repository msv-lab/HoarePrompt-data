Example Answer: 
The function returns the value of `total_time`, which is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Since the function only returns the value without modifying any variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **total_time is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor**
