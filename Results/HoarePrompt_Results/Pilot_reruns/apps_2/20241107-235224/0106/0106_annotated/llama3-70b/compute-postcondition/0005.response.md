Example Answer:
`b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are provided in the initial state, so based on those values, `b_block` will be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the provided values of `b`, `m`, and `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the provided values of `b`, `m`, and `k`**
