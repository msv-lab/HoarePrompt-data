Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is not specified, the values of the integers in the list `a` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input**
