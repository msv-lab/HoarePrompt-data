According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than or equal to 4. Additionally, since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 4**
