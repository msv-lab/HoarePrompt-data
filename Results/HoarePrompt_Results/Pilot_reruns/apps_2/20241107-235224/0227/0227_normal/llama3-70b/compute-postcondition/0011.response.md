Example Answer: 
`m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 4, and `m` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 4, `m` is increased by 1**
