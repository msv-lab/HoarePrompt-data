Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned as 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`. The code does not change the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1**
