Output State: **If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and any element in `assigned` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop terminates. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. The loop will not execute if the condition is met in the initial state, where `a[2] - x` exists in `assigned`.**
