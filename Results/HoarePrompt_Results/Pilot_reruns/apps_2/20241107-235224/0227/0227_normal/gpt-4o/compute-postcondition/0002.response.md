Example Answer: 
The code adds the first element of list `a` to the set `assigned`. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, the first element is `a[0]`. Therefore, after execution, the set `assigned` will contain the first element of list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`**
