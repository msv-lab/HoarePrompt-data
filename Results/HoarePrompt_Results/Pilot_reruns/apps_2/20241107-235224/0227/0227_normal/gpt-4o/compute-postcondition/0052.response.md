According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `assigned` that haven't been iterated over yet. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `m` is 3 or 4, `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, it means the loop has already iterated over the first two elements in `assigned`, so to execute one more time, `assigned` must have at least 3 elements left. 
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is 3 or 4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True if the difference between the first element in `a` and any element in `assigned` is found in `assigned`**
