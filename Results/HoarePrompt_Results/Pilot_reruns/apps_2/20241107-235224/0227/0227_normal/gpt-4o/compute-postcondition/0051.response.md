Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `m` is 3 or 4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True if the difference between the first element in `a` and any element in `assigned` is found in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
