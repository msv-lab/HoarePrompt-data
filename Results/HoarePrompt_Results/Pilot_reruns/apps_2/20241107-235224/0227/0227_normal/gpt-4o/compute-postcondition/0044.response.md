According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `assigned` is not empty. The loop will iterate over each element in `assigned`. Before the loop starts, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a` and the value added from `a[2]`. So, to ensure the loop executes, `assigned` should contain at least one element. Additionally, the value of `i` is not relevant to the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains at least one element, `m` is 3 or 4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True if the difference between the first element in `a` and any element in `assigned` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is False**
