Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the given sequence of numbers and then iterates over each number to check if it can be formed using the previously assigned numbers. If not, it increments the count of variables required. This approach covers all potential cases and provides the correct output as per the problem description.
