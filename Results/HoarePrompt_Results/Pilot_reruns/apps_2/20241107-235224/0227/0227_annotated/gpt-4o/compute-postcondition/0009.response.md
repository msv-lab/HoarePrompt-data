Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least one element from list `a`, `m` is greater than 0. If there exists an element in `a` at index `i` such that the difference between that element and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop terminates. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
