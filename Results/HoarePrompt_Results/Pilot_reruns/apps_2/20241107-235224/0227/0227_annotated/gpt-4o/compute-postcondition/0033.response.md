According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `assigned` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `i` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` to move to the next element in list `a` and update `assigned` to include the next element in list `a[i+1]`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `i` is 2**
