According to the code, the loop will execute based on the elements present in the list `assigned`. Since `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]` after adding `a[i]`, the loop will execute if `assigned` has at least 1 element.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the following modifications are needed:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]` after adding `a[i]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is False, `i` is i+2, `assigned` has at least 1 element**

This adjustment ensures that the loop will execute based on the elements present in `assigned`.
