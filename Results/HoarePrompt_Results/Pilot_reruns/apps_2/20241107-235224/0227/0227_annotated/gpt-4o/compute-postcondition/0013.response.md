Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least two elements from list `a`, `m` is greater than 0. If there exists an element `a[i]` in list `a` such that the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
