According to the code, the loop will execute for each element `x` in the list `assigned`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will break if there exists an element `a[i]` in list `a` such that the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the list `assigned`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop hasn't broken, there does not exist an element `a[i]` in list `a` such that the difference between `a[i]` and the last `x` is in the list `assigned`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, a new element `x_new` should be added to the list `assigned` that satisfies the condition mentioned above.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least three elements from list `a`, `m` is greater than 0, a new element `x_new` should be added to the list `assigned`**
