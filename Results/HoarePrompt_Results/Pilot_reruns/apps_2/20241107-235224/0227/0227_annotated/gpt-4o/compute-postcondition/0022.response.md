Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i]`, `m` is greater than the previous value. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1 and `can_form` is set to True if the difference between an element in `a` and `x` exists in `assigned`.**
