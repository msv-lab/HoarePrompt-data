Example Answer: 
The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The variables `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, and `x_new` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least three elements from list `a`, `m` is greater than 0, a new element `x_new` should be added to the list `assigned`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least three elements from list `a`, `m` is greater than 0, a new element `x_new` should be added to the list `assigned`**
