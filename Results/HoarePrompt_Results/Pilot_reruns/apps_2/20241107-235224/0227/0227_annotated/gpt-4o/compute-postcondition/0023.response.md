According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i]`, `m` is greater than the previous value. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1 and `can_form` is set to True if the difference between an element in `a` and `x` exists in `assigned`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `n` remains the same as it does not affect the loop execution.
- Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next iteration: `i` becomes i + 1.
- Include the newly added element `a[i]` in `assigned`.
- `m` should be greater than the previous value, so increment `m` by 1.
- If `can_form` is False, set it to True if the difference between an element in `a` and `x` exists in `assigned`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` and the newly added element `a[i+1]`, `m` is greater than the previous value, `can_form` is True or False based on the conditions mentioned above, `i` is i + 1**
