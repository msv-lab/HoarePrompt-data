Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element. `assigned` contains elements from list `a` including the newly added element `a[i+2]`. `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`. `can_form` is True. `i` is i+3. `assigned` has at least 2 elements. The program breaks out of the loop or if statement if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`.***
