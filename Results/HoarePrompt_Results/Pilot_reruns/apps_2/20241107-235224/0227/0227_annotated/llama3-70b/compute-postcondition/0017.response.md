Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list in ascending order and then iterates through the list to count the number of times a number is not double the previous number. It prints the count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value.**
