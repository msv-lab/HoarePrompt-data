Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the input values after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input values are distinct positive integers, so the list `a` will contain these values. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in the list `a`**
