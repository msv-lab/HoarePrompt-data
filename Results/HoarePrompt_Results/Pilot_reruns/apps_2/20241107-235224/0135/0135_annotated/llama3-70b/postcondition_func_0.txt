The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainders repeat. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not actually calculate n^k as stated in the annotations.
