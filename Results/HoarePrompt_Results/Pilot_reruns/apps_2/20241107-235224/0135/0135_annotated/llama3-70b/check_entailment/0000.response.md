Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description by checking if all the remainders of division of n by integers i from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the seen remainders and exits with 'No' if a duplicate remainder is found. If all remainders are distinct, it prints 'Yes'. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations provided also align with the logic of the code.
