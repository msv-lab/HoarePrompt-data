According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen remainders including the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen remainders including the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 0**
