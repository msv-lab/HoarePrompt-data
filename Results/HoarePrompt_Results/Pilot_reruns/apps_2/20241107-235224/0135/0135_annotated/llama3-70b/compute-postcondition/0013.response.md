Example Answer:
The `remainder` is added to the `seen` set. If the `remainder` is already in the `seen` set, 'No' is printed and the program exits. The previous values of the variables are known, so the `remainder` is added to the `seen` set. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen remainders including the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `remainder` is added to the `seen` set.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen remainders including the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `remainder` is added to the `seen` set**
