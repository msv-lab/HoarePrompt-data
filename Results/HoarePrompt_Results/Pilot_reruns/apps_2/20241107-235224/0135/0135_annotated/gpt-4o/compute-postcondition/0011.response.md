According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`.
State: **`n` and `k + 1` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k + 1` ≤ 10^18, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`**
