Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. The initial values are `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. After execution, `remainder` will be the remainder of `n` divided by 1, which will always be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
