According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is the set containing only `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, as it should be less than or equal to `k`. No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is the set containing only `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
