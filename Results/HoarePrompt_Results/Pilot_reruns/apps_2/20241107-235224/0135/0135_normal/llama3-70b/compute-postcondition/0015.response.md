Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are input integers and `i` is 2. Therefore, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2. The initial value of `remainder` is 0. 
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is the set containing only `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
