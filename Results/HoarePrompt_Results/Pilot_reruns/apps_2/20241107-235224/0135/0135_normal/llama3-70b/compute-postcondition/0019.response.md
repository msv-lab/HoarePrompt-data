Example Answer:
The code adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. Since `seen` initially contains only `remainder`, there is no change in the set. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is the set containing only `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is the set containing only `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
