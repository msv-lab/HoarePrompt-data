The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input. It then iterates from 1 to `k` inclusive, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If a remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' at the end. The function does not actually calculate the result of `n^k` as mentioned in the annotations. It checks for repeated remainders during the iteration and outputs 'Yes' if no repetitions are found.
