Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is at least 1. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, `seen_remainders` will contain unique remainders calculated as n % i after each iteration.** 

If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and the initial state will remain unchanged.
