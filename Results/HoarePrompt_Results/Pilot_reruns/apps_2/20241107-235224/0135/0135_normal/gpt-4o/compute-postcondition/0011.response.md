According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `remainder` is calculated as n % 3. Since `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute one more time with `i` incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 4, `remainder` is calculated as n % 3**
