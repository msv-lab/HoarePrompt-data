Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No'. Then, it iterates through integers from 1 to k, calculating remainders of n divided by each integer. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. If no remainders are repeated, the function returns 'Yes'. This logic aligns with the problem statement, ensuring that all remainders are distinct. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem description and the output hints confirm the correct functionality of the code.
