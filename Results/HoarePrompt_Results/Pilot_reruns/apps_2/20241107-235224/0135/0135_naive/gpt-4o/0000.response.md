Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders modulo 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns "No" if a remainder is seen again, indicating that the remainders are not distinct. Otherwise, it returns "Yes". The logic and implementation align with the problem description.
