Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the voting process according to the problem description. It maintains two queues, one for each faction, and iterates through the votes to determine which employee denies the voting right to another. The process continues until only one faction has a remaining voter. The program correctly outputs 'D' if depublicans win and 'R' if remocrats win. The code covers all possible scenarios and follows the rules of the voting procedure described in the problem statement.
