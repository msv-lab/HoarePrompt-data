Postcondition: ***If `depublicans` are greater than `remocrats`, the program prints 'D'. If `remocrats` are equal to or greater than `depublicans`, the program prints 'R'. In all cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` has been iterated through. If a fraction is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by the number of occurrences of 'D'. If a fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by the number of occurrences of non-'D' fractions. If the loop does not execute, `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0.***
