Example Answer: 
`depublicans` is assigned the value 0. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is assigned the user input value, `depublicans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is assigned the user input value, `depublicans` is 0**
