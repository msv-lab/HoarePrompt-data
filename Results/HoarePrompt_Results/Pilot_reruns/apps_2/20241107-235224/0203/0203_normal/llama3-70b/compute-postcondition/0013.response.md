Example Answer:
The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, so after execution, `depublicans` will have an increased value. The count of `remocrats` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` has at least one more element, the count of `depublicans` is updated based on the last fraction processed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` has at least one more element, count of `depublicans` is updated based on the last fraction processed**
