Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `votes` is the original string, `d_queue` and `r_queue` lists will be updated based on the presence of 'D' and 'R' characters in `votes`. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be updated accordingly. If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty, the loop will terminate. If there are no 'D' characters in `votes`, `d_queue` will remain empty. If there are no 'R' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` will remain empty.**
