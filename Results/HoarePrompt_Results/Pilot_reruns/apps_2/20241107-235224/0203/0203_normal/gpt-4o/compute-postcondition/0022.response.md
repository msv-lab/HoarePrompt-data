Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_index` contains the value removed from `r_queue` at index 0. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`***
