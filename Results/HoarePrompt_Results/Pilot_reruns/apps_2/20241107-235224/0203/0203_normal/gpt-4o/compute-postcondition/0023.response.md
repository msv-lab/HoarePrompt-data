According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the key variables are `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `d_index`, `r_index`, and `n`. 

1. Since the loop can execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` must have values in them.
2. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`. So, the values of `d_index` and `r_index` need to be adjusted accordingly based on this condition.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` and `r_index` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above.**
