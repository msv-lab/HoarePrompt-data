Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. The value of `d_queue` is modified by removing the first element. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` is adjusted based on the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` remains the same**
