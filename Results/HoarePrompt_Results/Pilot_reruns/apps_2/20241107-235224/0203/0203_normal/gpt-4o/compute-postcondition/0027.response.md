Example Answer:
`r_queue` appends `r_index + n` where `n` is the input integer. The previous values of `r_queue` are unchanged, `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `r_index` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` is adjusted based on the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is updated with the popped value from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` is adjusted based on the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is updated with the popped value from `r_queue`**
