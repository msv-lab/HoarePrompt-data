Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `votes` is a string. The state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` lists will depend on the presence of 'D' and 'R' characters in `votes`. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be updated based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and new values will be appended to the respective queues if the conditions are met. If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty, the loop will terminate. If there are no 'D' characters in `votes`, `d_queue` will remain empty. If there are no 'R' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` will remain empty. After the execution of the if else block, the program state will reflect the modifications made to `d_queue` and `r_queue` based on the input `votes`, and the respective indexes `d_index` and `r_index` will be updated accordingly.***
