Example Answer:
`i` is appended to `d_queue`, and `d_queue` had 0 initially. Therefore, after execution, `d_queue` contains [0, 1]. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains [0, 1], `r_queue` contains 0, `i` is 1, and `v` is the second character in the `votes` string**
