Example Answer:
`r_index` is added to `n` and appended to `r_queue`. The previous values of `r_queue` and `r_index` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`, and a new value calculated from the addition is appended to `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`, and a new value calculated from the addition is appended to `r_queue`**
