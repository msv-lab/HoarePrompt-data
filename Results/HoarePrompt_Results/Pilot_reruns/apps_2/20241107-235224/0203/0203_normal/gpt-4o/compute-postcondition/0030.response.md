Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. The previous states of `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `r_index`, and `votes` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`**
