Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `r_queue`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n containing only characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n containing only characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list**
