Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the described voting process where employees take turns in denying others the right to vote until only one employee is left. The code categorizes the employees into 'D' and 'R' queues based on their fractions and then iterates through the queues, moving indices and appending new values until one of the queues becomes empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, or 'R' if the 'R' queue is not empty. The code covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
