Example Answer: 
`d_index` is added to `n` and stored in `d_queue`. The length of `votes` is unknown but at least one character. `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` has values including d_index + n, `r_queue` has values, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` has values including d_index + n, `r_queue` has values, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`**
