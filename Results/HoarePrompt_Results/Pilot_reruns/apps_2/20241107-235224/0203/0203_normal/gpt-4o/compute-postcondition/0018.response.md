Example Answer: 
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. The value of `d_queue` depends on the presence of 'D' characters in the `votes` string. If there are 'D' characters, `d_queue` will have at least one index value, and `d_index` will be assigned that value. If there are no 'D' characters, `d_queue` will be empty, and trying to pop from an empty list will result in an error. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`**
