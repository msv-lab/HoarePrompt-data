Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, after the execution of the if-else block, `depublicans` will contain the count of 'D's in the `fractions` list, `remocrats` will remain 0, and either 'D' or 'R' will be printed based on whether `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `depublicans` and `remocrats` will both be 0, and 'R' will always be printed as `depublicans` will not be greater than `remocrats`.***
