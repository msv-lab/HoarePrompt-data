Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and iterate through each character in the `fractions` list. If the character is 'D', `depublicans` will increase by the number of 'D's encountered; otherwise, `remocrats` will increase by the number of 'R's encountered. The final state will be that `depublicans` contains the count of 'D's and `remocrats` contains the count of 'R's in the `fractions` list. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute, and `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain 0.**
