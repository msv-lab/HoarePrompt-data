Example Answer: 
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state states that `depublicans` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, after execution, `depublicans` will be 1. The states of `remocrats` and `n` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains at least 1 character, each being either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0**
