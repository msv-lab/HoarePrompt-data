Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is appended to the list `r_queue`. The previous values of `n` and `votes` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, votes is a string consisting of (n+1) characters, i is n, v is the (n+1)th character in the string, and `r_queue` contains the value of `i`.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, votes is a string consisting of (n+1) characters, i is n, v is the (n+1)th character in the string, `r_queue` contains the value of `i`**
