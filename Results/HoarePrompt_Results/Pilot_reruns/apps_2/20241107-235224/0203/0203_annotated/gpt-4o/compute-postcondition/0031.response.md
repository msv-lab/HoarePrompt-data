Example Answer:
The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `r_queue`. The previous values of `r_queue` and `r_index` are unknown, so the output state is: r_queue is updated after removing the first element, r_index is assigned the popped value.
Output State: **r_queue is updated after removing the first element, r_index is assigned the popped value**
