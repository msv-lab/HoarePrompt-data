Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, votes is a string consisting of (n+1) characters, i is n, v is the (n+1)th character in the string. If v is 'D', the value of i is appended to the d_queue. If v is not 'D', the value of i is appended to the r_queue. Both d_queue and r_queue will contain values based on the conditions specified, ensuring the integrity of the queues after the execution of the if-else block.***
