Example Answer: 
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. The specific values of `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `d_index`, `r_index`, and `n` are not provided, so the output state is: the specific values of d_queue, r_queue, d_index, r_index, and n need to be updated to satisfy the conditions mentioned above for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **the specific values of d_queue, r_queue, d_index, r_index, and n need to be updated to satisfy the conditions mentioned above for the next iteration of the loop.**
