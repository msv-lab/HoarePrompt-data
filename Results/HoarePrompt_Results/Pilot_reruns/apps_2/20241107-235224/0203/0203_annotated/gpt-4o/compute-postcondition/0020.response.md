Example Answer:
d_queue is appended with d_index + n. The previous values of d_queue, d_index, and n are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will be empty. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. d_queue is appended with d_index + n.
Output State: **After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty.
