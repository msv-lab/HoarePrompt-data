Example Answer:
r_index is incremented by n and the result is appended to r_queue. The previous values of r_index and r_queue are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will contain the incremented value of r_index + n. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character.
Output State: **After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will contain the incremented value of r_index + n. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character.**
