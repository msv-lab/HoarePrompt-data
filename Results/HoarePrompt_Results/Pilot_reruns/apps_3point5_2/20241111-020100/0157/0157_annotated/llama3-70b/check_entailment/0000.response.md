Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the ratios provided in the problem description and then calculates the total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used. The annotations also align with the code logic and do not suggest any cases where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
