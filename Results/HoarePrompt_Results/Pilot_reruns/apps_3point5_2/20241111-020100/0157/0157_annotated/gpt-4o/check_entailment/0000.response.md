Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the ratios given in the problem and then calculates the total number of fruits that can be obtained. The output matches the expected output as described in the problem statement. The annotations also accurately describe the purpose of the code and the variables used in the calculations. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not behave as expected.
