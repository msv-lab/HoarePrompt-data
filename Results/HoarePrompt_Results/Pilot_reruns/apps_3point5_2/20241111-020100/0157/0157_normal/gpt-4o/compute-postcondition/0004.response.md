Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, `total_fruits` is calculated as the sum of `max_lemons * 1`, `max_lemons * 2`, and `max_lemons * 4`. The output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the total of the calculated fruits based on `max_lemons`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the total of the calculated fruits based on `max_lemons`**
