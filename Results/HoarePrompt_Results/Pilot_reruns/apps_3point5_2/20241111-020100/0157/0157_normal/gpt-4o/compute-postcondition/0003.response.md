Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The division operator `//` returns the integer division. Based on the initial state provided where `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, the value of `max_lemons` will be the minimum of the three calculated values. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
