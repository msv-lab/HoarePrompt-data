Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `total_fruits`. `total_fruits` is calculated as the total of the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The previous states of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the total of the calculated fruits based on `max_lemons`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the total of the calculated fruits based on `max_lemons`**
