Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value between `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` is calculated. Finally, the result of this expression is printed. The output state is: `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the printed result is based on the calculation using the minimum value between `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the result of the expression is printed**
