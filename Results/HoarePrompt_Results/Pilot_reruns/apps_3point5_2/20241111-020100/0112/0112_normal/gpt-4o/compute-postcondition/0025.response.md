According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If there are more digits left in the list, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is initialized as `False`, and the values of `used_cubes[i]` are updated based on the loop conditions, but the state of `digits` is not provided. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state of `digits` to have at least one more digit in the list.
State: **`found` is initialized as `False`, and the values of `used_cubes[i]` are updated based on the loop conditions, `digits` has at least one more digit in the list**
