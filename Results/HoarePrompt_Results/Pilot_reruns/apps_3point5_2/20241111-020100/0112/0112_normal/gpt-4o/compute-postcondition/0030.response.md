The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num`, a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 3, and a list of n lists `cube_faces` where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube. 

In Case 1, if at least one cube face with the corresponding digit is available, the function will set used_cubes[i] to True for that cube face. If no cube face with the corresponding digit is available, the function will return False. If the list of digits is empty or n is 0, the loop will not execute and used_cubes will remain unchanged. If num has more digits than the length of the digits list, the loop will iterate over the available digits.

In Case 2, the functionality is the same as in Case 1, with the same conditions and outcomes.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `num`, a positive integer `n` between 1 and 3, and a list of n lists `cube_faces` representing the faces of cubes. The function iterates over the available digits of num and checks if there is a cube face with the corresponding digit. If at least one cube face with the corresponding digit is available, it marks the used_cubes list accordingly. If not, it returns False.
