The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has for her birthday. `cubes` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on each face of the cube. The function then iterates over integers starting from 0 until it finds the smallest integer x such that `can_form_number(x)` is False. If such an integer exists, the function returns that value. If no such integer is found, the function returns 0.
