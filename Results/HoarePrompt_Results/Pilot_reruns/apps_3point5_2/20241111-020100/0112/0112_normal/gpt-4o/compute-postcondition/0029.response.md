Output State: **If at least one cube face with the corresponding digit is available, used_cubes[i] will be True for that cube face. If not, the loop will return False. If digits is empty or n is 0, the loop does not execute and used_cubes remains unchanged. If num has more digits than the length of digits list, the loop will still iterate over the available digits.**
