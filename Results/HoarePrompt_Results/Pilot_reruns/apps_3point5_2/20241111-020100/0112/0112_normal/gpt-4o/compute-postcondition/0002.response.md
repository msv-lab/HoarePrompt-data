According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are digits in the `digits` list to iterate over. Given that `digits` contains the individual digits of `num` as strings, the loop will execute as long as there are digits in `num`. Since `num` is a positive integer, it must have at least one digit for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, so we need to set `used_cubes` to have n elements, all with a value of `False` to ensure the loop can execute. Additionally, for the loop to execute, `num` must have at least one digit and `n` must be between 1 and 3.
State: **`num` is a positive integer with at least one digit, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values**
