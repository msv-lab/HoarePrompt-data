Functionality: The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num`, a positive integer `n` between 1 and 3, and a list of n lists `cube_faces` representing the faces of cubes. It iterates over the individual digits of `num` and checks if there is a cube face that contains the corresponding digit. If at least one cube face with the corresponding digit is found, it marks the `used_cubes` list accordingly. If no cube face with the corresponding digit is available, the function returns False. If the list of digits is empty or `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If `num` has more digits than the length of the `digits` list, the loop will still iterate over the available digits.
