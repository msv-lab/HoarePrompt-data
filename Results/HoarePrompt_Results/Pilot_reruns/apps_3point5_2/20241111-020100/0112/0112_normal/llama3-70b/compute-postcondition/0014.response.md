Example Answer:
The code snippet does not directly affect any variables in the initial state. It simply prints out the value of `max_num`. Since `max_num` is not defined in the initial state, it would result in an error. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the sublists of cubes with '0' removed**
