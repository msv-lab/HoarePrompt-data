Example Answer: 
For each `cube` in the first sublist of `cubes`, the string representation of `digit` is added to the `digits` set using `update`. Since `digits` initially contains the string representations of integers from the first sublist of `cubes`, the new string representations are added to `digits`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` contains 2 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, and `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes along with the new string representations.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 2 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes along with the new string representations**
