Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input for `n` and then creates a list of `n` sublists where each sublist contains integers obtained from splitting the input. Since `n` is an input integer ranging from 1 to 3, the list `cubes` will have 1 to 3 sublists containing integers obtained from input. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input**
