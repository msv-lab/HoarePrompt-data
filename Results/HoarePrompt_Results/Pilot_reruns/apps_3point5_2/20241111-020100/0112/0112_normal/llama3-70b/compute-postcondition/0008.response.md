Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the string representations of integers in the first sublist of `cubes` along with new string representations. Since `cubes` contains at least 4 sublists, and `digits` initially contains the string representations of integers in the first sublist of `cubes`, the set `digits` will be updated with additional string representations from the first sublist of `cubes` and the new string representations generated from the integers in that sublist. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains at least 4 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes along with new string representations**
