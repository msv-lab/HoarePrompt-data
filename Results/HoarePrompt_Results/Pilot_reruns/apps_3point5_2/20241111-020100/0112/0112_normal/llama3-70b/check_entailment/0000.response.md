Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints correctly summarize the code functionality. However, the code does not handle the restriction that Masha cannot make the digit 6 from the digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may generate incorrect maximum numbers in certain cases.
