According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If the cubes list has at least 5 sublists, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains at least 4 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes along with new string representations. 

To execute the loop one more time, the cubes list must contain at least 5 sublists. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of sublists in cubes.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains at least 5 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes along with new string representations**
