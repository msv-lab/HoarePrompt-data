According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If there are more sublists in cubes, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to make sure that there are more sublists in the cubes list. Therefore, we need to adjust the number of sublists in cubes to be greater than the current number of sublists. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 2 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes**
