Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the sublists of cubes. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. The program retains the initial conditions stated in the precondition, with the exception that if '0' was present in `digits`, it has been removed.***
