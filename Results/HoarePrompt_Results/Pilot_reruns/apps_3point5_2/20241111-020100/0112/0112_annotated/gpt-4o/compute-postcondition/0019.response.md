According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: *After executing the if statement, `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `cube_faces` is a list of length n where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of single-character strings representing each digit in `num` with at least 1 digit. The `i-th` element in `used_cubes` is set to `True` if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is true, `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and a break statement is executed. `i` should be incremented to 3.
