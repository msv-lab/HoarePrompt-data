According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, and `found` have specific values as described. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After executing the if statement, `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `cube_faces` is a list of length n where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of single-character strings representing each digit in `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is set to `True` if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first digit in the list, and `found` is `True` after successfully finding the digit in the cube_faces list and breaking out of the loop, `i` is 1**
