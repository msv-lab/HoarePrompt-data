According to the code, the loop will execute for each digit in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `num` should be a positive integer greater than 0.
- There should be at least 1 digit in the `digits` list.
- If the digit is found in a cube face that has not been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to `True`, and `found` is set to `True`.
- The loop will continue this process for each cube until the digit is found or all cubes have been checked.
- If the digit is not found in any cube, `found` should remain `False`.

State: **If `num` is a positive integer greater than 0 and there is at least 1 digit in `digits`, the loop searches for the first digit in the `cube_faces` of each cube. If the digit is found in a cube face that has not been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to `True`, and `found` is set to `True`. The loop continues this process for each cube until the digit is found or all cubes have been checked. If the digit is not found in any cube, `found` remains `False`.**
