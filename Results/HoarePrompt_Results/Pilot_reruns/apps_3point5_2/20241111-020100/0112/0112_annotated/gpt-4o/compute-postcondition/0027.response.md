According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more digits left in the `digits` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, and there are more digits left in `digits` to iterate over. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`found` is False, there are more digits left in `digits` to iterate over**
