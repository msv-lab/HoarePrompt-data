Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the annotations, it appears that the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes to form all integers from 1 to x. The `can_form_number` function checks if a given number can be formed using the numbers on the faces of the cubes without violating the rules mentioned in the problem description.

The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at different stages and explain the behavior of the functions accurately. The code implements the logic required to determine the maximum number that Masha can form using her cubes, taking into account the restrictions mentioned in the problem statement.

Since the code covers all possible cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
