According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 to satisfy the condition that `i` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After executing the if statement, `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `cube_faces` is a list of length n where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of single-character strings representing each digit in `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is set to `True` if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is `True` after successfully finding the digit in the `cube_faces` list and breaking out of the loop, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True` when `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
