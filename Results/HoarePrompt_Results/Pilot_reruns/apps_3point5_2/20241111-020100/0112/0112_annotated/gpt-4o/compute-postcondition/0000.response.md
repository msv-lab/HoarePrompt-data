Example Answer: 
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of single-character strings representing each digit in the number `num`. Since `num` is a positive integer, `digits` will be a list of strings where each string represents a single digit of the number. 
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of length n where each element is a list of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of single-character strings representing each digit in `num`**
