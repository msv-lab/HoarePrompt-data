You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.

At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.

To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.

The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.

Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.


-----Input-----

In first line integer n is given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.

Each of next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) — number on j-th face of i-th cube.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximum number x such Masha can make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
87
Input
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

Output
98


-----Note-----

In the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    #State of the program here: n is an input integer representing the number of cubes Masha has received for her birthday
    cubes = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    #State of the program here: `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input, with the number of inner lists equal to the input integer `n`
    digits = set()
    #State of the program here: `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input, with the number of inner lists equal to the input integer `n`; `digits` is an empty set
    for cube in cubes:
        digits.update(str(digit) for digit in cube)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and `digits` will contain unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute and `digits` will remain an empty set.
    if ('0' in digits) :
        digits.remove('0')
        #State of the program here: If `n` is greater than 0, the set `digits` contains unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If `n` is 0, the set `digits` remains empty.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: If `n` is greater than 0, the set `digits` contains unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If `n` is 0, the set `digits` remains empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If n is greater than 0, the set `digits` contains unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If n is 0, the set `digits` remains empty. Additionally, if '0' is in the set `digits`, it is removed.
    max_num = int(''.join(sorted(digits, reverse=True)))
    #State of the program here: If n is greater than 0, the set `digits` contains unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If n is 0, the set `digits` remains empty. Additionally, if '0' is in the set `digits`, it is removed. `max_num` is the integer value of the sorted digits in descending order.
    print(max_num)
    #State of the program here: If n is greater than 0, the set `digits` contains unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If n is 0, the set `digits` remains empty. Additionally, if '0' is in the set `digits`, it is removed. `max_num` is the integer value of the sorted digits in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of cubes Masha received for her birthday. Then, it reads `n` lists of integers representing cubes. It extracts unique digits from all the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and converts them into an integer `max_num`. Finally, it prints `max_num`. If the input `n` is 0 or negative, the function will not perform any operations.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
