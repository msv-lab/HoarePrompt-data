Example Answer: 
The code removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. If `n` is greater than 0, the set `digits` will contain unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If `n` is 0, the set `digits` will remain empty. The removal of '0' does not affect the state of `n`. 
Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the set `digits` contains unique individual digits as strings from all the cubes. If `n` is 0, the set `digits` remains empty.**
