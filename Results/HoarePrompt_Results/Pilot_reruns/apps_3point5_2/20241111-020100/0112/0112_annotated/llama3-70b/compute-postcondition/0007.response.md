According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `cubes`. If there is at least one more list of integers obtained from input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least one more list of integers obtained from input, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` needs to have at least one more list of integers obtained from input. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cubes` has at least two lists of integers obtained from input, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings**
