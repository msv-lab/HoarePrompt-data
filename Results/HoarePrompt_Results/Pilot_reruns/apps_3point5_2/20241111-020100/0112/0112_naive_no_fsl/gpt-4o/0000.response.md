2. The `can_form_number` function correctly checks if a number can be formed using the given cubes.
3. The program iterates to find the maximum number x that can be formed using the cubes as described in the problem statement.
4. The program logic follows the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases provided.
5. The program uses sets to store the faces of the cubes, ensuring that each digit can only be used once per cube.
