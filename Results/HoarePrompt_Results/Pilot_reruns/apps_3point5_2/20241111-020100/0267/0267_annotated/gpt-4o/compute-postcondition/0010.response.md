According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `num` being less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer initialized to 0. If the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is the next integer after the current `num` and is still less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is an integer less than or equal to `r`. There are no changes to the initial conditions if the condition is false. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next integer `num` after the current `num` must still be less than or equal to `r`. If `func_1(num, k)` is true, then `total_sum` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`total_sum` is an integer that may have been updated based on the condition `func_1(num, k)`, where `num` is the next integer after the current `num` and is still less than or equal to `r`.**
