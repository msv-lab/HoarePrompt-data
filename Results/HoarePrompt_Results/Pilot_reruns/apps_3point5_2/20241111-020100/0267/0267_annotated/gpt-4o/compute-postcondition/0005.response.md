Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the current value of `num` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. The value of `num` is updated to the next integer after the current `num`. The states of `total_sum` and `num` are affected, while `l` and `r` remain the same. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated with the new value, `num` is updated, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
