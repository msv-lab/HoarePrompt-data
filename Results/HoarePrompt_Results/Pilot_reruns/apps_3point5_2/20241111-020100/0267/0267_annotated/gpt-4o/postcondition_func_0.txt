The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer. It then converts n to a string, creates a set of unique characters in the string, and checks if the length of the set is less than or equal to k. The function returns True if the condition is met, indicating that the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k.
