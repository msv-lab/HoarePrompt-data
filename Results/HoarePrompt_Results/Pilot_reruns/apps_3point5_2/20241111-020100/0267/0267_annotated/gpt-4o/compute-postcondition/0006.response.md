Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is an integer, initialized to 0. `num` is an integer updated to the next integer after the current `num`, and is still less than or equal to `r`. `l` is an integer less than or equal to `r`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to True, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of the current `total_sum` and `num`, modulo MOD. The updated `num` is still less than or equal to `r` and `l` remains less than or equal to `r`. No changes occur if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to False.***
