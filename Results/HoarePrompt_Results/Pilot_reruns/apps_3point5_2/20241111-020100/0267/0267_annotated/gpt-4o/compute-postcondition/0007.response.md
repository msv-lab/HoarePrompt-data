According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer initialized to 0, `num` is updated to the next integer after the current `num` and is still less than or equal to `r`, `l` is an integer less than or equal to `r`. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer after the current `num`, `num` should still be less than or equal to `r`, and `l` should remain less than or equal to `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer initialized to 0, `num` is the next integer after the current `num` and is still less than or equal to `r`, `l` is an integer less than or equal to `r`**
