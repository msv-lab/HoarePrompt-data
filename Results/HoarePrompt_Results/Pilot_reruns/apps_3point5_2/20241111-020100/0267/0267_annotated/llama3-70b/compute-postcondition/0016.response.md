Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in dp, the function returns the value stored for that key. If n < 10 ** k, dp[n, k] is updated to n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated based on the provided formula, where the value is calculated and the result is stored in dp with the modulus operation applied with MOD. This covers all possible cases and edge scenarios for the program variables after the if else block execution.***
