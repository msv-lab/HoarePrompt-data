Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the calculation `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n` and `k` are non-negative integers, but their specific values are not provided. After the calculation, the state of `dp[n, k]` is updated. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the current value + 2, and `dp[n, k]` is updated after the calculation**
