According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k-1`. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `dp` is a dictionary storing previously calculated values.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary storing previously calculated values**
