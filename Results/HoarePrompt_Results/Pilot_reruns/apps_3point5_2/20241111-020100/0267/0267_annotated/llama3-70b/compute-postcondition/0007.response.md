Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n,k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n` and `k` are known, but the value of `i` is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated according to the given formula.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated according to the given formula**
