Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The `func_1` function utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the count of numbers satisfying the given condition within a given range. The `count` function correctly counts the numbers and computes the sum modulo $998244353$. The program handles all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct, resulting in the expected output for all valid inputs.
