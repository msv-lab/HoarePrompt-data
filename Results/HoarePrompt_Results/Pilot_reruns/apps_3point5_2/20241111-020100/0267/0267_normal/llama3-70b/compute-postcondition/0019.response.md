Functionality: **The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `dp` (a dictionary to store computed values). The function first checks if `k` equals 0 and returns 0 without any changes to the parameters. Then, it looks up the value in the dictionary `dp` at key `(n, k)` and returns it if present, otherwise returning 0. Finally, the function calculates and stores values in `dp` based on certain conditions and returns the value stored at key `(n, k)`. The functionality of the function involves handling specific cases based on the parameters provided.**
