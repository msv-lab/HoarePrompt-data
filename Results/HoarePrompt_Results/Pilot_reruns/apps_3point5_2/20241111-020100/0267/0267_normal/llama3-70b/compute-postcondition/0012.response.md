According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `k` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary with updated values based on the formula provided, `i` is 4**
