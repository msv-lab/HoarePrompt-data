According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer does not play a role in determining whether the loop will execute. The important conditions are `i` and `k`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to 1, since the loop starts at 1, and `k` should be a positive integer.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values with dp[n, k] = 9, `i` is 1**
