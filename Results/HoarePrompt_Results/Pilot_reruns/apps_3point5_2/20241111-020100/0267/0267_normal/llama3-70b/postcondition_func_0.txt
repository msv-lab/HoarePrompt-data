The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, subject to the constraints 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and then calculates the result of `(count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD` and returns it. The function seems to rely on a `count` function that is not defined within the provided code. Therefore, the functionality of the `func_1` function is to perform a computation based on the `count` function with given parameters and return the result.
