Output State: **If `r` is less than `l`, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, for each `num` in the range from `l` to `r`, if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. After the loop executes, `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` are all integers, and the function returns `total_sum`.**
