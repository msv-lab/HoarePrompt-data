The function `func_2` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates through the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. For each `num` in this range, if the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true, it updates the `total_sum` by adding `num` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If `r` is less than `l`, the loop does not execute. After the loop execution, the function returns the final value of `total_sum`. The function ensures that `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` are all integers. It follows the provided preconditions strictly.
