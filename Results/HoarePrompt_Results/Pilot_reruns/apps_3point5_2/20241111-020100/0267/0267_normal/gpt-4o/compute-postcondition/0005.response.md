Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo of `MOD`. The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated according to the formula `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is incremented by 1, `l` and `r` maintain their initial values.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the formula `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is incremented by 1, `l` and `r` maintain their initial values**
