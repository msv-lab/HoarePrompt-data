Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the formula `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is incremented by 1, `l` and `r` maintain their initial values**
