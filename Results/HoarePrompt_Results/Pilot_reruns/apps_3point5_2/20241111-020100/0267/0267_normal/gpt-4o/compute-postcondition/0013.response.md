The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The preconditions state that `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.

If `r` is less than `l`, the loop inside the function does not execute. Otherwise, for each `num` in the range from `l` to `r`, if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, the `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` are all integers. After the loop executes, the function returns `total_sum`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k` under the specified preconditions, iterate through the range from `l` to `r`, update `total_sum` based on the result of `func_1(num, k)`, and finally return the updated `total_sum`.
