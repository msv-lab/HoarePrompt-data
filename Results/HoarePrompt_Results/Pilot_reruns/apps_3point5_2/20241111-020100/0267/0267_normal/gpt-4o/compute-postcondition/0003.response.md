Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, where `l` is a valid starting point and `num` equals `l`. Otherwise, `total_sum` remains unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` maintain their initial values, and `num` is equal to `l`.***
