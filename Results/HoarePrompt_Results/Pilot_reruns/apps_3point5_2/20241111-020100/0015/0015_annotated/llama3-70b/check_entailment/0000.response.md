Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads three integers a, b, and c from the input.
2. It then checks two conditions:
   - If c is 0 and a is equal to b, it prints 'YES'. If c is 0 and a is not equal to b, it prints 'NO'.
   - If c is not 0, it checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the division result is non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
3. The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement, including the cases when c is 0 and when (b - a) is not divisible by c.

The annotations provide a clear explanation of the logic behind the code and how it handles different scenarios. By comparing the annotations with the problem description, it is evident that the code aligns with the requirements specified in the problem statement.
