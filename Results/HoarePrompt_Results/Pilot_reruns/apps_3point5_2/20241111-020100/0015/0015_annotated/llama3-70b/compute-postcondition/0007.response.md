Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers obtained from input split. If c is 0 and a is equal to b, then 'YES' is printed. If c is 0 and a is not equal to b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not 0 and (b - a) is divisible by c and the division result is non-negative, then 'YES' is printed. If c is not 0 and either (b - a) is not divisible by c or the division result is negative, then 'NO' is printed. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if-else block.***
