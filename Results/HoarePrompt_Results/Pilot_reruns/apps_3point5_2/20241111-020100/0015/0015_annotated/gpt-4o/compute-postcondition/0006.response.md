Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received. If `c` equals 0, the program prints 'NO'. In the case where the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are modified according to the input in both branches of the if-else statement. This comprehensive postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring a clear understanding of the program's final state after execution.***
