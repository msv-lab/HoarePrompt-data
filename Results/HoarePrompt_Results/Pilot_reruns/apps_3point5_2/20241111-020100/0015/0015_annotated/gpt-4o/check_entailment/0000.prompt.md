You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya likes everything infinite. Now he is studying the properties of a sequence s, such that its first element is equal to a (s_1 = a), and the difference between any two neighbouring elements is equal to c (s_{i} - s_{i} - 1 = c). In particular, Vasya wonders if his favourite integer b appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer i, such that s_{i} = b. Of course, you are the person he asks for a help.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contain three integers a, b and c ( - 10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) — the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number and the difference between any two neighbouring elements of the sequence, respectively.


-----Output-----

If b appears in the sequence s print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7 3

Output
YES

Input
10 10 0

Output
YES

Input
1 -4 5

Output
NO

Input
0 60 50

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the sequence starts from integers 1, 4, 7, so 7 is its element.

In the second sample, the favorite integer of Vasya is equal to the first element of the sequence.

In the third sample all elements of the sequence are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.

In the fourth sample, the sequence starts from 0, 50, 100, and all the following elements are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    #State of the program here: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received
    if (b == a) :
        print('YES')
        #State of the program here: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received.
    else :
        if (c == 0) :
            print('NO')
            #State of the program here: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received
        #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received
        else :
            if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) :
                print('YES')
                #State of the program here: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received
            #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received
            else :
                print('NO')
                #State of the program here: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received
            #State of the program after the else part has been executed: `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 holds true, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are altered based on the input received in both the if and else blocks, ensuring that the program output is determined by the given conditions.
        #State of the program after the else part has been executed: *`a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 holds true, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are altered based on the input received in both the if and else blocks, ensuring that the program output is determined by the given conditions.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input received. If `c` equals 0, the program prints 'NO'. In the case where the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are modified according to the input in both branches of the if-else statement. This comprehensive postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring a clear understanding of the program's final state after execution.

The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, providing a comprehensive overview of the final state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function does not accept any parameters. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input and then performs conditional checks on these values. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'. If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` holds true, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs the result of these conditional checks based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` that were read from input. The postcondition indicates that the function does not accept parameters, which contradicts the provided annotated code. The actual functionality relies on input values and conditional checks to determine the printed output.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
