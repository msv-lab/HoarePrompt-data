Functionality: ** The function takes three input integers a, b, and c and based on certain conditions, it prints 'YES' if b equals a, 'NO' if c is 0, 'YES' if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, and 'NO' otherwise. The function accurately handles different scenarios for the input values of a, b, and c, ensuring appropriate output based on the conditions. **
