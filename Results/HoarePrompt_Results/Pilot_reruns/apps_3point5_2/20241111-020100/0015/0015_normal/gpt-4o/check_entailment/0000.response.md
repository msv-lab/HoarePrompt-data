Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three input integers a, b, and c, and based on certain conditions, it prints 'YES' if b equals a, 'NO' if c is 0, 'YES' if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, and 'NO' otherwise. The code accurately handles different scenarios for the input values of a, b, and c, ensuring the appropriate output based on the conditions. Each condition specified in the problem description is met by the code, making it correct for all potential cases.
