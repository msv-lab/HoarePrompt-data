Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If (b - a) % c is equal to 0 and (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This postcondition ensures that the program covers all possible scenarios for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, including edge cases, and accurately reflects the program's behavior.***
