Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly checks if Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence based on the given conditions. It handles the case where the favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, as well as when the difference between the favorite number and the first element is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements and the result is non-negative. The program also correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is 0, in which case Vasya's favorite number must be the first element of the sequence. The logic covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
