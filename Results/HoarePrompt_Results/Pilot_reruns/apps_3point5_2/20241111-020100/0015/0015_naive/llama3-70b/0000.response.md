Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If the difference between a and b is divisible by c, and the result is a non-negative number, then b can be reached in the sequence starting from a with a constant difference of c. This is correctly checked in the program.
2. If c is zero, then b can only be in the sequence if a is equal to b, which is also correctly handled in the program.
3. The program accounts for all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, making it correct for all cases.
