According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, `target`, `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 4. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` needs to be increased by 4.
2. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, `j` needs to be increased by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 8, `j` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`**
