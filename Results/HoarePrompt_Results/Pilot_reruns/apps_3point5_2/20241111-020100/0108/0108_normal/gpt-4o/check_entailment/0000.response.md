Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a string `s` and compares it with the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to check if `s` contains all the characters of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the same order.
- It iterates through both strings simultaneously and advances the pointer in the target string only if the character in `s` matches the character in the target string.
- If at the end of the iteration, the pointer in the target string has reached the end, it means that `s` contains all the characters of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the correct order and the code prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- If the pointer does not reach the end, it means that `s` does not contain all the characters in the correct order and the code prints -1.
- The code handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' from the given input string by returning -1.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case and correctly determines if it is possible to obtain the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' as a subsequence of the input string.
