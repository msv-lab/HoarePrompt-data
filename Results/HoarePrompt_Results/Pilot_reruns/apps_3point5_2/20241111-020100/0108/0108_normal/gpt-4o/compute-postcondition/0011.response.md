According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target` (which is 26), the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 3, `j` can be either 0 or 1 based on the comparison of `s[i+1]` with `target[j]`, and if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` should be increased by 3 further.
2. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` should be increased by 1.
3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is further increased by 3, `j` may be increased based on the conditions mentioned above**
