Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
