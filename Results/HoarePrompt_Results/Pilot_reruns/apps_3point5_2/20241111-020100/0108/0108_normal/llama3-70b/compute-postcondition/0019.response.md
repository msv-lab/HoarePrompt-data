Example Answer:
The character `char` in variable `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The replacement is done only once. The `res` variable now contains the characters added in each iteration, and `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet.
Output State: **`res` contains the characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet**
