According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the character `char` is present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is added to `res` until it is no longer in `s`, and `s` no longer contains `char`. To execute the loop one more time, the character `char` needs to be present in the string `s`.
State: **`char` is added to `res` until it is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`**
