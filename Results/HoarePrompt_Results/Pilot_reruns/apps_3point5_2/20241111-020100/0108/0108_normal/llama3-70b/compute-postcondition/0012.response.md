According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the character replaced, `char` is in the new `s`. This means that `char` is still in `s` and the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced, `char` is in the new `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
