According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with one character replaced, so for the loop to execute one more time, the new `s` must still contain `char`. No changes are needed for the `alphabet` and `res` variables.
State: **`s` is a string with one character replaced and `char` is in the new `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
