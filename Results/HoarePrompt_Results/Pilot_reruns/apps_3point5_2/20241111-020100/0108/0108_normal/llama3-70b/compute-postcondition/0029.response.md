Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`. The previous values of `res` and `s` are not known, so the output state is: `char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`.
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` repeatedly until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` still contains `char`**
