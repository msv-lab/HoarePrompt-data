According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the characters added in each iteration and `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet. For the loop to execute one more time, the `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet**
