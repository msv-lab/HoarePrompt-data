Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The variable `res` may contain the characters that were replaced in each iteration. Since the loop has executed at least once, `res` contains the characters added in each iteration, and `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet.
Output State: **`res` contains the characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains at least one character that is in the alphabet**
