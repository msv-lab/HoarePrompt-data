Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the `res` variable. This process continues until `char` is no longer in the `s` variable. After each iteration, `char` is added to `res`, and `s` no longer contains `char`. 
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` no longer contains `char`**
