Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The number of replacements is limited to 1. The string `res` is updated with the replaced character. The output state is: `s` is a string with one character replaced, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with one character replaced, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
