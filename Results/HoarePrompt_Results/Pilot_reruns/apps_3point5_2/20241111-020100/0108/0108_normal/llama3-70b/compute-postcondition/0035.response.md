Output State: **If `char` is in `s`, `res` will contain all the characters added in each iteration until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` will no longer contain `char` after the loop finishes. If `char` is not in `s` initially, the loop will not execute, and `res` and `s` will remain unchanged.**
