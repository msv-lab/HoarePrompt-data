Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program iterates through each character of the English alphabet and replaces the characters in the input string s with the next character in alphabetical order until the entire alphabet is found in the input string. If the resulting string has a length of 26 (the length of the alphabet), it prints the resulting string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program is correct as it correctly handles the replacement of characters to form the English alphabet as a subsequence. The program will work for all input strings as it systematically replaces characters to form the required subsequence.
