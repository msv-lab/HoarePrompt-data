Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The string `s` remains unchanged, and `alphabet` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters**
