Output State: **After the loop completes, `res` will contain the characters accumulated from the replacements made in each iteration. If `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, `res` will have characters added and `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If `s` does not contain `char`, the loop will not execute and `res` will remain an empty string. After the loop finishes, `alphabet` will have characters incremented in alphabetical order.**
