Example Answer:
Since `res` is accumulating characters with the replaced character, it will add the value of `char` to itself. As `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, the value of `s` will change accordingly. Since `alphabet` will have at least one more character, the next character in the alphabet after `char` is added to `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: If `s` contains `char`, `res` will accumulate characters with the replaced character, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and `alphabet` will have at least one more character.
Output State: **If `s` contains `char`, `res` will accumulate characters with the replaced character, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and `alphabet` will have at least one more character**
