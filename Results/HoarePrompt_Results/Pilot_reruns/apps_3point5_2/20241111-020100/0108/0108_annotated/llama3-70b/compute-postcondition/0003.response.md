According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `alphabet`. If `alphabet` is a valid list of characters, the loop can execute. Since `alphabet` is not specified in the initial state, we need to adjust it to ensure the loop can run. Additionally, `res` is an empty string, so it does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to: 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters**
