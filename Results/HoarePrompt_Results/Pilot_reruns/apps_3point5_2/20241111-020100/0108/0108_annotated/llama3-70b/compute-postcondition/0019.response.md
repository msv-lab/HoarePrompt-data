Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If `char` is found in `s`, `res` will accumulate characters with the replaced character, and `alphabet` will have at least two more characters. If `char` is not found in `s`, `res` will be empty. 
Output State: **If `s` contains `char`, `res` accumulates characters with the replaced character, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If `s` does not contain `char`, `res` is empty. `alphabet` has at least two more characters.**
