`i` and `j` are both assigned the value 0. Since the initial state does not mention any other variables, the output state is simply `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
