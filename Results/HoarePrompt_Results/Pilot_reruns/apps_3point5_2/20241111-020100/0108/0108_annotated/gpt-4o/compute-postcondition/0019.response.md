Postcondition: ***If the loop executes, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to the minimum of the length of `target` and the length of `s`. If the loop does not execute because `j` is already equal to `target_len`, then the function prints `target`. If the loop does not execute because `i` is already equal to the length of `s`, then the function prints -1. In both cases where the loop executes or not, `i` and `j` retain their initial values based on the conditions mentioned in the precondition.***
