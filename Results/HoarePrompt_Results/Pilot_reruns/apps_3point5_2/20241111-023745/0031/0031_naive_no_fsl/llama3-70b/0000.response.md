Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the total number of days in Udayland.
2. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in the given scenario.
3. The program calculates the irreducible fraction of the probability and then takes the remainder modulo 10^6 + 3 for both the numerator and denominator.
4. The program handles large numbers by performing calculations modulo 10^6 + 3.
5. The program uses the math.gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor and ensures that the numerator and denominator are coprime.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the required probabilities.
