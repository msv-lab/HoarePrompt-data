The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers. The function also has a constant `MOD` set to 1000003. 

After executing the function body, if `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n` bits, the program will print "1, 1" and return. Otherwise, there will be no change in the state of the program variables. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n` bits, it will print "1, 1" and return. Otherwise, there will be no change in the program variables.
