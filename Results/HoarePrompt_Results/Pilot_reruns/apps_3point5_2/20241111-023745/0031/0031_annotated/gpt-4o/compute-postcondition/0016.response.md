According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. Both `i` and `k` meet the conditions for the loop to execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
