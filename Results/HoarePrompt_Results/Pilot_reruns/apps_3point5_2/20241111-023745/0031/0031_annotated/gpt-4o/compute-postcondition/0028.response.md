Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n bits, the function prints "1, 1" and returns. Otherwise, it calculates several operations involving the variables total_days, numerator, denominator, p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared, A, B, and g. Finally, it prints the results of A % MOD and B % MOD. If the code does not behave as described in the annotations, this functionality summary provides a general overview of the program flow without relying solely on the comments.**
