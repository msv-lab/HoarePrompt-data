Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits. The value of `n` is not given. Therefore, the output state is: MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated according to the calculation, denominator is updated by the multiplication with `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated according to the calculation, denominator is updated by the multiplication with `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
