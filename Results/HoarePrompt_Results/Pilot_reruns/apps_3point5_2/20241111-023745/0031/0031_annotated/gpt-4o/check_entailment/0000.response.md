Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days, and then reduces the fraction A/B to its irreducible form modulo 10^6 + 3. The annotations also align with the problem description and provide additional insights into the variables and calculations performed in the code. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are consistent with the expected output of the code. Hence, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
