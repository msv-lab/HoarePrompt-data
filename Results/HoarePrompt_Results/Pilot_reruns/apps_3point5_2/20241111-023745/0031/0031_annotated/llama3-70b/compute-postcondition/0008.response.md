Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, which is 2 raised to the power of `n`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(2^n - 1)`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2^(n+1), `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(2^n - 1)`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2^(n+1), `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
