Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies within the calculation of the `numerator` and `denominator` within the for loop. The `numerator` is not correctly calculated to represent the number of ways in which at least two people share the same birthday among k people. Similarly, the `denominator` is not correctly calculated to represent the total number of possible outcomes.

An example where the code does not work correctly:
Input:
n = 3, k = 2

Expected Output:
1 8

Actual Output:
0 0

In this case, the code does not handle the calculation of the probability as described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect results. The annotations, although providing insight into the state of variables, do not accurately reflect the intended logic required to solve the problem.
