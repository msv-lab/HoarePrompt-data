Example Answer: 
The `denominator` is updated by performing floor division with `gcd`. The previous values of `denominator` and `gcd` are needed to calculate the result. After the operation, the `denominator` is modified accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is updated after dividing by `gcd`, `denominator` is modified based on the loop operations, `gcd` holds the greatest common divisor of the final values.
Output State: **`numerator` is updated after dividing by `gcd`, `denominator` is modified based on the loop operations, `gcd` holds the greatest common divisor of the final values**
