Example Answer: 
After executing the code, `denominator` is divided by `gcd` and the result is assigned back to `denominator`. The variables `numerator` and `gcd` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the result of the division, `denominator` is the updated result after dividing by `gcd`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.
Output State: **`numerator` is the result of the division, `denominator` is the updated result after dividing by `gcd`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator**.
