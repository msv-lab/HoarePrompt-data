Example Answer:
`numerator` is divided by `gcd` using the floor division operator. The value of `numerator` changes accordingly. The previous values of `numerator`, `denominator`, and `gcd` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the result of the division, `denominator` is the result of the multiplication, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.
Output State: **`numerator` is the result of the division, `denominator` is the result of the multiplication, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator**.
