Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the modulo by `MOD`. Since `MOD` is 1000003, the value of `denominator` is updated accordingly. The values of `numerator`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
