The function func_1 accepts two parameters, a and b, and calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b. If b is not 0, it iteratively calculates the greatest common divisor until b becomes 0, at which point a holds the greatest common divisor and b is 0. If b is initially 0, the function returns the initial values of a and b without any changes.
