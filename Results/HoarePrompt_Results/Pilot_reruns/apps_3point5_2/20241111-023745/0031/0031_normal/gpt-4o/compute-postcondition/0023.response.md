Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `A` and `B`. The function `func_1` is called with `A` being the value of `p_shared` and `B` being the value of `p_total`, which are calculated based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator contains the product of (total_days - k + 1) to total_days, denominator contains the product of 1 to total_days, MOD is 1000003, p_no_shared is the same as numerator, p_total is equal to denominator, p_shared is calculated using the formula (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, A is assigned the value of p_shared, B is equal to p_total, and `g` contains the result of `func_1(A, B)`.
Output State: **numerator contains the product of (total_days - k + 1) to total_days, denominator contains the product of 1 to total_days, MOD is 1000003, p_no_shared is the same as numerator, p_total is equal to denominator, p_shared is calculated using the formula (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, A is assigned the value of p_shared, B is equal to p_total, and g contains the result of func_1(A, B)**
