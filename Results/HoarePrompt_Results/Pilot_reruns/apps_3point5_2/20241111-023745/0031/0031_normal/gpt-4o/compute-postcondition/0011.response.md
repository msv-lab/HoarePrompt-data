Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `(total_days - i)` and then taking the modulo with MOD. The values of `total_days`, `i`, and `MOD` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `numerator`. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
