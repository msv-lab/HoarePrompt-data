Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, possibly with leading zeroes. It then compares the two integers and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The code correctly handles the case where the numbers are equal, where `a` is less than `b`, and where `a` is greater than `b`. It also removes any leading zeroes from the input integers before comparison. The output hints also align with the code and confirm that the code meets the requirements of the problem description. Since there are no potential cases identified where the code does not work as expected, the correctness of the code is determined to be True.
