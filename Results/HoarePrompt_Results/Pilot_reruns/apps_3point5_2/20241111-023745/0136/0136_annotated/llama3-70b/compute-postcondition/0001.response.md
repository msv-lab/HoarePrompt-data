Example Answer:
The `input()` function accepts an input and `lstrip('0')` removes any leading zeros from the input. As `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` will be assigned the same value as `a` without any leading zeros. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the same as `a` without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the same as `a` without leading zeros**
