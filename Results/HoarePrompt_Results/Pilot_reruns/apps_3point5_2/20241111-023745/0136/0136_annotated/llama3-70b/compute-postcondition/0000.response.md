Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input string with leading zeros removed. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet as `b` is not mentioned. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` remains unchanged**
