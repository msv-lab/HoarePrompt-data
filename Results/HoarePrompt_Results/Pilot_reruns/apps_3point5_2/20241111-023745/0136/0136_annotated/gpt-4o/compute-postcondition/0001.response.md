Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `data` with leading zeros stripped. If `data` is a list with elements, the first element is accessed and leading zeros are removed. If `data` is an empty list, an error will occur. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeros stripped.
Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeros stripped**
