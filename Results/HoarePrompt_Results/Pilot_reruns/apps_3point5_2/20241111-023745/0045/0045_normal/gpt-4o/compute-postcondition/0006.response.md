According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is at least 1. The loop iterates from `k - 1` to 0, so the loop will execute as long as `k` is not 0. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the function returns -1, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k - 1`.**
