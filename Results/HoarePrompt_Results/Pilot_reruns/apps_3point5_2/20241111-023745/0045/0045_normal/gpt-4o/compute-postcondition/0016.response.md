According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from `k - 1` down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k - 2`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop will break. `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 3`.

State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the function returns -1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k - 3`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program will break out of the loop.
