Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of the division of `n` by `min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the function returns -1, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.**
