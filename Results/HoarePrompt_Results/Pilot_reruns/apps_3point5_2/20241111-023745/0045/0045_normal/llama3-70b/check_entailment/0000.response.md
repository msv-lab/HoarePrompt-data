Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two input values `n` and `k`, representing the total sum and the number of elements in the sequence respectively. It then checks if `n` is less than `k`, in which case it prints -1. Otherwise, it iterates over a range from 1 to `k+1` and appends values to the sequence `seq` such that the sum is equal to `n`. If the length of the sequence is not equal to `k`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.

The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. It creates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal. The output generated by the code is correct and matches the requirements specified in the problem description.
