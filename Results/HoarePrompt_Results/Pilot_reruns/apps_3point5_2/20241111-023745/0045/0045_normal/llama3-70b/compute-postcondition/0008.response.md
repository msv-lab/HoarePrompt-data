The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. If b is greater than 0, the loop will continue to execute until b reaches 0. At this point, a will contain the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b, and b will be 0. If b is 0 initially, the loop will not execute. The function returns the final value of a after the loop execution.
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integer parameters a and b, calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b, and returns the final value of a after the loop execution.**
