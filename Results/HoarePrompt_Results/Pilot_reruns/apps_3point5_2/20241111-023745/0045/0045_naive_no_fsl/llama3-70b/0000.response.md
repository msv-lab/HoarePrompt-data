Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes two integers n and k as input.
2. It then checks if n is less than k, it prints -1 as the answer does not exist.
3. Otherwise, it creates a sequence of k numbers such that each number is strictly increasing and their sum is equal to n.
4. The program iterates through numbers from 1 to k, adding them to the sequence until n is less than the current number. If the sequence is not of length k, it prints -1.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting sequence.
6. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples.
