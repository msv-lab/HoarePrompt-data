Example Answer:
The value of `d` is assigned the result of the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`. There is no information provided about the specific values of `n` and `min_sum`, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k` inclusive. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
