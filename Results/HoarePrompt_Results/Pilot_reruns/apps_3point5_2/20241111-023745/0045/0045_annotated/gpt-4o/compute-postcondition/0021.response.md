According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`, as well as the condition of `remainder` being non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `min_sum` needs to be updated to the sum of integers from 1 to `k`.
2. `n` should be adjusted accordingly.
3. `remainder` needs to be recalculated as `remainder - 2`.
4. `sequence` should be updated with `sequence[i]` incremented by 1.
5. `i` needs to be updated to `k - 4`.
6. If `remainder` is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.

State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `n` is adjusted accordingly, `remainder` is recalculated as `remainder - 2`, `sequence` is updated with `sequence[i]` incremented by 1, `i` is `k-4`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If remainder is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.**
