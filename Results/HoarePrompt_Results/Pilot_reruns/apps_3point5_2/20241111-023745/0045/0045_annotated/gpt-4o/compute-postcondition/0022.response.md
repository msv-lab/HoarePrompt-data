Output State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the loop does not execute and the function returns -1. If the loop executes, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k-1` inclusive, `n` is adjusted accordingly, `remainder` is decremented by the number of executed iterations, `sequence` is updated with elements incremented by 1, `i` starts at `k-1` and decrements by 1 each iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `remainder` becomes 0, the loop exits.**
