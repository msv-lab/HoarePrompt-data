Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum sum of integers from 1 to `k` inclusive, checks if it is greater than `n`, adjusts the values accordingly, and generates the sequence of `k` positive numbers with their sum equal to `n` and greatest common divisor is maximal. The annotations also align with the logic of the code and do not provide any conflicting information with the problem description. Thus, the code is correct.
