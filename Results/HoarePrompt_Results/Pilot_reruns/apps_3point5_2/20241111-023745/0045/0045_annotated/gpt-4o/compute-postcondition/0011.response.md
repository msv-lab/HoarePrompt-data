According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k-2`. 
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k-1` inclusive, `n` is adjusted accordingly, `remainder` is recalculated as `remainder - 1`, `sequence` is updated, `i` is `k-2` with `sequence[i]` incremented by 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
