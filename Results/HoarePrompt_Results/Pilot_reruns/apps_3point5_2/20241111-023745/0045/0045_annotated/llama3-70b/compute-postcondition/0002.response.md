Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b` and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact values after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and the new values of `a` and `b` are unknown.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and the new values of `a` and `b` are unknown**
