According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the boolean variable `b`. If `b` evaluates to True, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, no specific information is given about the variables `n` and `k`. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10**
