According to the code, the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, and `r` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated accordingly, `i` is incremented by 1**
