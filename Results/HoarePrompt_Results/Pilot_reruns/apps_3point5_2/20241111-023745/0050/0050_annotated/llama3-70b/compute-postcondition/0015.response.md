Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` maintain their initial values from the input. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `r` is updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by `s[i]`. `shares` is updated to include the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. `i` is updated for the next iteration in the loop. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop is exited without any changes to the variables. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios of the program fragment.***
