Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` maintain their initial values, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, `r` is updated with the result of `r` modulo `s[i]`, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks and the program exits. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block.***
