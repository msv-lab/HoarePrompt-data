Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0. If shares > 0, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, all other variables maintain their initial values. If shares <= 0, `shares` are updated based on the division of `r` and `s[i]`, `r` is updated accordingly.***
