Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, and `max_sell_price` are positive integers within the specified ranges. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `max_shares` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the given amount `r` at the minimum price, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is a positive integer value calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. All variables retain their initial values and relationships as specified in the precondition after the execution of the if else block, considering all edge cases and boundary values.***
