Example Answer:
`max_shares` is assigned the value of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. The value of `r` is a positive integer, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, which is also a positive integer. Therefore, `max_shares` will be a positive integer representing the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the given amount `r` and at the minimum price.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input splitting, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, `max_shares` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the given amount `r` at the minimum price**
