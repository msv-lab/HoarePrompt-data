Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input splitting, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, `max_shares` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the given amount `r` at the minimum price, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.**
