Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the number of bourles held.
2. It then reads the prices of buying and selling shares into lists.
3. It calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price.
4. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the current number of bourles held.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the current bourles and the remaining bourles after buying shares.
6. It then calculates the total bourles after selling all shares bought at the maximum sell price.
7. Finally, it prints the total bourles after the evening.

The program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all potential cases.
