Example Answer:
The variable `max_shares` is assigned the value of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. The previous values of the variables are `n`, `m`, and `r` as input integers, `b` as a list of integers, `min_buy_price` as the minimum value in list `b`, and `max_sell_price` as the maximum value in list `b`. After execution, the output state will be the same as the initial state with the addition of `max_shares` being calculated.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`**
