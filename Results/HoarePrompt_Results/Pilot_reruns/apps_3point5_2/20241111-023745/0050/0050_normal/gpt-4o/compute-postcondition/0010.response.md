Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, then the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as the total amount of bourles. The function then prints `total_bourles`, encompassing all possible scenarios and edge cases involving the given input variables.***
