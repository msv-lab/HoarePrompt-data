Example Answer:
The value of `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`. The previous values are known: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`**
