Example Answer:
The variable `shares` is assigned the value 0. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are already assigned values derived from the input split into integers. Variable `b` is a list containing those values sorted in descending order. Since the newly assigned variable `shares` is the only one affected by the code, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `b` is a list containing those values sorted in descending order; `shares` is 0**
