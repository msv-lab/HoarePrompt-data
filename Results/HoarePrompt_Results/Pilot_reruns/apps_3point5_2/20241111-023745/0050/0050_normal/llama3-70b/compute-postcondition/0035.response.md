Example Answer:
`shares` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `n`, `r`, `i`, and `b[i]` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on shares and b[i] if shares is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `shares` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on shares and b[i] if shares is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `shares` is 0**
