Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on shares and b[i] if shares is greater than 0. In this case, `i` remains 1 and `shares` is set to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, `n` is still greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `i` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
