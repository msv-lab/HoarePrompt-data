Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned values from the input split by space, converted to integers. The input values are such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000. Therefore, the output state is: x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000**
