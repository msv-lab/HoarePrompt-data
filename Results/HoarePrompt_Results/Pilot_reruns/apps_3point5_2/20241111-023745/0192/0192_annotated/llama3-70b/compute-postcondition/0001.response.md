Example Answer:
The absolute difference between x and y is calculated using the abs() function. The values of x and y are based on user input, satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the output state is x and y are assigned integer values based on user input satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between x and y is printed.
Output State: **x and y are assigned integer values based on user input satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between x and y is printed**
