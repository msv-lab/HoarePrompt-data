Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The program takes two integers x and y as input, calculates the absolute difference between x and y, and then prints the result. This logic is valid for all potential cases as it follows the problem description accurately. The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle, and it produces the correct output for all given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
