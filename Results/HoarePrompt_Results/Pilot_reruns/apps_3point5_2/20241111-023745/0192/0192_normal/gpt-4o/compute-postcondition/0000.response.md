Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are assigned by splitting the input into integers. Since the input is not specified, the values of `x` and `y` can vary within the specified constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000**
