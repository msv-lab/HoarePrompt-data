Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, where `x` and `y` are integers. Given that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, the result will always be half of the difference between `x` and `y`, rounded down, plus any remainder if the difference is odd. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000**
