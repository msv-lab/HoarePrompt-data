Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using the `abs()` function and then prints the result. Since the initial state indicates that `x` and `y` are valid integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the absolute difference between `x` and `y` will always be a valid positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are valid integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are valid integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed**
