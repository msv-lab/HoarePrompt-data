Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. The code does not consider that Memory can only modify the length of a single side of the current triangle in a way that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area) and that the length of each side should be an integer. The code does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the desired equilateral triangle of side length y. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
