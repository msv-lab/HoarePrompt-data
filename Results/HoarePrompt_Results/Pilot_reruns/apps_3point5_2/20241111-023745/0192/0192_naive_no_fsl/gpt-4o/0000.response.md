Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The program takes the input values of x and y, calculates the absolute difference between x and y, then divides it by 2. If there is a remainder after division, it adds 1 to account for the extra operation needed. This logic aligns with the problem description and all provided examples, ensuring that the program is correct for all potential cases.
