Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting side length and the ending side length of the equilateral triangle. However, this does not take into account the fact that in each second, only one side length can be modified to maintain a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the program does not provide the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. An example where the program does not work correctly is:

Input:
6 3

Output:
3

Expected Output:
4

In this case, the program should output 4 as it should consider the minimum number of seconds required to transform the equilateral triangle of side length 6 to side length 3.
