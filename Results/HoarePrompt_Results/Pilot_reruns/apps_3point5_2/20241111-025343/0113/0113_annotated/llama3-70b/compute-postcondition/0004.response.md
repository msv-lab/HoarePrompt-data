Example Answer: 
`n` is incremented by 1, so if `n` was initially a positive integer plus 2, it will now be the previous positive integer plus 3. The value of `k` remains the same, and `x` is recalculated as 10 to the power of `k` with the updated value of `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer plus 3, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is recalculated as 10 to the power of `k` with the updated value of `n`**
