According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n`, `x`. If `n % x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is increased by 1, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is increased by 2 because `n % x != 0` with an increment of 1 in `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is increased by 2, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same**
