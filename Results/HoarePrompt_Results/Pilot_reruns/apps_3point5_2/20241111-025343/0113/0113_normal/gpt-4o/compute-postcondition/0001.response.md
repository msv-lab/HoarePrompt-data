Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and the value of `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 8. The `multiplier` is calculated based on the value of `k`. The output state will depend on the values of `n`, `k`, and `multiplier` after the calculation.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `n`, `k`, and `multiplier` after the calculation**
