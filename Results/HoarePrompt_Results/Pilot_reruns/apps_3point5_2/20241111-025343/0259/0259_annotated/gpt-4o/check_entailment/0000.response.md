Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem description. The annotations mention that if `n` is less than 1 or `bus_routes` is an empty list, the loop won't execute, and `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity, and `chosen_route` will remain -1. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case. Therefore, the code should handle this scenario explicitly by either returning an error message for invalid input or by following a specified behavior as mentioned in the problem description.

Since the code does not cover all potential cases as specified in the problem description, the correctness of the code is false.
