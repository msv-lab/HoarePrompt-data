Output State: **If n is at least 1 and bus_routes is a non-empty list, after the loop executes `min_wait_time` contains the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. If n is less than 1 or bus_routes is an empty list, the loop doesn't execute and min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1.**
