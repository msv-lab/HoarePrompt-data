According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum value between the previous `min_wait_time` and the newly calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of the current bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the current bus route.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Depending on the conditions `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0` and `s_i >= t`, the values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` need to be recalculated based on the new values.

State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the recalculated minimum value between the previous `min_wait_time` and the newly calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the recalculated index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the recalculated source of the current bus route, `d_i` is the recalculated destination of the current bus route**
