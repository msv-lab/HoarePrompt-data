Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the recalculated minimum value between the previous `min_wait_time` and the newly calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the recalculated index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the source of the bus route at index 1 in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the destination of the bus route at index 1 in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is 0**
