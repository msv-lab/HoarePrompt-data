Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the input values from the user. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list. `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity.**
