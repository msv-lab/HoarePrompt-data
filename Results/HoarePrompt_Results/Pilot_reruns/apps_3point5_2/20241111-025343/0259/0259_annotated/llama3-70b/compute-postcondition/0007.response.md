Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are taken from user input, so the tuple contains the values input by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, where `s` and `d` are the integers input by the user.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, where `s` and `d` are the integers input by the user**
