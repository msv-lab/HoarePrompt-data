According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer. At the start of the loop, the `buses` list must be empty. Additionally, since `t` is mentioned but not used in the loop, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list**
