Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values based on the input from the user after splitting. Since the initial state does not mention input values, the output state will be: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are assigned values based on user input**.
