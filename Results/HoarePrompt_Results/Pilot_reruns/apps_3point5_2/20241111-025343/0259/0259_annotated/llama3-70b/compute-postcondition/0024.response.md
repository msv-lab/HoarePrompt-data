Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers. `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples. `i` is 0. `s` and `d` represent the values of the second tuple in the list. `min_time` is the minimum of the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d` and the current value of `min_time`. `ans` is set to the index `i + 1` corresponding to the minimum time found. `time` is the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`.***
