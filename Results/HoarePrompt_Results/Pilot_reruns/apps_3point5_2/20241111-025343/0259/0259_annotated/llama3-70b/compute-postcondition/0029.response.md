Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the third tuple in the list, `min_time` is the minimum of the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d` and the current value of `min_time`, `ans` is set to the index `i + 1` corresponding to the minimum time found, `time` is the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`. If `time` is less than the current `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. This ensures that the program keeps track of the minimum time and the corresponding index in the list of buses.***
