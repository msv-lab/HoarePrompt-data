Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The initial state of `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`. Therefore, after execution, the list `buses` will have an additional tuple `(s, d)`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`**
