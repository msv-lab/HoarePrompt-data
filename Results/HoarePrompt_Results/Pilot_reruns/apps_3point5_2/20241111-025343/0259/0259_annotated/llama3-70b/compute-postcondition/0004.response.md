Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, so the exact values are unknown. The `buses` list now contains one tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains one tuple, `s` and `d` have user input values.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains one tuple, `s` and `d` have user input values**
