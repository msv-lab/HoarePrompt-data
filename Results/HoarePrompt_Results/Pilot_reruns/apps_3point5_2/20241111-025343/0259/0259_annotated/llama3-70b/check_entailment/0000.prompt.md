You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It is raining heavily. But this is the first day for Serval, who just became 3 years old, to go to the kindergarten. Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

As Serval's best friend, you wonder which bus route will he get on. If several buses arrive at the same time, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $t$ ($1\leq n\leq 100$, $1\leq t\leq 10^5$) — the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers $s_i$ and $d_i$ ($1\leq s_i,d_i\leq 10^5$) — the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route.


-----Output-----

Print one number — what bus route Serval will use. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
6 4
9 5

Output
1

Input
5 5
3 3
2 5
5 6
4 9
6 1

Output
3

Input
3 7
2 2
2 3
2 4

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the first bus of the first route arrives at time $6$, and the first bus of the second route arrives at time $9$, so the first route is the answer.

In the second example, a bus of the third route arrives at time $5$, so it is the answer.

In the third example, buses of the first route come at times $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and so fourth, buses of the second route come at times $2$, $5$, $8$, and so fourth and buses of the third route come at times $2$, $6$, $10$, and so on, so $1$ and $2$ are both acceptable answers while $3$ is not.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    #State of the program here: `n` and `t` are positive integers
    buses = []
    #State of the program here: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `buses` is an empty list
    for _ in range(n):
        s, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        buses.append((s, d))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, and `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the input values from the user. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.
    min_time = float('inf')
    #State of the program here: After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the input values from the user. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list. `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity.
    ans = -1
    #State of the program here: After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the input values from the user. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list. `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity.
    for (i, (s, d)) in enumerate(buses):
        time = (t - s) % d
        
        if time < min_time:
            min_time = time
            ans = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, `buses` contains tuples with at least one tuple, `min_time` is the minimum of the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `ans` is set to the index `i + 1` corresponding to the minimum time found. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.
    print(ans)
    #State of the program here: If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, `buses` contains tuples with at least one tuple, `min_time` is the minimum of the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `ans` is set to the index `i + 1` corresponding to the minimum time found. If n is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func` reads input values `n` and `t` as positive integers, and then reads `n` pairs of integers as input to populate a list `buses`. It calculates the minimum time based on the given formula and prints the corresponding index `i + 1`. If `n` is 0, no input is read, and the list `buses` remains empty. The function does not explicitly return any value.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
