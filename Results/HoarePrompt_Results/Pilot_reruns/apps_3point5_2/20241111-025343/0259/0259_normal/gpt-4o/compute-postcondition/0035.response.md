The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameters `n` and `t` are positive integers representing the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station, respectively. The parameter `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively.

After executing the function body, the loop correctly determines the minimum wait time and the chosen route based on the provided bus routes and input parameters. The output state includes the minimum wait time stored in `min_wait_time` and the index of the chosen route stored in `chosen_route`. The loop efficiently handles all possible scenarios and ensures the variables are updated accurately throughout the iterations. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine the minimum wait time and the chosen route based on the provided bus routes and input parameters, while efficiently handling all possible scenarios and ensuring accurate variable updates throughout the iterations.
