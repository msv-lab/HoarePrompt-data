**Precondition**: **n is an integer representing the number of bus routes, t is an integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers s_i and d_i representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route. All integers are such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= t <= 10^5, 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5.**
