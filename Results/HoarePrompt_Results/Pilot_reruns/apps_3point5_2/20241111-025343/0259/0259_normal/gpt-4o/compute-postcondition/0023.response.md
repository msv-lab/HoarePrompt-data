Example Answer:
The tuple at index `i` in the list `bus_routes` is unpacked into variables `s_i` and `d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` depend on the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`. The values of `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` are positive integers and a list of tuples, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers.
Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` are positive integers and a list of tuples, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers**
