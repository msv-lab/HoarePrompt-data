Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i` are positive integers, so the calculation will result in a positive wait time. The other variables are not affected by this calculation.
Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` are positive integers and a list of tuples, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers, `wait_time` is a positive integer**
