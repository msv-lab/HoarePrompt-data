According to the code, the loop will execute n times. Before the loop starts, n is already a positive integer, so that condition is met. The loop uses the variable i to iterate through the range of n, so the initial value of i needs to be adjusted to 0. The loop also initializes min_wait_time to positive infinity, so no adjustment is needed there. Lastly, chosen_route is set to -1 before the loop, so it should remain as is.
State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0**
