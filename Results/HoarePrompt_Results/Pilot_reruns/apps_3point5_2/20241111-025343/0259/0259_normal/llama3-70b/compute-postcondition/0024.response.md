Postcondition: ***`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the original `min_time` and the newly calculated `time`. `ans` is updated to the index of the bus with the minimum time value plus 1. `buses` remains a list with at least 1 element. `i` is incremented by 1. `s` and `d` retain their values from the second element in the `buses` list. `time` is recalculated as `(t - s) % d`.***
