Postcondition: ***`min_time` is set to the minimum calculated time value among all elements in the `buses` list, `ans` is updated to the index of the bus with the minimum time value plus 1. `buses` remains a list with at least 1 element, `i` is set to 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first element in the `buses` list, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If there are multiple buses with the same minimum time value, `ans` will be updated to the index of the first occurrence. If `buses` has only 1 element, `ans` will be 1 and `min_time` will be the time calculated for that bus.***
