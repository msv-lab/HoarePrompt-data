According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than the iteration count, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2. To execute the loop one more time, `n` should be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `t` is an integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`**
