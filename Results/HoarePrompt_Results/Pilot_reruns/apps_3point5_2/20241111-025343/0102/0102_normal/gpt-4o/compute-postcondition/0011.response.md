The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. It also assumes the existence of three lists: `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`, containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, eleven to nineteen, and tens places in numbers, respectively. 

After executing the function body, if `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representing the number in the ones range from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representing the number in the teens range from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list if `n` is a multiple of 10. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list and the string representing the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list separated by a hyphen.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, within the specified range, and return the string representation of the number based on the given conditions, handling all edge cases appropriately. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n between 0 and 99, returns the string representation of the number based on specified conditions and available lists of ones, teens, and tens.**
