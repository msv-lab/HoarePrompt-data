Example Answer:
The function returns the element from the `tens` list corresponding to the tens place of the integer `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n // 10` gives the tens place digit. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers, and the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers, and the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`**
