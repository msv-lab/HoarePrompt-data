Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` between 0 and 99 as input and returns the string representation of the number according to the specified conditions. 
- If `n` is between 0 and 9, it correctly returns the string representing the number in the ones range from the `ones` list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19, it correctly returns the string representing the number in the teens range from the `teens` list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99, and is a multiple of 10, it correctly returns the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99, and is not a multiple of 10, it correctly returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list and the string representing the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list separated by a hyphen.

The code covers all the valid cases within the specified range of `n` and provides the correct string representation for each case. The output hints also align with the code logic and confirm that the code is correctly implementing the problem description.
