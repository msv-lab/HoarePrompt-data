Functionality: The function `func` does not accept any parameters but prompts the user to input an integer between 0 and 99. It then determines the English word equivalent of the input number and prints it out. If the input is less than 10, it prints the number as a word directly from the `ones` list. If the input is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For inputs 20 or greater, it constructs the word by combining the tens and ones places from the `tens` and `ones` lists, respectively. If the input is a multiple of 10, no hyphen is added between the tens and ones values. The function does not return any value.
