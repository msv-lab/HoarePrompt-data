Postcondition: ***0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `s` is an input integer. If s < 10, the program prints the value stored in the `ones` list at index s. If s is between 10 and 19, the program prints the value stored in the `teens` list at index s-10. If s is 20 or greater, the program prints the concatenation of the value at index s//10 in the `tens` list and the value at index s%10 in the `ones` list. If s is a multiple of 10, no hyphen is added between the `tens` and `ones` values.***
