Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly converts an integer score into its English word equivalent as per the problem description. It handles the cases where the input is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and 20 or greater by selecting the appropriate words from the predefined lists. The code also handles cases where the input is a multiple of 10 by not adding a hyphen between the tens and ones values. 

The output hints also confirm that the function `func` behaves as described in the problem statement, making sure that the code indeed follows the problem description for all potential cases.
