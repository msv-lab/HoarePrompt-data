Example Answer: 
The function returns the value at the index `n - 10` in the list `teens`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, the index will be valid, and the corresponding value will be returned. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99**
