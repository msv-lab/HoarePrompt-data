The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the ones place digit of `n`. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the value corresponding to the teens array at index (n - 10). If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the value at the tens place of `n` from the tens array. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the combination of the tens place value followed by a hyphen and the ones place value of `n`. For all other cases, the program does not return anything. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n`, and based on the value of `n`, return different outputs according to the specified conditions. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. It returns the ones place digit of n if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the value corresponding to the teens array at index (n - 10) if 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the tens place value if n is divisible by 10 and a combination of tens place value followed by a hyphen and ones place value if n is not divisible by 10 and for all other cases it does not return anything.**
