Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `s` can range from 0 to 99. The list `tens` representing tens places in English numbers is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in English numbers**
