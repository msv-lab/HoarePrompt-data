Example Answer:
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`. The initial values are `n` (2 <= n <= 100), `min_pos` holding the index of 1, `max_pos` being `n - 1`, `dist1` being `max_pos`, `dist2` being 0, and `dist3` being the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, `dist1` is assigned the value of `n-1`, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in the list `a`, and `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, `dist1` is assigned the value of `n-1`, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in the list `a`, and `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`**
