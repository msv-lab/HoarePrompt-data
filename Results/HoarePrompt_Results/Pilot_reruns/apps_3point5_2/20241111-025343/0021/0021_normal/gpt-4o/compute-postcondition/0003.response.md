Example Answer:
The variable `max_pos` is assigned the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`, and `n` is between 2 and 100. Since the list is indexed starting from 0, the index of `n` in the list `a` would be `n-1`. Therefore, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`. The value of `min_pos` which holds the index of 1 in the list `a` is not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`**
