Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, `dist1` is assigned the value of `n-1`, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in the list `a`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`, and `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.**
