Example Answer:
The code assigns the index of element `n` in list `a` to `posn`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `n` is in the range of 2 to 100, the index of `n` will be a valid index in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, and `posn` is the index of element `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, and `posn` is the index of element `n` in list `a`**
