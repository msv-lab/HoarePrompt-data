Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- It correctly calculates the maximum distance between the index of element 1 and the index of element `n`, subtracting 1, and the minimum distance between these indices, subtracting 1.
- Finally, the code prints the maximum value between the calculated maximum distance and `n - 1 - min_dist`.
- The code handles the edge cases where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array (i.e., the distance is already maximized) and also considers the case where only one swap can be made to maximize the distance.
