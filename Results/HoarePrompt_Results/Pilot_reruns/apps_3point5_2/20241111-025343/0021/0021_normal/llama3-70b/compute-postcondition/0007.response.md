The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to output the sum of all integers in list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the sum of all integers in the list `a` which contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
