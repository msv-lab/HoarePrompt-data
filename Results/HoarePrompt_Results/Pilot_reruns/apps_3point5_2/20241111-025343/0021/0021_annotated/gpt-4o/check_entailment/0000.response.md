Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the size of the permutation `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. Then, it calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by finding the indices of 1 and n in the list and taking the absolute differences from the ends of the list. Finally, it prints the maximum distance achieved by performing exactly one swap. The code annotations provide a clear explanation of what each part of the code is doing, and the logic within the code aligns with the problem description. All the given examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.
