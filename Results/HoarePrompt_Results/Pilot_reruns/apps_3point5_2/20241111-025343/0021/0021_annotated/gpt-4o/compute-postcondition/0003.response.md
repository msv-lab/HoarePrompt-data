Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of integers. The index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a` is stored in `max_pos`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`**
