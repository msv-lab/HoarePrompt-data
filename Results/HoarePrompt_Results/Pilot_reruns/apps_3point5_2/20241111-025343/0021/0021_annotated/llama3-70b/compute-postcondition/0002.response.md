Example Answer:
The index of the integer 1 in the list `a` is assigned to the variable `pos1`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and n, and 1 is guaranteed to be in the list, the value of `pos1` will be the index where 1 is located in the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`**
