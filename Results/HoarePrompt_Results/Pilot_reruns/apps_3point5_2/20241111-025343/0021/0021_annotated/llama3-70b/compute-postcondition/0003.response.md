Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the index method. Since `n` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `posn` will be the index of the maximum value in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of the maximum value in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of the maximum value in the list `a`**
