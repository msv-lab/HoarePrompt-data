Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. The code correctly handles scenarios where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array, as well as cases where a swap is needed to maximize the distance. The annotations provide examples that align with the problem description, and the code logic reflects those examples accurately. Therefore, the code is correct.
