Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the index of 1 and the index of the maximum value in the list, as well as the minimum distance between these indices. Finally, it prints the maximum of these distances or `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not return any value, it only prints the result.**
