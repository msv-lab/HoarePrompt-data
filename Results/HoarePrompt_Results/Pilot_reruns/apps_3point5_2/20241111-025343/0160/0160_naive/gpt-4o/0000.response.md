Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values N, K, and the sequence A.
2. The program then calculates the sum of the elements in A which will be used later.
3. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in A.
4. The function `func_2` correctly calculates all the divisors of the sum of the elements in A.
5. The program then iterates through the divisors in descending order and checks if the current divisor satisfies the condition that it divides every element in A after the operations.
6. If the condition is satisfied for a divisor, it prints that divisor as the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given constraints.
