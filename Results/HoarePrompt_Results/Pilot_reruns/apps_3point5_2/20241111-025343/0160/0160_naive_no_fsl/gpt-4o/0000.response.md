Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values and calculates the sum of the elements in the list A.
2. The program defines two functions: `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor of a list of numbers and `func_2` to find all the divisors of a given number.
3. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor of the list A and finds all the divisors of the sum of elements in A.
4. Finally, the program checks for each divisor if it divides every element of A after the operations, considering the constraints given in the problem description.
5. If a divisor is found that satisfies the condition, it is printed as the output.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and handles the constraints provided. Since there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is True.
