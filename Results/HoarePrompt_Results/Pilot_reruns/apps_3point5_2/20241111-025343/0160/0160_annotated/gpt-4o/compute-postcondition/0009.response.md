According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing 1, the integer division result of `x` by 1, `i`, and the new integer division result of `x` by `i` if `x % i == 0, which covers all possible divisors of the perfect square `x`.
To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the current value. 
State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1, the integer division result of `x` by 1, the previous `i`, and the new integer division result of `x` by the previous `i` if `x % i == 0. This covers all possible divisors of the perfect square `x`, including 1, the square root of `x`, and all integers that evenly divide `x`.**
