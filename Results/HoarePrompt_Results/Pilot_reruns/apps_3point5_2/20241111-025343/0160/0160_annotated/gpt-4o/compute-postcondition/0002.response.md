Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is 1, after execution, `divisors` will contain 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` contains 1, `x` is a perfect square, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`divisors` contains 1, `x` is a perfect square, `i` is 1**
