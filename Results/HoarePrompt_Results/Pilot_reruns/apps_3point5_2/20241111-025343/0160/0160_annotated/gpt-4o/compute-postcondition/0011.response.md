Example Answer:
The set `divisors` adds the integer division result of `x` by the previous value of `i`. The previous values in the set were 1, the integer division result of `x` by 1, the previous `i`, and the new integer division result of `x` by the previous `i`, and the added value `i`. After adding `x // i` to the set, the new state of `divisors` will include the new integer division result of `x` by `i`. 
Output State: **`divisors` now contains 1, the integer division result of `x` by 1, the previous `i`, the new integer division result of `x` by the previous `i`, the added value `i`, and the new integer division result of `x` by `i`**
