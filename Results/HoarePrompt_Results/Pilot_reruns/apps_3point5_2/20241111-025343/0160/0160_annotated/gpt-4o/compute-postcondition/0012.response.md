Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing 1, the integer division result of `x` by 1, the previous `i`, and the new integer division result of `x` by the previous `i` if `x % i == 0. Additionally, if `x % i == 0`, `divisors` is updated to include the value of `i` and the new integer division result of `x` by `i`, covering all possible divisors of the perfect square `x`, including 1, the square root of `x`, and all integers that evenly divide `x`.***
