Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The first function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of a list of integers, which aligns with the problem description of finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
2. The second function `func_2` calculates the divisors of an integer, which can be used to determine the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A. The function handles cases where an integer is a perfect square and returns all its divisors, which helps in finding the correct output as per the problem description.
3. Both functions are correctly implemented based on the problem requirements and annotations provided. The functions cover all potential cases and scenarios mentioned in the problem description.
