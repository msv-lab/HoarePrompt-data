Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by the value of `i` using integer division, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` originally contains 1, the integer division result of `x` by 1, and `i`. After this operation, the new integer division result is added to the set `divisors`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains 1, the integer division result of x by 1, `i`, and the new integer division result of x by i**.
