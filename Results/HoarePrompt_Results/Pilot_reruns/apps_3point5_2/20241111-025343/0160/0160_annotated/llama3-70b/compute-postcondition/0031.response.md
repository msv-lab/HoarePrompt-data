Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two positive integers N and K from input, followed by a list A of N positive integers. It then calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A and finds the maximum divisor of that gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor. The function does not have a return value. **
