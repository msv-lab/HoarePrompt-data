According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3**
