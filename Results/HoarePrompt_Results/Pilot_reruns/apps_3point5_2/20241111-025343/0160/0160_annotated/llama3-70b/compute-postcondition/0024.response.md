Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. 
Given that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is 3, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum between 3 and `gcd // 3`.
Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `max_divisor` is the maximum value between 3 and `gcd // 3`**
