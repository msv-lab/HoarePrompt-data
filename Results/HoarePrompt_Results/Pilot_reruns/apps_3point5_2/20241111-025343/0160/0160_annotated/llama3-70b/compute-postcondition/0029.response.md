Output State: **If `gcd` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop calculates the maximum divisor of `gcd` and stores it in `max_divisor`. The variables `gcd`, `i`, and `max_divisor` maintain their initial values and relationships throughout the loop execution. The program prints the value of `max_divisor`.**
