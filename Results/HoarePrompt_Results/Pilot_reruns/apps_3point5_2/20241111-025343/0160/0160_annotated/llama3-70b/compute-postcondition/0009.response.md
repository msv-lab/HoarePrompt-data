According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `N`, so `i` should be updated to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is greater than or equal to 2, i is 4, A is a list of N positive integers with at least 1 element, gcd is updated with the greatest common divisor between its previous value and A[i]**
