Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 2, the result of `gcd // i` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, `max_divisor` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and this positive integer. The value of `i` does not change. 
Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`**
