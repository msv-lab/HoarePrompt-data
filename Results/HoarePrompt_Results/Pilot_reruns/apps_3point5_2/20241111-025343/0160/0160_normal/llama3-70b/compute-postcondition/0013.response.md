Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `i` is 1, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum of the two, which is `max_divisor`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, max_divisor is the maximum of its previous value and 1.
Output State: **N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, max_divisor is the maximum of its previous value and 1**
