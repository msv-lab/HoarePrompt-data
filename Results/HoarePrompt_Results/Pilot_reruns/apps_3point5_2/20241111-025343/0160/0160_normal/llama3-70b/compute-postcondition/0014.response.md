Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `i` is 1, `gcd // i` will always be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `max_divisor` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and 1. 
Output State: **N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, max_divisor is the maximum of its previous value and 1**
