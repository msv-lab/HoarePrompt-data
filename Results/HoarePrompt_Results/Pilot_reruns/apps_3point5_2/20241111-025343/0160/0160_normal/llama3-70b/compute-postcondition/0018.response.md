Example Answer:
max_divisor is assigned the maximum value between max_divisor and i. Since i is initialized as 2, and max_divisor is a positive integer greater than 1, the new value of max_divisor will be the maximum between the previous max_divisor and 2. Therefore, the Output State is: N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, max_divisor is the maximum value between its previous value and 2.
Output State: **N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, max_divisor is the maximum value between its previous value and 2**
