Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes the input of N, K, and the list of integers A.
- It calculates the sum of all elements in A and finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A using the provided `func_1` function.
- It then finds all the divisors of the sum of A using the `func_2` function and checks if there exists a positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
- The code iterates through the divisors in reverse order and checks if the condition `(a % d == 0 or (sum_A - a) % d <= K for a in A)` holds true for each divisor.
- If the condition is met for a divisor, it prints that divisor as the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
- The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints align with the code logic. The code correctly implements the operations and finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
