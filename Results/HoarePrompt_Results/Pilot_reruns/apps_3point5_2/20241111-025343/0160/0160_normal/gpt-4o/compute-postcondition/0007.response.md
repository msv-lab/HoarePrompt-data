Example Answer:
The value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `x` is a positive number and `i` is 2, `x // i` will result in an integer value. The set `divisors` already contains 1, `x`, and `i`, so after executing the code, the new set will include the result of `x // i`. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1, `x`, `i`, and the result of `x // i`**
