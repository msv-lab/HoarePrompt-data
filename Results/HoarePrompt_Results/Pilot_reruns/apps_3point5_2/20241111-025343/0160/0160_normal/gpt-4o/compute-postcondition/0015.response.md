Example Answer:
The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` inclusively and adds the divisors of `x` to the set `divisors`. As `x` is a positive number, the loop will execute and the set `divisors` will be updated. The return statement will sort the set `divisors` in reverse order. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, where `x` is a positive number, and the function returns a sorted list of divisors in reverse order**
