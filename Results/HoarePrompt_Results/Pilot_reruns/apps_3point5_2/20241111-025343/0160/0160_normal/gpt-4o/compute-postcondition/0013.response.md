According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, where `x` is a positive number greater than 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous square root of `x`. This adjustment will allow the loop to continue until `i` reaches the square root of `x` inclusively. 
State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1 and `x`, where `x` is a positive number greater than 1.**
