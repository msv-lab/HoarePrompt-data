The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is a positive number. The function returns a sorted list of divisors in reverse order. The set `divisors` contains 1 and `x`, and the list of divisors is sorted in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive number `x` and return a sorted list of divisors in reverse order, where the divisors include 1 and `x`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive number `x` and returns a sorted list of divisors in reverse order, including 1 and `x`.**
