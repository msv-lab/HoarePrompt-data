Example Answer:
`i` is added to the set `divisors`, so the set `divisors` now contains 1, `x`, and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing 1, `x`, and `i`, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1, `x`, and `i`, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 2**
