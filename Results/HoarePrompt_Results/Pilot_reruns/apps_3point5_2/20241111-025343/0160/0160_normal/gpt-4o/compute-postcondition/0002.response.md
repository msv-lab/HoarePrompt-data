The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`, and `i` is 1. After execution, the set `divisors` will contain the value 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing 1, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 1, `x` is a positive number, `i` is 1**
