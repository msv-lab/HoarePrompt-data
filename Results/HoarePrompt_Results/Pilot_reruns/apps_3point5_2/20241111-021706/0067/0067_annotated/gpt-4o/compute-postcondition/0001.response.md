Example Answer:
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer. The previous values of `y` and `z` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
