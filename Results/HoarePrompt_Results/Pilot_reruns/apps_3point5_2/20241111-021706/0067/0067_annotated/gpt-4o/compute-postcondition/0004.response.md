Example Answer:
`max_downvotes` is assigned the value `y + z`, where `y` is a non-negative integer and `z` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= z <= 100. Therefore, after execution, `max_downvotes` will be the sum of `y` and `z`. The other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= y <= 100, `z` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= z <= 100, `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`**
