Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user input. It then compares these values in a series of if-else statements and prints certain characters ('+', '-', '0', or '?') based on the conditions. However, the purpose of these comparisons and the intended output of the function are not clearly defined in the annotations. As such, the exact functionality of the function remains ambiguous.**
