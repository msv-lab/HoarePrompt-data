Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input values of x, y, and z. Then it checks the conditions to determine the result (+, -, or ?) as per the problem description. 

For all possible cases of x, y, and z within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 100), the program will produce the correct output according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
