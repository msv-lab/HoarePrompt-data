Example Answer:
The input is split and converted to integers, which are then assigned to variables x, y, and z. The values of x, y, and z are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
