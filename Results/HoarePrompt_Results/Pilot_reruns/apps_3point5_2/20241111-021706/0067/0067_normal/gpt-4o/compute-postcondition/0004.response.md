Example Answer:
`max_downvotes` is assigned the value `y + z`, where `y` is the previous value of y and `z` is a new variable. The other variables are `min_upvotes` assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` in the range between `x` and `x + 100` inclusive, and `min_downvotes` assigned the value of `y`. So, the Output State is: `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is in the range between `x` and `x + 100` inclusive, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`.
Output State: **`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is in the range between `x` and `x + 100` inclusive, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`**
