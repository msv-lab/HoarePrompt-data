Postcondition: ***`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is in the range between `x` and `x + 100` inclusive, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, the program prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'.***
