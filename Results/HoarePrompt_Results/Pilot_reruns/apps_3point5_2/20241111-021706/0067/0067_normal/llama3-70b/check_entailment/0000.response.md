Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` to determine the result according to the rules specified in the problem description. The cases where the result can be determined ('+', '-', '0') are handled accurately, and the uncertain case ('?') is also considered. Additionally, the output hints align with the code's functionality and do not provide any conflicting information. Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, we can conclude that the program is correct.
