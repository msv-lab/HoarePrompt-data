Correctness: **True**

I have reviewed the code and tested it with multiple examples. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the given string is "s-palindrome" by iterating through the string and comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string. If at least one character pair doesn't match, it returns False, indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that the string is an "s-palindrome".

The code handles all potential cases as it follows the problem description accurately.
