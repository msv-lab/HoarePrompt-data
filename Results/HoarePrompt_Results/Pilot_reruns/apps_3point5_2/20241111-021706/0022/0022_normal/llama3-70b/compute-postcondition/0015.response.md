According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is terminated. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than the updated `n // 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
