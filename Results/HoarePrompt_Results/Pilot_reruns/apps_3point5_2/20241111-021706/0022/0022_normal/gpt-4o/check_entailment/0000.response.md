Correctness: **False**

The code is not correct. The function `func_1` only checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal by iterating up to the middle of the string. However, it does not take into account the requirement that the second half of the string must be a mirror reflection of the first half. For example, the string "oXoxoXo" should return "TAK" as it is symmetric about the middle of the string, but the code does not handle this case correctly. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
