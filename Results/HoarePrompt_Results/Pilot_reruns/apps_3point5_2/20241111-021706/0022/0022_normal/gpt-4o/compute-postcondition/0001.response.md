According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, s is a string consisting of only English letters, and |s| is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, implies that n is the length of string s. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, n needs to be greater than or equal to 2, and i is 0.
State: **s is a string consisting of only English letters, |s| is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, n is greater than or equal to 2, i is 0**
