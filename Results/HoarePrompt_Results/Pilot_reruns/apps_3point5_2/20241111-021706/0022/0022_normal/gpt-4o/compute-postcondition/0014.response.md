Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters. It checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal by iterating up to the middle of the string. If any pair of characters doesn't match, it returns False. If the string is empty, consists of the same character throughout, or has an odd length where the middle character is not checked, the function handles these cases. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it correctly identifies the string as a palindrome and returns True. **
