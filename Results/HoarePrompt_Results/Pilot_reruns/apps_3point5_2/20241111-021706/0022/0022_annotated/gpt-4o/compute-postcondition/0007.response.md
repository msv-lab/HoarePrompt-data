According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an even integer between 4 and 1002. If the characters at position `i` and `n - 1 - i` in `s` are not equal, the function returns False. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `n // 2`. Since `n` is an even integer, the last iteration would have `i` equal to `n // 2 - 1`, so to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n // 2 - 1`.

State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an even integer between 4 and 1002, `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1`**
