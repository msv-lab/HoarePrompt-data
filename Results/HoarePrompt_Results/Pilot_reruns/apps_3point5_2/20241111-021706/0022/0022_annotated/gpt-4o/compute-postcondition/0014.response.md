Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 and an even integer `n` between 2 and 1000. It iterates through the string to check if the characters at symmetric positions within the string match. If a mismatch is found, the function returns False. If `n` is odd, the loop does not execute. Therefore, the function checks for symmetry in the string `s` and returns True if it is symmetric, otherwise it returns False.**
