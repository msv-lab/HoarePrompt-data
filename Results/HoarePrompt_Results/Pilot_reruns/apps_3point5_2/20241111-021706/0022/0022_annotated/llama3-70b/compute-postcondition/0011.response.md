According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 2**
