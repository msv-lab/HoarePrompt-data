Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program checks for palindrome property correctly, covering all possible cases and edge scenarios.***
