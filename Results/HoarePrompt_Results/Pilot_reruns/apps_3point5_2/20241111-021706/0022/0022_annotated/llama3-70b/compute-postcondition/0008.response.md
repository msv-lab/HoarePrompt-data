Example Answer: 
`is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, overriding its previous value of `True`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 1**
