According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1, so `i` can be adjusted to 1 to ensure the loop executes one more time.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 1**
