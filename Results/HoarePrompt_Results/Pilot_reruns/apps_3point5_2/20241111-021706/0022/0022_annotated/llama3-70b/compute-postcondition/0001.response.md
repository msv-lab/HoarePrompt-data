Example Answer:
The length of the string `s` is calculated and stored in variable `n`. The value of `n` is the length of the string `s`, which can be between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of the string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of the string `s`**
