Example Answer:
A set `t_set` is created from the string `t`. The set `t_set` will contain unique characters from the string `t`. The previous values of `t` and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: `s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`.
Output State: **Precondition: `s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`**
