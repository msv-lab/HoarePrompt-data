Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number `n`, `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, then the code yields the `candidate` value. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
