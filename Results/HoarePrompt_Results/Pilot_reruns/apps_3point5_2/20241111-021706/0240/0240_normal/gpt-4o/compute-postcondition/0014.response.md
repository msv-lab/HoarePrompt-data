The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars`, which is a string representing the shuffled digits of a number, and `sub`, which is a string representing the remembered substring of the number. The function returns the possible numbers that can be formed by inserting the remembered substring `sub` into the shuffled digits `chars`. The returned value is a list of integers representing these possible numbers. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `chars` and `sub`, and returns a list of possible numbers formed by inserting the remembered substring `sub` into the shuffled digits `chars`.**
