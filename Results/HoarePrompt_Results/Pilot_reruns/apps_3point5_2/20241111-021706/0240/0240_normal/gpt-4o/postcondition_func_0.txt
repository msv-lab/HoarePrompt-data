The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `s` and `sub`, where `s` is a string representing a very large integer and `sub` is a substring of `s` that may contain leading zeroes. The function then updates the character counts in `s_counter` based on `sub_counter` and returns the smallest number generated from the remaining characters in `s_counter`. The function ensures that `s` remains unchanged, `sub` remains the same, `n_len` remains the same, `s_counter` is updated with counts adjusted by `sub_counter`, `sub_counter` remains the same, and the smallest number is returned.
