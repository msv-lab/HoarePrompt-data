Example Answer:
The code yields the `candidate` value. No information is given about the initial state of the `candidate` variable, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string representing the shuffled digits of the number n, `sub` is a string representing the remembered substring of n.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing the shuffled digits of the number n, `sub` is a string representing the remembered substring of n**
