According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more permutations of the characters in the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number `n`, and `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`. To execute the loop one more time, the `chars` string should represent the next permutation after the current one. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation after the current one of the digits of the number `n`, `sub` remains the same as the remembered substring of `n`**
