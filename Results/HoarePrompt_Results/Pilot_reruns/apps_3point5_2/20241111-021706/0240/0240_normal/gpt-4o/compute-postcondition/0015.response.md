Functionality: **The function generate_possible_numbers accepts two parameters, `chars` and `sub`, and iterates through permutations of `chars`. For each permutation, it concatenates the characters to form a candidate number. If the candidate number passes the validation check done by the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, the candidate number is yielded. The function returns a list of possible numbers that meet the validation criteria. If `chars` is an empty string, the function does not yield any candidate numbers.**
