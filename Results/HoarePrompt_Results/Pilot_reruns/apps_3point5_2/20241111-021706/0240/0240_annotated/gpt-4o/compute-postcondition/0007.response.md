Postcondition: ***`chars`, `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration and `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`. If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
