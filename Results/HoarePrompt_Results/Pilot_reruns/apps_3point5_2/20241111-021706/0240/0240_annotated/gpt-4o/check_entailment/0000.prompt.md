You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    #State of the program here: Precondition: `s` and `sub` are strings; `n_len` is the result of calculating the length difference between `s` and `sub`.
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    #State of the program here: `s_counter` is a Counter object based on the string `s`, `n_len` is the result of calculating the length difference between `s` and `sub`
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    #State of the program here: `s_counter` is a Counter object based on the string `s`, `n_len` is the result of calculating the length difference between `s` and `sub`
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `s_counter` is a Counter object based on the string `s` where each character count has been decremented by the corresponding count in `sub_counter`. If `sub_counter` is empty, the loop does not execute and no changes are made to `s_counter`.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    #State of the program here: After the loop executes, `s_counter` is a Counter object based on the string `s` where each character count has been decremented by the corresponding count in `sub_counter`
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    #State of the program here: After the loop executes, `s_counter` is a Counter object based on the string `s` where each character count has been decremented by the corresponding count in `sub_counter`, and `possible_numbers` might hold a list of generated possible numbers
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    #State of the program here: After the loop executes, `s_counter` is a Counter object based on the string `s` where each character count has been decremented by the corresponding count in `sub_counter`, and `possible_numbers` might hold a list of generated possible numbers; `smallest_number` holds the smallest number from the list
    return smallest_number
    #State of the program after the return statement: After the loop executes, `s_counter` is a Counter object based on the string `s` where each character count has been decremented by the corresponding count in `sub_counter`, and `possible_numbers` might hold a list of generated possible numbers; `smallest_number` holds the smallest number from the list, and the function returns the smallest_number
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and sub. It decrements character counts from s based on sub_counter, generates possible numbers from the remaining characters, finds the smallest number from possible_numbers, and returns it. If sub_counter is empty, the function returns the smallest number directly from s.

#Function 2:
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #State of the program after the return statement: num_str is a string representing a very large integer with no leading zeroes except for zero itself, sub is a non-empty substring of num_str, n_len is the length of num_str which is a non-negative integer not exceeding 1,000,000, and the return value is either True or False based on the conditions met.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters, num_str and sub. It checks if the substring sub is present in the num_str and if the length of num_str is equal to n_len. The function returns True if both conditions are met, otherwise it returns False. However, the code does not handle cases where n_len is not equal to the actual length of num_str, which could lead to incorrect results.

#Function 3:
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop generates permutations of the characters in `chars` and checks if each permutation is a valid number using the `is_valid_number` function with the `sub` substring. If the condition is met, the loop yields the candidate. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not a valid substring of `chars`, the loop will not execute, and no changes will occur to the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters, `chars` and `sub`, where `chars` is a string representing the digits of a large integer and `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`. The function generates permutations of the characters in `chars` and checks if each permutation, when combined into a string, is a valid number using the `is_valid_number` function with the `sub` substring. If a permutation satisfies the condition, it yields the candidate. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not a valid substring of `chars`, the function will not yield any candidates. The function does not have a specified return value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
