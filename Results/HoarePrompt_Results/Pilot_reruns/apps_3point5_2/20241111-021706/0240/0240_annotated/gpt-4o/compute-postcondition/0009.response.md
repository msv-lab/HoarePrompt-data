Example Answer:
The string representation of the new permutation `perm` is joined together to form the `candidate` string. The state of `chars` and `perm` is adjusted for the next permutation. The function yields `candidate` only if `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true.
Output State: **`chars`, `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, `candidate` is the joined string of the new `perm`**
