Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect because it does not handle the case where leading zeroes are present in the substring `t`. According to the problem description, the substring `t` can contain leading zeroes. However, the code does not account for this as it directly appends `t` to the final number `n` without considering the possibility of leading zeroes.

For example, if the input is:
```
s = "003512"
t = "021"
```
The correct output should be `"30021"`, but the code will output `300210` because it does not handle the leading zero in the substring `t`.
