Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned an empty string. The variables `s`, `t`, and `t_set` are not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`.
Output State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`**
