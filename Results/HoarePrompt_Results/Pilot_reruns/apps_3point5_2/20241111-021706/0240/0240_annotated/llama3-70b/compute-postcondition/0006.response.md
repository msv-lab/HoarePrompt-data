Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, so the new value of `n` will be the original value of `n` followed by the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`**.
