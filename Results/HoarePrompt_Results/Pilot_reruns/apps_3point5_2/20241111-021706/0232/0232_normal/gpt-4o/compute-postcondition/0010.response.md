According to the code, the loop can execute again if all values in `current_counts` for the keys in `desired_counts` are not equal. At the end of the last iteration, the values in `current_counts` for corresponding keys in `desired_counts` are NOT equal, but the loop condition is checking for when they are equal. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the condition needs to be changed to check when they are not equal. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 1 to `m`, values from list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the values in `current_counts` for corresponding keys in `desired_counts` are NOT equal.**
