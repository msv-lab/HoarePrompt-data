Example Answer:
The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. Since the other variables are not affected by this assignment, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to `m` and values are taken from the list `k`; `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0**
