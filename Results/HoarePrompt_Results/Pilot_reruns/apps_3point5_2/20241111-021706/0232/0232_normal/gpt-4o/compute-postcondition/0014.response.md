Output State: **If all values in `current_counts` for corresponding keys in `desired_counts` are equal, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, `desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 1 to `m` and values from list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is greater than 0. The loop will continue to execute until the condition is met or n is less than or equal to 0.**
