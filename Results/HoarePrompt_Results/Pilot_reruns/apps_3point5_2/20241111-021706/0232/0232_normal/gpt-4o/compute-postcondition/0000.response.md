Example Answer:
The `desired_counts` dictionary is created by zipping the range from 1 to `m` with the values in the list `k`. The previous values of `m` and `k` are known, and `range(1, m + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to `m`. Therefore, the `desired_counts` dictionary is created based on the values in list `k`.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to `m` and values are taken from the list `k`**
