Postcondition: ***'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color, 'found' is True if all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding target counts in 'counts', 'j' is equal to 'i', 'color' is assigned a color value from the 'colors' list, 'color_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'window_counts' is a dictionary with 'color' key and value 1 if 'color' was not already in 'window_counts', 'i' is incremented by 1, 'i' is less than 'n', 'j' is equal to 'i', 'n' is greater than or equal to 'i', 'color' is assigned the color at index 'j' from the 'colors' list. If all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding target counts in 'counts', 'found' is set to True and the loop breaks.***
