Example Answer:
`window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `window_counts[color]` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n', and `window_counts[color]` is 0.
Output State: **color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n', `window_counts[color]` is 0**
