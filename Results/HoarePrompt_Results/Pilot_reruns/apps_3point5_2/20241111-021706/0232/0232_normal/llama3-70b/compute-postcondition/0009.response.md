Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is assigned 0 for the specific color. The dictionary `color_counts` is updated for the processed color, and `color` is a color from the list of colors. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color, initially set to 0 for all colors and updated for the colors processed, `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color, initially set to 0 for all colors and updated for the colors processed, `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color**
