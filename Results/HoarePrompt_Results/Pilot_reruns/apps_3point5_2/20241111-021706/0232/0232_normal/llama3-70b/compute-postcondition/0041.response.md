Example Answer:
`window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n', and `window_counts[color]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1.
Output State: **color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n', and `window_counts[color]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1**
