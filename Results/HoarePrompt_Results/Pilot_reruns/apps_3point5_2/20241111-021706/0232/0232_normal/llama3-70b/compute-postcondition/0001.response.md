Example Answer:
The list `colors` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split into multiple values, and each value is converted to an integer. The values are then stored in the list `colors`. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers**
