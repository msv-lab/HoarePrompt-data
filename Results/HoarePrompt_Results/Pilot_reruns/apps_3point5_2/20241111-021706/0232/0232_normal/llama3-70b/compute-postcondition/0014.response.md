Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color including the next color with a value of 0, `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color. If the color is not already in `color_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. All other variables and data structures remain unchanged.***
