Postcondition: ***'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color, 'found' remains True if all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding target counts in 'counts', 'j' is equal to the new value of 'i', 'color' is assigned a color value from the 'colors' list, 'color_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'window_counts' is a dictionary with 'color' key and value equal to 0 if 'color' was not in 'window_counts' before the execution, or remains 1 if 'color' was already present, 'i' is incremented by 1, 'i' is less than 'n', 'window_counts[color]' is increased by 1. The postcondition ensures that the state of the program variables is preserved after the if statement is executed, accounting for all possible edge cases regarding the 'color' key in 'window_counts'.***
