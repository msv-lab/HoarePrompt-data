Postcondition: ***'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color, 'found' is either True or False, 'j' is an integer within the range of 'i' and 'n', 'color' is assigned a color value from the 'colors' list, 'color_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'window_counts' is a dictionary with 'color' key and value 1, 'i' is incremented by 1, 'i' is less than 'n', 'j' is equal to 'i'. If 'color' is not in 'window_counts', 'window_counts' is updated with 'color' key and value 0. If all the counts in 'window_counts' are equal to the corresponding targets in 'counts', then 'found' is set to True and the loop breaks. This condition covers all possible scenarios and the program maintains the integrity of the initial state of the variables.***
