Postcondition: ***color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n', window_counts[color] is either incremented by 1 or set to 1. If all counts in window_counts match the corresponding targets in counts after sorting, found is set to True, and the loop breaks. This covers all cases where the condition is met, ensuring the program exits the loop when the specified condition is satisfied.***
