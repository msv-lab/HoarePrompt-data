Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is set to 0, where `color` is a color from the `colors` list. The dictionary `color_counts` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color and values set to 0, `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color and values set to 0, `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color**
