The function `func` reads input values for the number of Jedi Knights and the number of possible colors of lightsabers, as well as the lists of colors and their counts. It then iterates through the colors and their counts to determine if a specific distribution of lightsabers can be achieved among the Jedi Knights. The function prints 'YES' if the distribution is possible and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not explicitly return any value but modifies the distribution of lightsabers among the Jedi Knights based on the provided constraints. The code handles cases where the number of Jedi Knights is zero, the colors list is empty, or the counts do not match the targets.
