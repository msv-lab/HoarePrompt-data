Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is updated to 0, where `color` is a key in the dictionary `color_counts`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `colors` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color including the next color with a value of 0, `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color including the next color with a value of 0, `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color**
