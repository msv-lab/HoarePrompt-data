Example Answer:
The variable 'color' is assigned the value of 'colors[j]'. Since 'j' is less than 'n', 'color' will be assigned a color value from the 'colors' list at index 'j'. The states of 'window_counts', 'counts', and 'found' remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n'.
Output State: **color is assigned a color value, 'j' is less than 'n'**
