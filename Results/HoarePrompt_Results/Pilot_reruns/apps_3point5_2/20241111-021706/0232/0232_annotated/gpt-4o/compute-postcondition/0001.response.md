Example Answer:
`current_counts` is initialized as a defaultdict with default value 0. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to corresponding values in list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with default value 0.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to corresponding values in list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with default value 0**
