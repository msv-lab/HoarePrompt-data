Example Answer:
The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to corresponding values in list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with default value 0, left is 0.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to corresponding values in list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with default value 0, left is 0**
