Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in the `colors` list is incremented by 1 in the `current_counts` dictionary. This means that the count of that color is now closer to the desired count specified in `desired_counts`. The other counts remain the same. 
Output State: **All current counts are equal to their corresponding desired counts for all colors in the desired counts dictionary, except for the count of the color at index `right` in the `colors` list which is now one less than the desired count.**
