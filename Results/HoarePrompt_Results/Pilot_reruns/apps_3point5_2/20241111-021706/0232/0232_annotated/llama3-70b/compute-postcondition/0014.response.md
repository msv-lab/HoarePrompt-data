Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers based on the input with at least one more color, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split. If `color` is not already in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` is updated to include `color` with a count of 0. Otherwise, the existing count of `color` in `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
