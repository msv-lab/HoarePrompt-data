According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` should start from `i` and go up to `n-1`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` starts from `i` and goes up to `n-1`**
