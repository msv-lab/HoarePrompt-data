Functionality: **The function `func` reads input, processes it, and then determines whether a specific condition is met or not. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not accept any explicit parameters but operates based on the input provided. The function loops through the input data to check for a specific pattern. It updates dictionaries and flags based on the conditions met during the loop. The final output is determined by whether the condition is met after the loop execution. If the input data does not meet the expected structure, the function may not behave as intended.**
