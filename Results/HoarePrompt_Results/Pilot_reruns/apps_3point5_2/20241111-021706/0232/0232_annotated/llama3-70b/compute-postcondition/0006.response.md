Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, a key-value pair is added to `color_counts` with the color as the key and the value set to 0. All input lists and the dictionary remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
