According to the code, the loop execution depends on the `colors` list. If the `colors` list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `colors` is a list of integers based on the input, so it already meets the criteria for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
