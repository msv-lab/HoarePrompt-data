Postcondition: ***`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `found` is either True or False, `window_counts` contains the pairs `color: 1` and `color: 0`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in `colors`. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `found` remains False.***
