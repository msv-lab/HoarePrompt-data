Example Answer:
`color` is assigned the value at index `j` from the `colors` list. The value of `j` is unknown, so the exact value of `color` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `counts` is not empty, `window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
Output State: **`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `counts` is not empty, `window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair**
