Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values and checks if there exists a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights with the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. It does this by using a sliding window approach and checking if the current counts of each color match the desired counts. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval exists, otherwise it returns 'NO'. 

The implementation seems to follow the problem description accurately and the logic used in the program is correct. The sliding window approach efficiently handles the task of finding the desired counts of lightsabers within a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights. Additionally, the program checks all potential cases and returns the correct output based on the requirements of the problem.
