Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved. The program then outputs "YES" if such an interval exists and "NO" otherwise. The program seems to cover all potential cases as per the problem description, and there are no obvious scenarios where it would fail.
