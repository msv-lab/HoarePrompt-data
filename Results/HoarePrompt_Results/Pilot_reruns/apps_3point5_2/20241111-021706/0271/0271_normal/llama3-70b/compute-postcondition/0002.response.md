Example Answer:
`n` is subtracted by `n % 10`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the result of `n % 10` will be between 0 and 9. Therefore, the result of `n - n % 10` will be the original number minus the ones digit of the number. For example, if `n` is 47, then `n - n % 10` will be 47 - 7 = 40. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is a multiple of 10.
Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is a multiple of 10**
