Functionality: ** The function `func` takes user input of a non-negative integer `n` and then based on the value of `n % 10`, it performs different calculations and prints the result. If `n % 10` is 0, it prints `n`. If `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, it prints a multiple of 10 obtained by subtracting `n % 10` from `n`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, it prints a value between `n+1` and `n+10` by adding `10 - n % 10` to `n`. The function does not have a specific return value. **
