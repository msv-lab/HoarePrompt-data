Example Answer:
The value of `n` is added to the result of `(10 - n % 10)`. The modulo operation `%` returns the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the value of `(10 - n % 10)` will always be between 1 and 10. Therefore, when `n` is added to this value, the result will be between `n+1` and `n+10`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the result of the expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` is between `n+1` and `n+10`**
