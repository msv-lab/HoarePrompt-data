Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes an integer input `n` from the user.
- If `n % 10 == 0`, it prints `n`, which aligns with the case where the number already ends with a 0.
- If `n % 10 <= 5`, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting `n % 10` from `n`.
- If `n % 10 > 5`, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding the difference between 10 and `n % 10` to `n`.
- The code covers all possible scenarios described in the problem statement, and the outputs seem to match the expected results. 
- The output hints also support the correctness of the code by explaining the different rounding logic based on the value of `n % 10`.
