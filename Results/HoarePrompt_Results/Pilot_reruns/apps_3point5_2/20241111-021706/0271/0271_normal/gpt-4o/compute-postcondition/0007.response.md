Functionality: **The function `func` reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, then based on the value of the remainder, it calculates `result` either as the subtraction of `n` and `remainder` if `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, or as the addition of `n` and (10 - `remainder`) if `remainder` is greater than 5. Finally, it prints the value of `result`. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the output is displayed directly to the console.**
