Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, the value of `result` will be `n + (10 - remainder)`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, `result` is the sum of `n` and `10 - remainder`**
