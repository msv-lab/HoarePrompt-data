Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the value of `n` after execution will be a non-negative integer obtained from the input. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer**
