Example Answer:
The code calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. The expression `n % 10` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Therefore, `n % 10` will be a value between 0 and 9. 

When we add `(10 - n % 10)` to `n`, it ensures that the result is always the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`. For example, if `n` is 17, then `(10 - n % 10)` will be 3, and the result will be 20. If `n` is 25, then `(10 - n % 10)` will be 5, and the result will be 30.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and after executing the code `n + (10 - n % 10)`, the result is the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the result is the next multiple of 10 greater than or equal to `n`**
