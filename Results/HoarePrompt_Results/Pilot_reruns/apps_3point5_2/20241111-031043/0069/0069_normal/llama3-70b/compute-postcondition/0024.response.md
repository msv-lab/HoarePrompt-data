Example Answer:
`cnt0` is assigned the count of '0's in `s` and `cnt1` is assigned the count of '1's in `s`. The values of `s` are not directly provided, so the output state will be: `T-1` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` and `x` are integers from user input, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` and `x` are assigned values from user input.
Output State: **`T-1` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` and `x` are integers from user input, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` and `x` are assigned values from user input**
