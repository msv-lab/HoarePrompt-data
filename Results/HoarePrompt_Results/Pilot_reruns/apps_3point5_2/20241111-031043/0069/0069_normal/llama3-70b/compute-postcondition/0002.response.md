Example Answer: 
`n` and `x` are assigned values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by space. The input is taken from the user, so the values of `n` and `x` depend on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from user input.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from user input**
