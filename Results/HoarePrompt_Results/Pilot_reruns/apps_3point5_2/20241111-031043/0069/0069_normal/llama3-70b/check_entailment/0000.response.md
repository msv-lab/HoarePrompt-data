Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input correctly, processes each test case as described in the problem statement, and prints the expected output.
- It calculates the balance of the string 's' correctly and then determines the number of prefixes of 't' with balance equal to 'x' based on the given conditions.
- The code handles the case when there is an infinite number of such prefixes by checking if the difference between the desired balance 'x' and the current balance can be evenly divided by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in the string 's'. If so, it prints -1.
- For all other cases, it correctly calculates the number of prefixes satisfying the given conditions and prints the result.
