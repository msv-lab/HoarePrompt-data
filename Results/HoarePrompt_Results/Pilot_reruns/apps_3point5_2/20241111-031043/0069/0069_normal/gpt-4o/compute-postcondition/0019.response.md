Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix balances based on the string `s`, incrementing the balance by 1 if the character is '0' and decrementing by 1 if the character is '1'. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.**
