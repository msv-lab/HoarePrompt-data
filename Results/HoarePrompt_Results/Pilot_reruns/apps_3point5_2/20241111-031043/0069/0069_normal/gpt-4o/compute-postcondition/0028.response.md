Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. If the conditions are met, then `count` will increase by 1, otherwise, no changes occur. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least two zero values, and `count` is increased by 1 if specific conditions are met.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least two zero values, and `count` is increased by 1 if specific conditions are met**
