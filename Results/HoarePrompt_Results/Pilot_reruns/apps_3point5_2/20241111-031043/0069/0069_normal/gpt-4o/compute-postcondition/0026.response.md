Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value. If (x - b) divided by `balance` yields a remainder of 0 and the result is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is increased by 1. No changes occur if the conditions are not met. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios by ensuring the integrity of the initial state and the potential increase in `count` based on the specified conditions.***
