Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with updated values based on the calculation in the code snippet, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index 3, `index` is 5, `balance` is calculated based on the string `s`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `T` is greater than 1. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 0 is appended to `results`. In the scenario where `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. Additionally, `x`, `index`, `balance`, and `s` remain the same, and `i` is equal to 1.***
