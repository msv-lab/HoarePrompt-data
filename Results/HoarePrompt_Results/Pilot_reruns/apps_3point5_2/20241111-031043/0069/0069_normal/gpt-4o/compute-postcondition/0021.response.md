Example Answer: 
A new element with the value 0 is appended to the list `results`. The loop calculating prefix balances and the conditions based on `n` are not affected by this append operation. Therefore, the Output State is: the loop calculates the prefix balances based on the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, with a new element 0 appended to `results`.
Output State: **the loop calculates the prefix balances based on the string `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, a new element 0 is appended to `results`**
