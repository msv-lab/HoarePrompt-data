Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of the length of a binary string `s`, the desired balance `x`, and the binary string `s` itself.
- It correctly calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` and creates a list of prefix balances based on the binary string `s`.
- The code then accurately determines the number of prefixes with a balance equal to `x` by iterating through the prefix balances and counting the valid cases.
- The results are stored in a list and printed after all test cases are processed.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it accurately calculates the number of prefixes with the desired balance `x`.
