Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is the index from which a value is extracted and converted to an integer. We ensure `n` is greater than 0. The list `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with at least one zero value. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value**
