Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value, `count` is increased by 1**
