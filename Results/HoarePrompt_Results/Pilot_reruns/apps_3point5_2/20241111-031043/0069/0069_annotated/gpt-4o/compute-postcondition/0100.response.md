Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the state of the program is as follows: `prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1`, `balance` is calculated based on the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `T` is greater than 1, `s` is assigned the value obtained from `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `balance` is 0, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`; otherwise, 0 is appended to `results`. In the else part, `count` represents the total number of times the condition is satisfied for each element in `prefix_balances` list, and this count is appended to the `results` list.***
