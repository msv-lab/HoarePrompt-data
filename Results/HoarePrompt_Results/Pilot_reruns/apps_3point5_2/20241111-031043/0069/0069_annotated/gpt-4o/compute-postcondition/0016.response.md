According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. To adjust the states for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's in `s` and subtracting the count of '1's, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous values of `prefix_balances`, `s`, and `i` where `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
