Example Answer:
The value of `index` is increased by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` represents the updated number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions specified in the loop, `n` is the value obtained from `int(data[index])`, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[index + 1]`.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` represents the updated number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions specified in the loop, `n` is the value obtained from `int(data[index])`, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[index + 1]`**
