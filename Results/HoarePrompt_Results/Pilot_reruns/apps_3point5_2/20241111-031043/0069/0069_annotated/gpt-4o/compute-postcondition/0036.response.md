Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the binary string `s`, where each element in `prefix_balances` is the sum of the corresponding elements in `s` up to that point. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros with length 1. If `balance` is equal to 0, then if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, the `results` list contains -1. Otherwise, the `results` list contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions specified in the loop. The `results` list contains the appended `count` value.***
