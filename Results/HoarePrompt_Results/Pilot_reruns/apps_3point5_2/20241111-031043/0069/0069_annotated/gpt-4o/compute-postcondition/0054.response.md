Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` appends -1. Otherwise, `results` appends 0.***
