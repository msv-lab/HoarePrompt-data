Example Answer:
n and x are assigned values from the input using map(int, input().split()). The variables cnt0, cnt1, and balance are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: T-1, n, x, s are positive integers. s is a binary string of length n. n and x are assigned values from the input. cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s. balance is cnt0 - cnt1.
Output State: **T-1, n, x, s are positive integers. s is a binary string of length n. n and x are assigned values from the input. cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s. balance is cnt0 - cnt1**
