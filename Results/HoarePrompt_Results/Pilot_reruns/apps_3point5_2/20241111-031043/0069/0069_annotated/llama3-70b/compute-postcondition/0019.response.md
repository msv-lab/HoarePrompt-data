Postcondition: ***T, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1 are positive integers, s is a binary string of length n, n and x are assigned values from input, cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s, balance is cnt0 - cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed.***
