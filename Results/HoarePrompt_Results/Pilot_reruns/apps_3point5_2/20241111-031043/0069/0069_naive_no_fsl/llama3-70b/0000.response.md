Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the given string and then checks if the balance matches the desired balance $x$. If it matches, it prints the length of the string + 1. If the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the calculated balance can be evenly divided by the difference between the counts of 0 and 1 in the string, it prints -1 indicating an infinite number of prefixes. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes required to achieve the desired balance and prints that value. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
