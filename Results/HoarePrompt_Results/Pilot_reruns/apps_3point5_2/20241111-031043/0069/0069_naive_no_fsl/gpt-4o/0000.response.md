Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where there can be an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. The program incorrectly assumes that if the desired balance is 0 and the balance of the given string is also 0, then there will be either 0 or infinite prefixes, which is not always true.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 0
00
```
The program will output 0, but the correct output should be -1, as there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance 0 in the infinite string built from the given string '00'. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness of the program False.
