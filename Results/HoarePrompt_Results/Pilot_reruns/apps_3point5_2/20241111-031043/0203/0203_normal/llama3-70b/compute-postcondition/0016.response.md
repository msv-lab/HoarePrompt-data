According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the `fractions` list has at least 3 fractions. At the end of the last iteration, the `fractions` list has at least 2 fractions. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `fractions` list must have at least 3 fractions.
State: **`n` is an input integer, if `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains 0, and `fractions` list has at least 3 fractions. If `fraction` is 'R', then `depublicans` remains 0, `remocrats` is increased by 1, and `fractions` list has at least 3 fractions.**
