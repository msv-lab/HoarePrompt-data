Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is either updated with the addition of `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, or `r_queue` is updated with the addition of `r_index + n` if `d_index` is not less than `r_index`. In either case, `r_queue` is one element shorter if the if part is executed, and `r_queue` is one element longer if the else part is executed. Additionally, `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`, and `r_index` holds the value that was popped from the front of `r_queue` after the execution of the if else block. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the value of `d_index`. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is empty.***
