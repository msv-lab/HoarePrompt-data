According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`. For the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to be non-empty.
State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty**
