According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `votes` string. If the string has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are empty lists. So for the loop to be executed, the `votes` string must have at least 1 character, and `i` is 0 and `v` is the first character in the `votes` string.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string**
