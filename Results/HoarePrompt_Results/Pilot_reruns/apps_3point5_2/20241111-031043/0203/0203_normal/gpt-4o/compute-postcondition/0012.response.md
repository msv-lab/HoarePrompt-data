According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the `votes` string. If the string has at least 3 characters remaining, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 2 characters remaining. If the second character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [1] and `r_queue` is a list. If the second character of `votes` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the value 1 and `d_queue` is a list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `votes` string must have at least 3 characters remaining. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 3 characters remaining.
