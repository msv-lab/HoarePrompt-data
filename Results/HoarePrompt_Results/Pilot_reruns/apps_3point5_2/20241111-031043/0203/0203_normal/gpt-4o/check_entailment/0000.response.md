Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the voting procedure as described in the problem statement. It organizes the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters into separate queues, and then iterates through the queues according to the rules of the voting process. The code handles cases where employees are denied the right to vote, and correctly determines the winning party based on the majority of votes. The output of the code aligns with the expected outcome of the vote based on the provided input. 

The output hints also agree with the code. The code determines the winning party based on the majority of votes, either 'D' for depublicans or 'R' for remocrats. The hints provide a clear explanation of how the code operates, and they are consistent with the actual implementation of the code. 

Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, we can conclude that the program is correct and provides the expected outcome for all potential cases.
