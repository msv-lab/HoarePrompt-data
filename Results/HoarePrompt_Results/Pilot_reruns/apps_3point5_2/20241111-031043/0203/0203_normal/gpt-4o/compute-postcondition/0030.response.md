Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, which means `d_index` takes the value of the first element in `d_queue`. The size of `d_queue` decreases by 1 due to the pop operation. The states of `r_queue`, `d_queue`, `r_index`, and `n` are not affected. 
Output State: **`d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter**
