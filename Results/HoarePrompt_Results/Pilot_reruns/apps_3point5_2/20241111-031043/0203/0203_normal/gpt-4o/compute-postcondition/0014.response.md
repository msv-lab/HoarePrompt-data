Example Answer:
`i` is appended to `r_queue`. The value of `i` is unknown, but `r_queue` is a list. Therefore, after execution, `r_queue` will contain the value of `i` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 3 characters remaining. If the second character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [1] and `r_queue` is a list containing the appended value of `i`. If the second character of `votes` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the value 1 and `d_queue` is a list**
