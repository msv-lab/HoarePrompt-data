Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 3 characters remaining. If the second character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [1, i] and `r_queue` is a list. If the second character of `votes` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the value 1 and `d_queue` is a list. In both cases, the program appends the value of `i` to the appropriate queue depending on the condition.***
