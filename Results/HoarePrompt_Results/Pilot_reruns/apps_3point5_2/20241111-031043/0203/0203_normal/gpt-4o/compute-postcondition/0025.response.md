Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` is not empty. The value popped from `r_queue` is stored in `r_index`. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is one element shorter, `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the value that was popped from the front of `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is one element shorter, `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the value that was popped from the front of `r_queue`**
