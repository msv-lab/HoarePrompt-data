The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `votes` consisting of 'D' and 'R'. It then organizes the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters into separate queues. The function iterates through the queues, updating the indices based on certain conditions. Finally, it determines the winning party based on the majority of votes. If there are more 'D' votes, 'D' is printed; if there are more 'R' votes, 'R' is printed. If the votes are equal, it prints 'Tie'. The function does not accept any parameters, but operates under constraints regarding the input values of `n` and `votes`.
