Output State: **If both d_queue and r_queue are not empty, the loop will continue to iterate through the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in votes. After each iteration, either d_queue will be updated with the addition of d_index + n if d_index is less than r_index, or r_queue will be updated with the addition of r_index + n if d_index is not less than r_index. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue will contain the updated value of d_index and r_queue will remain the same. If d_index is not less than r_index, d_queue will be empty and r_queue will contain the updated value of r_index + n. The loop will end when either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty.**
