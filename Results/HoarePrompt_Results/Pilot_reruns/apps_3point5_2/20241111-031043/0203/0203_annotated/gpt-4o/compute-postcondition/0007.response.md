Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes. If the first character in the `votes` string is 'D', then `d_queue` contains [0] and `r_queue` is empty. Otherwise, if the first character in the `votes` string is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains [0] and `d_queue` is empty. In both cases, `i` is 0 and `v` is the first character in the `votes` string.***
