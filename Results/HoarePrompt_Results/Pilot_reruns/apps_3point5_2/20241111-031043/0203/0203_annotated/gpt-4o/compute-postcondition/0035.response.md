According to the code, the loop can execute if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `d_queue` is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` contains the popped element from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is not empty, and `r_queue` contains the popped element either incremented by `n` if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, or containing `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`**
