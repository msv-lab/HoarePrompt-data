Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` contains the popped element from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now empty, and `r_queue` contains the popped element either incremented by `n` if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, or containing `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`.***
