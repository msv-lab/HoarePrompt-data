Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The state of the `r_queue` is affected by removing the first element. The values of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, and the state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the initial input**
