Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` is not empty, the first element is removed and assigned to `d_index`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` contains the popped element from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is not empty.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` contains the popped element from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is not empty**
