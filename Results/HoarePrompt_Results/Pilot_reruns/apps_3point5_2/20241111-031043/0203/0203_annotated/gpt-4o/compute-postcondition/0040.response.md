The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the winning party based on the majority of votes represented in the input string. The input string `votes` contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R' representing the fraction of each employee (depublicans or remocrats). The function will determine the winning party based on which party has the majority of votes. If the number of 'D's is greater than the number of 'R's, the function will return "Depublicans win". If the number of 'R's is greater than the number of 'D's, the function will return "Remocrats win". If there is a tie, the function will return "Tie". 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the winning party based on the majority of votes between 'D' (Depublicans) and 'R' (Remocrats) in the input string votes.**
