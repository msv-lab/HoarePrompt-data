Example Answer:
`r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the input string representing the votes, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the input string representing the votes, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list**
