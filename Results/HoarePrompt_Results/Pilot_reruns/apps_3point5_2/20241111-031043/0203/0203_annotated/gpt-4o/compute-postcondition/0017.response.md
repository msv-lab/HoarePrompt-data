Output State: 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees.
- `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes.
- If all characters in `votes` are 'D', then `d_queue` contains all indices from 0 to the length of `votes` - 1, and `r_queue` is empty.
- If all characters in `votes` are 'R', then `r_queue` contains all indices from 0 to the length of `votes` - 1, and `d_queue` is empty.
- If `votes` contains a mix of 'D' and 'R' characters, then `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' votes in the order they appear in `votes`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' votes in the order they appear in `votes`.

In cases where `votes` is an empty string, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty.
