Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`. The final state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index` after the execution of the if-else block, covering all possible edge cases.***
