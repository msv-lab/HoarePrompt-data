Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains a non-empty input string representing the votes, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, and the state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the initial input. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` will have the appended value of `d_index + n`. Otherwise, if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` will have the appended value of `r_index + n`. The final state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be determined based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index` after the execution of the if-else block.***
