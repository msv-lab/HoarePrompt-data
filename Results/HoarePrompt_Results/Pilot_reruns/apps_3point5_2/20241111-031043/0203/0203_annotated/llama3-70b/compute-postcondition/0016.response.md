According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions string. If there are more fractions to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, and fractions is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction to iterate over. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, if the next fraction is 'D', then depublicans should be incremented by 1. Otherwise, remocrats should be incremented by 1.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction to iterate over. If the next fraction is 'D', then depublicans is incremented by 1. Otherwise, remocrats is incremented by 1.**
