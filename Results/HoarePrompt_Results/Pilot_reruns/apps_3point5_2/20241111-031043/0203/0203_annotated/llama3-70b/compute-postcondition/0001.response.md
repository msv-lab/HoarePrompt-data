Example Answer:
The input function `input()` accepts input and assigns it to the variable `fractions`. The value of `n` is still unknown and unaffected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a string input.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a string input**
