Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly checks if all the remainders of dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far and if it encounters a duplicate remainder, it immediately prints "No" and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" at the end, indicating that all remainders are distinct. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and works correctly.
