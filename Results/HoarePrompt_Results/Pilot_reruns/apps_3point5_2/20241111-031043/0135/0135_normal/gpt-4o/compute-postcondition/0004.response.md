Example Answer: 
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not given, so the output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i**`
