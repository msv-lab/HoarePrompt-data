Example Answer:
`remainder` is added to the set `seen`. If `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. The values of `n`, `k`, `i` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 to 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 to 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`**
