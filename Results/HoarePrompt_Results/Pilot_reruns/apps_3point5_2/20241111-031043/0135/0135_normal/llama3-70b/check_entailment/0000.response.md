Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder repeats, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This logic exactly follows the problem description. The code correctly handles cases where `k` is less than 1 by not executing the loop. The output hints also align with the code's functionality. The hints describe the same logic of checking for distinct remainders and printing 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, we can confidently say that the code is correct for all potential cases.
