Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are known integers. Therefore, the value of `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. 
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `seen` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k + 1**
