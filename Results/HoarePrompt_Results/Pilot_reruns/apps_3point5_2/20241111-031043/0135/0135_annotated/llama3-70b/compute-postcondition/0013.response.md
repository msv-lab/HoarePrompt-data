Example Answer: 
The `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. If `remainder` was not already in `seen`, it is now added. This ensures that duplicate remainders are detected. The program does not exit in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, and `seen` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k + 1.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `seen` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k + 1**
