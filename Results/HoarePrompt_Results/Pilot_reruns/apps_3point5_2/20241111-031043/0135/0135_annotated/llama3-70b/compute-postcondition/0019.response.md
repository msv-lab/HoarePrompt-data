Example Answer:
`remainder` is added to the set `seen`. If `remainder` is already in `seen`, 'No' is printed to the console and the program exits. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, unless 'No' is printed and the program exits if `remainder` is already in `seen`.**
