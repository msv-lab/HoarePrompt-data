Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. If the remainder is in the set of seen remainders during the loop, the function returns 'No'. After the loop executes: If the loop does not execute (k is greater than or equal to n), the state remains unchanged. If the loop executes at least once (k is less than n), `i` is equal to k, and the remainder is the result of n % k. Subsequent iterations update `i` to the next value and compute the remainder as n % i.**
