Example Answer:
The remainder is calculated by performing n % i, where n and i are integers. Since i is equal to k, the remainder will be n % k. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `i` is equal to k, and the remainder is the result of n % k.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `i` is equal to k, and the remainder is the result of n % k**
