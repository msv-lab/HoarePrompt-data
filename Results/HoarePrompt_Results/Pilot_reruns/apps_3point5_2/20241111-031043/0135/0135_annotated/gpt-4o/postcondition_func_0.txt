The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, both within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
The function checks if k is greater than or equal to n; if true, it returns 'No'. 
If k is less than n, the function iterates through the range from 1 to k inclusive, calculating the remainder of n divided by each number. 
If any remainder is already in the set of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. 
If no repeated remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes' after completing the loop. 
However, the code does not handle the case where k equals 0, which could potentially lead to a division by zero error.
