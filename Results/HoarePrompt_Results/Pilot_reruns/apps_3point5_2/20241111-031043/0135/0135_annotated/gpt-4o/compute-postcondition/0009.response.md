According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `k+1`.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `i` is equal to k+1, and the remainder is the result of n % k**
