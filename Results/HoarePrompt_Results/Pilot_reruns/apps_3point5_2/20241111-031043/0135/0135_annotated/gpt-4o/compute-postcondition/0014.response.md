The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.

Case_2: 
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.
- If the remainder is in the set of seen remainders during the loop, the function returns 'No'.
- After the loop executes:
  - If the loop does not execute (k is greater than or equal to n), the state remains unchanged.
  - If the loop executes at least once (k is less than n), `i` is equal to k, and the remainder is the result of n % k.
  - Subsequent iterations update `i` to the next value and compute the remainder as n % i.

Case_3: 
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.
- If the remainder is in the set of seen remainders during the loop, the function returns 'No'.
- After the loop executes: 
  - If the loop does not execute (k is greater than or equal to n), the state remains unchanged.
  - If the loop executes at least once (k is less than n), `i` is equal to k, and the remainder is the result of n % k.
  - Subsequent iterations update `i` to the next value and compute the remainder as n % i.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, both within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and perform the described operations based on the conditions stated in each case.
