Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes two integers as input, n and k, and then iterates through the range from 1 to k to calculate the remainder of n divided by i. It then checks if the remainder has been seen before using a set data structure. If the remainder has been seen before, it prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". The logic of the program aligns with the problem description provided. All edge cases are handled appropriately.
