Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders. It covers all potential cases where remainders may not be distinct and returns "No" in those cases. The program also correctly returns "Yes" if all remainders are distinct. Hence, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
