Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers extracted from input split by space. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers**
