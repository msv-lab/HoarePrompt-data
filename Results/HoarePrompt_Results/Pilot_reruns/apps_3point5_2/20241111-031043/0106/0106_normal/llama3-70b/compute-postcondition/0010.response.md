Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated; `b_floor` is calculated; `b_block` is calculated; `min_block_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Otherwise, if `b_floor` is greater than or equal to `a_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. This covers all possible cases based on the relationship between `a_floor` and `b_floor`, ensuring the correct calculation of `min_floor_time` in all scenarios. Finally, `min_block_time + min_floor_time` is printed.**
