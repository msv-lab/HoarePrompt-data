Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now set based on the user input, which must adhere to the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints**
