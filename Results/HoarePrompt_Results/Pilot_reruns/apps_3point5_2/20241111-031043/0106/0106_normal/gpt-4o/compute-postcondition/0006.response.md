Output State: **If floor_a is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - absolute value of (block_a - block_b)) modulo n multiplied by 15.**
