Example Answer:
The function returns `block` and `floor`. No specific calculations or changes are made to the initial state variables. Therefore, the output state is: m, n, k are positive integers such that 1 <= m, n, k <= 1000; a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b.
Output State: **m, n, k are positive integers such that 1 <= m, n, k <= 1000; a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b**
