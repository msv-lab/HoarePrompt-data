Example Answer: 
If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - absolute value of (block_a - block_b)) modulo n multiplied by 15. 
`min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are calculated as described. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
Output State: **If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are calculated. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`**
