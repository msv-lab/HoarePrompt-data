The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The function expects `apartment` to be a positive integer. Precondition: m, n, k are positive integers such that 1 <= m, n, k <= 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept a positive integer `apartment` and ensure that the constraints related to m, n, k, a, and b are met as specified in the precondition.
