The function `func_1` takes five parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, and `a` and `b` are positive integers less than or equal to `n * m * k`. The function calculates the total time required to move from location `a` to location `b` within a specific block structure. It considers the time to exit the starting location, the direct and reverse walking times between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor at location `b`. The function returns the total time based on these calculations.
