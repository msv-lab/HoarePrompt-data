Example Answer:
`time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, where `floor_b` is the target floor. If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0, otherwise, it is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are calculated based on some conditions not provided here. Finally, `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. Therefore, the Output State is: If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are calculated. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.
Output State: **If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0.
