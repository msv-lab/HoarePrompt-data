Example Answer:
The variable `floor_within_block` is calculated by taking the value of `apartment`, subtracting 1 from it, and then finding the remainder of dividing it by the product of `m` and `k`. However, since the initial state does not provide the values of `apartment`, `m`, or `k`, we cannot determine the specific value of `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the Output State is: Not enough information to determine the output state.
Output State: **Not enough information to determine the output state**
