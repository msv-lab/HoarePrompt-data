Output State: **`n, m, k, a, b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then the `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, the `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1 based on the implementation of the `get_location` function and the value of `a`. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
