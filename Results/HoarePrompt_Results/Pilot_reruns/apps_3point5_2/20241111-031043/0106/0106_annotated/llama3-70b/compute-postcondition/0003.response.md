Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided. It takes the input integer `a`, subtracts 1 from it, divides by the product of `m` and `k`, and then adds 1. The variables `a`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, and `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula**
