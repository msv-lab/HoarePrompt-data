Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000**
