Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values by mapping integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `a` and `b` are based on user input and may vary. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers**
