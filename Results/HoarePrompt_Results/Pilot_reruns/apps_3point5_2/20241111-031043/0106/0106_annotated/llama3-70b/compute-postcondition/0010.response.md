Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is an integer, `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated based on the provided formula. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10, and the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` is printed.**
