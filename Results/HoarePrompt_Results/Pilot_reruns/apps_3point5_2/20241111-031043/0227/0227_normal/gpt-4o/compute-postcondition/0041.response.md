Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements left to iterate over, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1. If the loop does not execute at all or if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, and `assigned` now contains the element `a[i]`**
