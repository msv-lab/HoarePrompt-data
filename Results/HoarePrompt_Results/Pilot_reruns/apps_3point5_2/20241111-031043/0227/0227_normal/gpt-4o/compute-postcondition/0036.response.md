Postcondition: ***Given `n` as a positive integer, `a` as a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` with elements left to iterate over, `m` incremented by 1, and `i` increased by 1, where `a[i] - x` is not present in `assigned, if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. No changes occur to the other variables in this if else block.***
