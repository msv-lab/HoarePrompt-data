According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `assigned`. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `i` is 1. If a[i] - x is in assigned, can_form is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, can_form remains False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the assigned list must still not be empty.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is not empty, m is 1, i is 1**
