Example Answer: 
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, sorting it will rearrange the elements in ascending order. The state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) and a is sorted in ascending order.**
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) and a is sorted in ascending order.**
