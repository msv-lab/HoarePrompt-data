Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not completely meet the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that the described sequence of operations can be performed. However, there is an issue with the implementation. 

The code iterates through the list `a` to check if a match exists between the difference of elements and updates the counter `m` accordingly. It uses a set called `assigned` to keep track of the values that have been assigned to variables. 

One potential issue is that the code does not handle the scenario where `assigned` is empty. If the first element in the list `a` cannot be formed by the difference of any previous elements, the code does not increment `m` appropriately. This can lead to an incorrect minimum number of variables required.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The correct output should be `-1` because it is not possible to form the sequence of operations with any number of variables. However, the code may incorrectly return a value greater than `-1` due to the mentioned issue.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
