According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` multiplied by 2, then `m` is increased by 1. In this case, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n-1`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `n` should remain the same and `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
