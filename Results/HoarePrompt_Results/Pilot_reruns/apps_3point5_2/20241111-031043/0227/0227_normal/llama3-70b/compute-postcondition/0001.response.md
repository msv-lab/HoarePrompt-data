Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values are distinct positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9)**
