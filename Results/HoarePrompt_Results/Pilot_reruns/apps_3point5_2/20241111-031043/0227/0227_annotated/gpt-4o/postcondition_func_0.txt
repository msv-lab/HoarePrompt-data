The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. It iterates through the list a to determine if the smallest positive integer in a is in the assigned set. It updates the status of can_form based on this check and increments m accordingly. The function returns the final value of m. If the annotations are accurate, the function seems to correctly implement the described logic.
