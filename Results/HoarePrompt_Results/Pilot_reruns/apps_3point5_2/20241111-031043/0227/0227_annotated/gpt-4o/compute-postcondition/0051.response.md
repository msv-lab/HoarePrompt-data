Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If there exists an element `a[i] - x` in the list `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, `m` remains 0, `assigned` is still a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the second element in the list `assigned`. The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there are no changes in `can_form`, `m`, `assigned`, and `x`.***
