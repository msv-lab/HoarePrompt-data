Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not follow the logic required to determine the minimum number of variables m. The program sorts the input sequence 'a' and then checks if each element can be formed by summing two previously assigned variables. This logic does not guarantee the minimum number of variables required.

For example, in the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The correct output should be -1, as it is not possible to perform the described sequence of operations with any number of variables. However, the program incorrectly outputs 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
