Example Answer:
The maximum distance `max_dist` is calculated as the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` subtracted by 1, and `n` subtracted by 2. The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing input integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, and `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing input integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, and `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance**
