Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and a list of integers `a`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n` in the list `a`, and the minimum distance between them. Finally, it prints the maximum value between the calculated maximum distance and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not return any value. **
