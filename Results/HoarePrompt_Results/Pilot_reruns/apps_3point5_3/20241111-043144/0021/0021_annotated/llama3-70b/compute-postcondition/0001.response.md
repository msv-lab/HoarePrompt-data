Example Answer:
`a` is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values split by space to integers. Since `input()` accepts input values and `map(int, input().split())` converts these values to integers and creates a list, the values of `n` are stored in `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the input integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the input integers**
