Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100. Therefore, after execution, `n` will be an integer between 2 and 100.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive**
