Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, `max_pos` is the index of element n in list `a`, and `n` is guaranteed to be in list `a`. Therefore, `dist2` is the absolute difference between (`n - 1`) and the index of element n in list `a`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of element n in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of element n in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between (n - 1) and the index of element n in list `a`**.
