Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description by finding the minimum and maximum elements in the list `a`, calculating the distance between these elements and the ends of the list, and then printing the maximum distance. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the provided examples. The annotations also provide a good summary of the code's functionality and help in understanding the logic behind the calculations of distances.
