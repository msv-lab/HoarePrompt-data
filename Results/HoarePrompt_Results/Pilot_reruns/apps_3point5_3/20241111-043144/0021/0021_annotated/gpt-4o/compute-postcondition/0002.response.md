Example Answer:
`min_pos` is assigned the index of the element 1 in list `a`. Since the elements in list `a` are distinct integers and each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive, the index of 1 in list `a` will give the position of 1 in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`**
