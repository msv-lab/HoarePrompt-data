Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap. It does this by finding the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array and then calculating the distances from these elements to the beginning and end of the array. The program then takes the maximum of these distances as the answer, which is the correct approach to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. 

The logic provided covers all potential cases where the minimum and maximum elements are not already at the extreme ends of the array, and performing a swap can increase the distance between them. Additionally, the program correctly handles cases where the minimum and maximum elements are at the extreme ends of the array, as it computes the distances correctly.
