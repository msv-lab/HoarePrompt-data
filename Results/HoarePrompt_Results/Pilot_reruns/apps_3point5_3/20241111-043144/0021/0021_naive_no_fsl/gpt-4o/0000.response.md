Correctness: True

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by considering all possible positions. It finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, calculates the distance from the ends of the array for both elements, and then takes the maximum of these distances. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
