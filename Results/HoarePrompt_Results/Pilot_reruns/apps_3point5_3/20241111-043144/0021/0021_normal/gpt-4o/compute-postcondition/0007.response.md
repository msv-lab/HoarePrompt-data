Example Answer: 
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`. The previous values of `n`, `min_pos`, and other variables are known. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, and `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, and `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`**
