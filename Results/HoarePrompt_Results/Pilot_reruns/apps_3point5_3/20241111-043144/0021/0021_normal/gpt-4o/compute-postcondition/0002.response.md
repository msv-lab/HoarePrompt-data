Example Answer:
The index of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in list `a` is stored in `min_pos`. The previous values of `n` and `a` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`**
