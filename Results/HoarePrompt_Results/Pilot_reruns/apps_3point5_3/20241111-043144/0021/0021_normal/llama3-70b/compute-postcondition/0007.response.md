The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates under the assumption that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. The function does not return any specific output, but its functionality is to work with the list `a` containing n distinct integers from 1 to n.
