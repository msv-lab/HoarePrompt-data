Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` within the range 2 to 100 from user input and a list `a` containing `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order. It then calculates the maximum value between the absolute difference of the indices of 1 and `n` minus 1, and `n - 2` as `max_dist`, as well as the minimum value between the same expression and `n - 2` as `min_dist`. Afterward, it prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not return any specific output. It operates under the assumption that the inputs meet the specified criteria.
