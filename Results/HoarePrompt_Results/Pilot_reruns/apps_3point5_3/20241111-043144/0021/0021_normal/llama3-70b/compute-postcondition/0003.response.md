Example Answer:
The variable `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. As `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, the index of `n` in list `a` would be `n-1`. Therefore, `posn` is assigned the value `n-1`. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is `n-1`**
