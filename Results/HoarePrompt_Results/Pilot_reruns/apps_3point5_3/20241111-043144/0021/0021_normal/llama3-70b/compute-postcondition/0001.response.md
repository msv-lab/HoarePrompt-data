Example Answer: 
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers. The values in the list `a` are distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order. Since `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, the list `a` will contain `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order**
