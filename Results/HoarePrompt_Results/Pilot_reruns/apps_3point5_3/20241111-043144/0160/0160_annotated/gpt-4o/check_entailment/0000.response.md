Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented based on the problem description. 
- `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in a list, which is a crucial step in determining the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list after the operations.
- `func_2` correctly calculates the divisors of each integer in a given list and returns them in sorted, reverse order. This is important as the problem requires finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list after the operations.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotations provided, the code is correct and meets the requirements.
