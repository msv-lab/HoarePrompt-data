According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is updated to the next value after the current square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` is at the current square root of `x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the current square root of `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, `divisors` contains integers from 1 to N, x is greater than or equal to 1, i is updated to the next value after the current square root of x**
