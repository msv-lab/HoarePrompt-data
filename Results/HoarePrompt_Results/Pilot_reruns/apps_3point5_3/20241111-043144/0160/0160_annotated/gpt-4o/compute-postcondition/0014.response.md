Output State: 
If x is 1, the loop will execute once and divisors will contain {1}. 
If x is less than 1, the loop will not execute and divisors will remain an empty set.
For all other cases where x is greater than or equal to 2, divisors will contain all the proper divisors of x, including 1 and x itself. The loop will iterate through all possible divisors of x and add them to the divisors set. 
Output State: **If x is 1, divisors is {1}. If x is less than 1, divisors is {}. For x greater than or equal to 2, divisors contains all proper divisors of x.**
