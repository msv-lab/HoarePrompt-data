According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, `divisors` is an empty set, x is greater than or equal to 1**
