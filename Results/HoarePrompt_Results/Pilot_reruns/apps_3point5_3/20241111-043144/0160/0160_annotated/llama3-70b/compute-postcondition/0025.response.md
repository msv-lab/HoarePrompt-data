Postcondition: ***`gcd` is the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of `gcd` and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1. The square root of `gcd` is at least 1. `i` is 3. After the execution of the if statement, if `i` multiplied by itself is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of the integer division of `gcd` by `i`. This covers all edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the execution of the if else block.***
