According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of `gcd` and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated as described.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue iterating through the loop.
- If `i` is not equal to the square root of `gcd`, then the value of `max_divisor` needs to be further updated based on the conditions mentioned in the loop description.

State: **`gcd` is the result of the gcd operation between the initial value of `gcd` and the elements of list A from index 1 to N-1, `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop description**
