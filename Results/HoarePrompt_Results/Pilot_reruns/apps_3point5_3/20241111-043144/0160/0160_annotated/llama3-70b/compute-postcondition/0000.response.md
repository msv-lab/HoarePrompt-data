Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values by splitting the input. N is an integer between 2 and 500, and K is an integer between 0 and 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9**
