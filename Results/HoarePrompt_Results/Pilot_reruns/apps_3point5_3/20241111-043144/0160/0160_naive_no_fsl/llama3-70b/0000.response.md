Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A and then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd. The program considers all potential cases by iterating through all possible divisors of the gcd and updating the maximum divisor accordingly. It covers all possible scenarios and accurately determines the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
