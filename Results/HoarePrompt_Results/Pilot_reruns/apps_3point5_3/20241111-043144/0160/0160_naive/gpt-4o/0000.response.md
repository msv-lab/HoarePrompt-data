Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of N, K, and the sequence of integers A.
2. The program correctly calculates the sum of all integers in A.
3. The program correctly defines two functions: func_1 to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of integers, and func_2 to calculate the divisors of a given number.
4. The program correctly calculates the gcd of the sequence A and the divisors of the sum of A.
5. The program correctly iterates through the divisors and checks if it can divide every element of A after the operations within the constraints of K.
6. The program correctly prints the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. 

There are no potential cases identified where the code does not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
