Example Answer:
The value of `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and the previous values of `x` are unknown. After calculation, the value of `i` is updated. The set `divisors` then adds the value of `i` to its collection. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer, and `divisors` contains the updated values of `i`.
Output State: **N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer, `divisors` contains the updated values of `i`**
