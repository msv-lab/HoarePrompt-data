Example Answer:
The value of `i` (which is 2) is added to the set `divisors`. If `divisors` was empty before, it now contains 2. If `divisors` already contained some values before, 2 is added to the existing values. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer, `divisors` contains 2.
Output State: **N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer, `divisors` contains 2**
