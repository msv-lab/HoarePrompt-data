Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is a perfect square and `N` is an integer where N >= 2, the value of `max_divisor` will be updated accordingly based on the division. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer where N >= 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`**
