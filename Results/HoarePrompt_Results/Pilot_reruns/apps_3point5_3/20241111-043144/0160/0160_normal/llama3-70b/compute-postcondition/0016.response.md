Postcondition: ***`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer such that N >= 2, and `max_divisor` is the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor`, `gcd // i`, and `gcd // (gcd // i)`, where `i` is a divisor of `gcd`. The postcondition covers all cases where `gcd % i == 0` and updates `max_divisor` accordingly to consider all divisors of `gcd`, including the case where the square of a divisor is not equal to `gcd`.***
