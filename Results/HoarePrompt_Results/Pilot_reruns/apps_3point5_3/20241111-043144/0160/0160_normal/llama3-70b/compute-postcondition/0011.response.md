Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, N is an integer such that N >= 2, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9. If N is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `gcd` remains the value of the first element in list `A`. `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`**
