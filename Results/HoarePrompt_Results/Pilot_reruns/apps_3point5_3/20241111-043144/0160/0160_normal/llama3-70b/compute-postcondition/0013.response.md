Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. `max_divisor` is initially the value of `gcd`, and `i` doesn't have a specified initial value. After running the code, `max_divisor` will be the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` (which is a perfect square) and `i`. 
Output State: **`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer such that N >= 2, `max_divisor` is the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `i`**
