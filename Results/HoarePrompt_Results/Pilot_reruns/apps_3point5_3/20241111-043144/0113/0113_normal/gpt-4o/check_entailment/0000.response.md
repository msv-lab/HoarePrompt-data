Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the function to perform the k-rounding of a given positive integer `n`. The function `func_1` calculates the value of `x` by multiplying `n` with the result of `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`, where `multiplier` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`. This logic aligns with the problem description of finding the minimum positive integer x that ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, including the constraints on the input values for `n` (ranging from 1 to 10^9) and `k` (ranging from 0 to 8). The output of the function `func_1` is dependent on the specific values of `n` and `k` provided as input, and the code correctly calculates the k-rounding of n in all cases.

Therefore, based on the alignment of the code with the problem description and the correct implementation of the k-rounding function, the correctness of the code is **True**.
