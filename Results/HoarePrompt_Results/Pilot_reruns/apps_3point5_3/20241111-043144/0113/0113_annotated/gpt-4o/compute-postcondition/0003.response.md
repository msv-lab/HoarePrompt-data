The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints for these parameters are that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the function calculates the value of `multiplier` based on the value of `k`, where `multiplier` can be one of `1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000`. The function then returns the product of `n` and `multiplier` as `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculate the appropriate multiplier based on the value of `k`, and then return the product of `n` and the calculated multiplier as `x`.
