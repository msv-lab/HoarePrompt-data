Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The value of `n` is unknown, but `multiplier` is one of the provided values. The result of the calculation depends on the values of `n` and `multiplier`. After the calculation, `x` will have a new value based on the formula. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `multiplier` is one of `1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000`, and `x` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`multiplier` is one of `1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000`, and `x` is calculated based on the formula**
