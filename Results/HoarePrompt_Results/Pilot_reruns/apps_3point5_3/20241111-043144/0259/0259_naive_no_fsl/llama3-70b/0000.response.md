Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by taking the input of the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the arrival time and interval for each bus route. It then calculates the time for each bus route based on Serval's arrival time and the interval between buses. The program correctly determines the bus route that Serval will use and prints the output accordingly. The logic of finding the minimum time and corresponding bus route index is implemented correctly. The program handles all potential cases and outputs the correct bus route based on the problem description.
