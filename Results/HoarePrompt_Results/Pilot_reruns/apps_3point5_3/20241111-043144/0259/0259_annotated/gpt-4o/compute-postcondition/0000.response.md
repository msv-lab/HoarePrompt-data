Example Answer:
`min_wait_time` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity**
