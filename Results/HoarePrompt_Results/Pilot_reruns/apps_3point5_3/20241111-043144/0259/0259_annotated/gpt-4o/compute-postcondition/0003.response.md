Example Answer: 
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are extracted from the tuple at index `i` of the list `bus_routes`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are dependent on the specific tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, `s_i` is the source value from the tuple at index `i`, `d_i` is the destination value from the tuple at index `i`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, `s_i` is the source value from the tuple at index `i`, `d_i` is the destination value from the tuple at index `i`**
