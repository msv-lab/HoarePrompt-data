Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples. min_wait_time is assigned the minimum value among wait_time and min_wait_time. chosen_route is updated to the value of i + 1. For all cases, if wait_time is less than min_wait_time, it replaces min_wait_time and chosen_route is updated accordingly. The postcondition ensures that the program correctly updates min_wait_time and chosen_route based on the conditions specified within the if else block, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
