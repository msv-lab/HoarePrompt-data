Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not impact any other variables. Therefore, the output state is: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time and chosen_route are updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i, and wait_time is 0.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time and chosen_route are updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, and wait_time is 0**
