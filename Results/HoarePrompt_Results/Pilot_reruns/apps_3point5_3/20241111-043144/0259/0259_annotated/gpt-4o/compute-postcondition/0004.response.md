Example Answer:
The `wait_time` variable is calculated as the difference between the source value `s_i` and the positive integer `t`. Since the initial state does not mention the specific values of `s_i` and `t`, the output state will be dependent on these values. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, wait_time is the difference between the source value `s_i` and the positive integer `t`, `s_i` is the source value from the tuple at index `i`, `d_i` is the destination value from the tuple at index `i`**
