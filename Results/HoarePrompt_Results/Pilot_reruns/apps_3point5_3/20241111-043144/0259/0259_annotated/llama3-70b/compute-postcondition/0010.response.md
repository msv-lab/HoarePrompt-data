Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are not specified, so the output state will be: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`**
