Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input in the form of two integers `s` and `d` and assigns them to variables `s` and `d` respectively. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`**
