Example Answer:
The value of `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. The values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are involved in the calculation. The initial state does not provide the value of `t`, so the exact value of `wait_time` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`**
