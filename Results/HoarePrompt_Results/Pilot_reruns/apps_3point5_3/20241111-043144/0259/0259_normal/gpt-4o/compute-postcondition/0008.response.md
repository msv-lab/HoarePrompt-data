Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. The `wait_time` variable is determined based on the conditions: if `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`; if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring all possible scenarios and edge cases are covered.***
