Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers, `i` is less than `n`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the calculation of `wait_time` based on the conditions in the if-else block.***
