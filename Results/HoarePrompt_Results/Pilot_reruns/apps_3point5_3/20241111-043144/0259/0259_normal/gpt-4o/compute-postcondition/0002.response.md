According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `min_wait_time` is positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1, these values do not affect the loop execution directly, but for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than 0. 
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0**
