Output State: **After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions within the loop, `chosen_route` is the route corresponding to the minimum wait time. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute and `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity, and `chosen_route` will remain -1.**
