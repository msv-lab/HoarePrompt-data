Example Answer: 
`chosen_route` is assigned the value -1. The initial state of `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, and it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1**
