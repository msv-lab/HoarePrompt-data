Example Answer: 
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unknown in the initial state, so the value of `chosen_route` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
