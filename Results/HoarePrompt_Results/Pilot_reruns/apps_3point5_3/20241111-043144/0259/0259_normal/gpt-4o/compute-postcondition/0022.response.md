According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it should be adjusted to `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute again.
State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is less than `n`**
