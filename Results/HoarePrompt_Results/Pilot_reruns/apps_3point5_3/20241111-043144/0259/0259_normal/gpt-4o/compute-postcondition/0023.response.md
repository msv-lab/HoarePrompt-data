Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`, where `i` is the current value of the loop variable. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` will now hold the values of the source and destination of the bus route at index `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`**
