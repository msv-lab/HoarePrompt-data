Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition (t - s_i) % d_i == 0 is satisfied, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i. This covers all possible scenarios after the if else block executes, ensuring the correct calculation and assignment of `wait_time` based on the given conditions.***
