Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, and `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. Therefore, after execution, `chosen_route` is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is i + 1**
