According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, n is between 1 and 100. To execute one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to be less than n. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `_` is less than n.
State: **n is between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, buses contains tuples (s, d), _ is less than n**
