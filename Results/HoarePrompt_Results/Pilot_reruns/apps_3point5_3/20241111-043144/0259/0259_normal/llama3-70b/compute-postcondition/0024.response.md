Postcondition: ***`min_time` is assigned the minimum value between the current time and the calculated time based on the second tuple in the list `buses`. `ans` is set to 2. `buses` remains unchanged with at least 2 tuples. `i` remains as 1. `s` and `d` are the values of the second tuple in the list. `time` is recalculated based on the formula `(t - s) % d`.***
