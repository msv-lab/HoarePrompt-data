Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads the input values correctly and stores them in a list of tuples. It then calculates the minimum time based on the input tuples and prints the index of the tuple that resulted in the minimum time. The code follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output based on the given scenarios. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented.
