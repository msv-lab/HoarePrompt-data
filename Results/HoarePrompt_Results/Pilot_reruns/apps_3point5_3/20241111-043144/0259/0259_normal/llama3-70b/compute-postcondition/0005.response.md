According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 100. This means the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple (s, d) where s and d are input integers**
