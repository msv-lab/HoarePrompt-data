Postcondition: ***`min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, `ans` is 1, `buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list. This assignment occurs if `time` is less than `min_time`. Otherwise, the initial state remains unchanged with `min_time` as infinity, `ans` as -1, `buses` as a list with at least 1 element, `i` as 0, `s` and `d` as the values of the first tuple in the list.***
