Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned the values `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input, splits it, and converts it to integers. Since the previous values of `s` and `d` are unknown, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are input integers.
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are input integers**
