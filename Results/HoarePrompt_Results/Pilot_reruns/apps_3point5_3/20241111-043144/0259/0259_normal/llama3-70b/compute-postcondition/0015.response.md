According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `buses`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start, `min_time` is infinity and `ans` is -1. To ensure the loop executes, `buses` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list.
State: **`min_time` is infinity, `ans` is -1, `buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list**
