According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` and `buses` do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1.
State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list**
