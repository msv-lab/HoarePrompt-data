Postcondition: ***`min_time` is assigned the minimum value between the current time and the recalculated time based on the second tuple in the list `buses`. `ans` is set to 3. `buses` remains unchanged with at least 2 tuples. `i` is 2. `s` and `d` are the values of the second tuple in the list. `time` is recalculated based on the formula `(t - s) % d`. If the recalculated time is less than the minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the recalculated time and `ans` is set to 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
