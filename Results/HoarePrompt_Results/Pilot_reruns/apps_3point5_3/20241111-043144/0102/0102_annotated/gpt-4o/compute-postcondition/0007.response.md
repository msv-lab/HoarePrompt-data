Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representing the tens place of `n`. Otherwise, the function returns a string representing `n` in words, combining the word representing the tens place of `n`, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones place of `n`.***
