The list `ones` is assigned with the values from 'zero' to 'nine'. The list `ones` now contains words representing the numbers from 0 to 9. Since the variable `n` is not affected by this code snippet, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine**
