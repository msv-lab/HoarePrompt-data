Example Answer:
The code returns a string concatenation of the word representing the tens digit of `n` from the `tens` list, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones digit of `n` from the `ones` list. Given the constraints on `n` and the contents of the `tens` and `ones` lists, the resulting string will represent the number `n` in words. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns a string representing `n` in words.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns a string representing `n` in words**
