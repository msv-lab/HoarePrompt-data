Example Answer:
The function returns the word representation of the number `n` by accessing the index `n` in the list `ones`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, the function returns the word representation of that number. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representation of the input number.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representation of the input number**
