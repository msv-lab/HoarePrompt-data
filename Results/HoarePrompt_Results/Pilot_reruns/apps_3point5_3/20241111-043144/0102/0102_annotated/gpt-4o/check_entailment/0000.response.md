Correctness: True

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the word representation of that number based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is between 0 and 9, between 11 and 19, and between 10 and 99. It returns the word representing the tens place of `n` if `n` is divisible by 10, and a string representing `n` in words by combining the word representing the tens place of `n`, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones place of `n` if `n` is not divisible by 10. The code annotations provide a clear explanation of what each part of the code does, and they align with the problem description. All the provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the code.
