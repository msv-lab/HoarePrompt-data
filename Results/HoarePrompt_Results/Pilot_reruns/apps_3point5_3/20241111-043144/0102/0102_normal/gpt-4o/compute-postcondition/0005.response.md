Example Answer:
The code snippet returns the value at the index `n // 10` in the list `tens`. Since `s` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, `n` would be `s`. Depending on the value of `s`, the index `n // 10` would be either 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. The final result will be the value at the calculated index in the list `tens`.
Output State: **The function returns the value at the index `s // 10` in the list `tens`**
