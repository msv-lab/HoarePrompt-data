Example Answer:
The function returns the value at the index `n - 10` in the list `teens`. Since `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, the value of `n` can be in the range 10 to 19. Therefore, the function will return the corresponding value from the list `teens`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, and the function returns the value corresponding to the input in the list `teens`.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, and the function returns the value corresponding to the input in the list `teens`**
