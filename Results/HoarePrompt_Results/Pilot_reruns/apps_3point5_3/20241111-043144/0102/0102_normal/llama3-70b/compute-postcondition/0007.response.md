Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list containing string representations of tens from zero to ninety. If `s` is less than 20, then the code prints the string representation of the input integer `s` from the teens list after subtracting 10. If `s` is 20 or greater, the code prints the string representation of the tens place of `s` from the `tens` list followed by a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `s` from the ones list, unless the ones place is 0.***
