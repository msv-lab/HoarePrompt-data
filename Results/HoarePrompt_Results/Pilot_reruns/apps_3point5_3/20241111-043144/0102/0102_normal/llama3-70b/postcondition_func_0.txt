The function takes user input as an integer between 0 and 99 and prints out the corresponding English word representation of that number. If the input is less than 10, it prints the word from the 'ones' list. If the input is between 10 and 19, it prints the word from the 'teens' list. If the input is 20 or greater, it prints the word representing the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representing the ones place. The function does not have any return value.
