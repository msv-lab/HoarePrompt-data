Example Answer: 
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order, which changes the order of elements in the list. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and the list `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from `s`**
