Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the result of converting the input string into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
