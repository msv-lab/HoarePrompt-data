Example Answer:
The list `s` is created by mapping the input string split by spaces to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range**
