Example Answer:
The value of `max_shares` is calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`. Since `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`, the result of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price` will yield the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`, and `max_shares` is the maximum number of shares that can be bought.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`, and `max_shares` is the maximum number of shares that can be bought**
