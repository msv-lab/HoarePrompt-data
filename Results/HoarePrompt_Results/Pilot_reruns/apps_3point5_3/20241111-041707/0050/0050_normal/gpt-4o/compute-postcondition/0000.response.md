Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input using `split()`. Since `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, the values are valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range**
