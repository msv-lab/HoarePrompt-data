The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined integer values n, m, and r, where 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, and 1 <= r <= 1000. It also uses integer values s_i and b_i, where 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given constraints.
