Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `shares` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated as `r += shares * b[i]`, `shares` is then set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, `r` remains 0, and `shares` is 0. In both cases, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `s` has at least one element. If the if condition is satisfied, the program calculates `r` based on the given formula, otherwise, the program breaks out of the loop.***
