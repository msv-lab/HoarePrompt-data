Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in descending order using the `sort` method with the `reverse=True` parameter. Since `b` was initially sorted in ascending order, after sorting in reverse, `b` is now sorted in descending order. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30; `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
