Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values by splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is assumed to be valid integers separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are updated based on the input values provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
