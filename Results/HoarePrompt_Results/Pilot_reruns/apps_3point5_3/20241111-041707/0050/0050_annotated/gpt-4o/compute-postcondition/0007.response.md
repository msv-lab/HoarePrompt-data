Example Answer:
`remaining_bourles` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. The values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are positive integers, so `remaining_bourles` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is a positive integer, and `remaining_bourles` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is a positive integer, and `remaining_bourles` is a positive integer**
