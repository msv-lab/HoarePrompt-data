You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Welcome to Codeforces Stock Exchange! We're pretty limited now as we currently allow trading on one stock, Codeforces Ltd. We hope you'll still be able to make profit from the market!

In the morning, there are $n$ opportunities to buy shares. The $i$-th of them allows to buy as many shares as you want, each at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

In the evening, there are $m$ opportunities to sell shares. The $i$-th of them allows to sell as many shares as you want, each at the price of $b_i$ bourles. You can't sell more shares than you have.

It's morning now and you possess $r$ bourles and no shares.

What is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m, r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, $1 \leq m \leq 30$, $1 \leq r \leq 1000$) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
4 2 5
4 4 5 4

Output
26

Input
2 2 50
5 7
4 2

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first example test, you have $11$ bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy $5$ shares of a stock at the price of $2$ bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of $5$ bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have $26$ bourles after the evening.

In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n, m, r = map(int, input().split())
    #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers
    min_buy_price = min(s)
    #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`
    max_sell_price = max(b)
    #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`
    if (max_sell_price <= min_buy_price) :
        print(r)
        #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price` remain unchanged.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price` remain unchanged.
    else :
        max_shares = r // min_buy_price
        #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, and `max_shares` is a positive integer
        remaining_bourles = r % min_buy_price
        #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is a positive integer, and `remaining_bourles` is a positive integer
        total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles
        #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is a positive integer, `remaining_bourles` is a positive integer, and `total_bourles` is a positive integer
        print(total_bourles)
        #State of the program here: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles` remain unchanged
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles` remain unchanged
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, the program prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, the program calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining money after the purchase of those shares, and the total amount of money after selling those shares. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func` reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum value in list `s` as `min_buy_price` and the maximum value in list `b` as `max_sell_price`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining money after the purchase, and the total amount of money after selling those shares. This total amount is then printed.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
