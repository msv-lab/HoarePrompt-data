Example Answer:
The input values are converted to a list of integers and assigned to variable `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers**
