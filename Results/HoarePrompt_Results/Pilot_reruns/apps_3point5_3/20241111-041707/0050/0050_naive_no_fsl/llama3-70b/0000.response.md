Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It iterates through the buying opportunities and buys as many shares as possible, then iterates through the selling opportunities and sells all the shares bought earlier. The program handles the case where you can't buy any shares or where you can't sell any shares. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
