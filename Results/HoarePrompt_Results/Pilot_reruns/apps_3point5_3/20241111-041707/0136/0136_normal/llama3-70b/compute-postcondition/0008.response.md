Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings, `a` and `b`, compares them, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are not valid non-negative integers, or if they contain leading zeros.**
