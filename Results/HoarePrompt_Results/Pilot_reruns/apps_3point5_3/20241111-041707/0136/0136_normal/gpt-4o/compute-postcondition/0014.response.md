Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `data` list with leading zeros stripped. If `a` is an empty string, it is reassigned to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits. If `b` is not already assigned a value, it is reassigned to '0'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, then the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, then the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the program prints '='. This covers all scenarios including the edge cases where `a` is empty or `b` is not assigned a value.***
