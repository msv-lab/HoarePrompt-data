Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads two very long integers a and b and compares them. It removes leading zeroes from both numbers using the lstrip('0') function. Then it compares the two numbers and prints the appropriate symbol "<", ">", or "=" based on the comparison.

The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description:
1. If a < b, it prints "<".
2. If a > b, it prints ">".
3. If a = b, it prints "=".

The program logic is correct and handles all cases as per the problem description.
