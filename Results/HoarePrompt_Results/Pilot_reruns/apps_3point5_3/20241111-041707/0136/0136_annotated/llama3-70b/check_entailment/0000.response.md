Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` represented as strings with no leading zeroes. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The program covers all possible comparison scenarios between `a` and `b` as described in the problem description. The code annotations also confirm that the program handles all cases where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no leading zeroes. Hence, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
