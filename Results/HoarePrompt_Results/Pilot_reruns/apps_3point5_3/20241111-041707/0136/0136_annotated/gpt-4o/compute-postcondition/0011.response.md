Output State: **`a` and `b` are derived from `data[0]` and `data[1]` respectively after removing leading zeros. If `a` is empty (no value after removing leading zeros), then `a` is assigned the string '0'. If `b` is empty, then both `a` and `b` are assigned the string '0'. Otherwise, `b` retains its previous value.**
