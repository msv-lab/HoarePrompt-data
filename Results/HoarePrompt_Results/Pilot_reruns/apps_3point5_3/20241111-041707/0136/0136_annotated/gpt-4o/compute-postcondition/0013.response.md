Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `a` and `b` are derived from `data[0]` and `data[1]` respectively after removing leading zeros. If `a` is empty (no value after removing leading zeros), then `a` is assigned the string '0'. If `b` is empty, then both `a` and `b` are assigned the string '0'. Otherwise, `b` retains its previous value. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. All possible cases are handled, including when `a` and `b` are empty or have non-numeric values after removing leading zeros.***
