Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b` from user input, removes leading zeros, compares them, and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b`, or '=', if they are equal. The function covers scenarios where `a` or `b` are empty after removing leading zeros, assigning '0' in those cases. It does not handle cases where `a` or `b` contain non-numeric values or exceed 10^6 digits.**
