Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y based on the starting equilateral triangle side length x. The program calculates this by subtracting y from x, then dividing the result by 2 and adding the modulo of (x - y) and 2. This logic works correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints, as it ensures that the side lengths of the triangle remain integers and the triangle remains non-degenerate throughout the process. All the provided examples also work correctly with the program logic.
