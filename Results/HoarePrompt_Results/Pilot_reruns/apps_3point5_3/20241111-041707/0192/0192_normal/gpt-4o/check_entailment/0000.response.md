Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, ensuring they satisfy 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided. The output hints also agree with the code and there are no edge cases mentioned that the code fails to cover. Hence, the code is correct.
