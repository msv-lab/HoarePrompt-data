Example Answer: 
The expression calculates the difference between `x` and `y`, then divides it by 2 and adds the remainder of the division. Since `x` and `y` are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result of the expression will always be an integer. Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression**
