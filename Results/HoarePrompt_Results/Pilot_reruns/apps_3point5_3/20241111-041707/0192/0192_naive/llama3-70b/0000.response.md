Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program simply calculates the absolute difference between the two side lengths x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y is not equal to the absolute difference between x and y. The program is not following the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, if the input is 6 3, the program will output 3, but the correct output should be 4.
