Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two integers n and k, then calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, in which case it returns -1. 
If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, it calculates the divisor d as n divided by the minimum sum. It then calculates the remainder after dividing n by the minimum sum. 
The program then constructs the sequence of k positive numbers by multiplying each index with d and adding 1 to k elements in the sequence based on the remainder. 
The program then prints the resulting sequence if it's valid, otherwise it prints -1.
The logic in the program seems correct as it correctly calculates the sequence of k positive numbers with the maximum greatest common divisor for the given input n and k.
