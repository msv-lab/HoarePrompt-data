Correctness: False

The given program does not always produce a sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is n and whose greatest common divisor is maximal. 

For example, for the input:
6 3

The program outputs:
1 2

However, the correct output should be:
1 2 3

Therefore, the program does not always adhere to the problem description and is incorrect.
