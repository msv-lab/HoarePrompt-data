The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case_1, `min_sum` represents the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `n`, `k`, and `min_sum`.

In Case_2, if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If `remainder` is 0, the loop breaks immediately. After the loop executes, `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum` minus the number of iterations done; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + the number of iterations done` for all `i` in the range `k` in reverse order. The function returns the `sequence` list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, and return a sequence list based on certain conditions. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.
