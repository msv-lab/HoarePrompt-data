Output State: `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum` minus 1; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for all `i` in the range `k`; Index `i` is -1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop breaks and there are no further changes in the variables. Otherwise, the program continues with the next part of the code. The value at index `i` in the `sequence` list is incremented by 1. `remainder` is decremented by 1.
