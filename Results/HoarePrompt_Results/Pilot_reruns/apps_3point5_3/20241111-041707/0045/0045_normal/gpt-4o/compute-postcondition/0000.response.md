Example Answer:
The value of `min_sum` is calculated by multiplying `k` with `k+1` and then dividing the result by 2. Since `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, the value of `min_sum` will be a positive integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer**
