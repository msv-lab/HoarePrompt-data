The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. If the calculated `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates `d` as the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, computes the `remainder` as `n - d * min_sum`, and creates a `sequence` list with elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. If `remainder` is 0, the function returns the `sequence` list. If `remainder` is not 0, the function modifies the `sequence` list by incrementing elements from the end until `remainder` becomes 0, and then returns the updated `sequence` list.
