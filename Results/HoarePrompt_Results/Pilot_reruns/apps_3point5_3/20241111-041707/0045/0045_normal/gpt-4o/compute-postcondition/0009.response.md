Output State: `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-1`, and if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
