According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is within the range from `k-1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 2`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-3`, `remainder` is decremented by 2, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. `i` needs to be adjusted to `k-4` to ensure it remains within the range of `k-1` to 0.
2. `remainder` needs to be adjusted by decrementing it by 2 again.
3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 4`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `k-4`, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
