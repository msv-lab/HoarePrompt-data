Output State: If `remainder` is 0, the loop will not execute. In this case, `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is 0, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, and `k` is at least 1. If `remainder` is not 0, the loop will execute and decrement `remainder` at each iteration. After the loop executes, `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to `k-1`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, and `k` is at least 1.
