Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, performs the Euclidean algorithm on them in a loop until `b` becomes 0, and then returns the final value of `a`. If either `a` or `b` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the initial values of `a` and `b`. The function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.**
