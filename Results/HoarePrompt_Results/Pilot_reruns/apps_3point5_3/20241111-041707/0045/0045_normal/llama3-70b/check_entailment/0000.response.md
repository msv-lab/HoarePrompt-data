Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
- It checks if `n` is less than `k`, then it outputs -1 as there is no possible sequence.
- Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `seq`.
- It then iterates from 1 to `k + 1` and appends numbers to `seq` in increasing order until the sum reaches `n` or the iteration is completed.
- If the length of `seq` is not equal to `k`, it outputs -1.
- Otherwise, it prints the sequence `seq` as output.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it generates a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum is equal to `n`. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
