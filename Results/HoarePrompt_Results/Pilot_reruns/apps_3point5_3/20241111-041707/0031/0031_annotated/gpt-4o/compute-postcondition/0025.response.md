Output State: **`numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD` retain their previous values; `i` is 0, `k` is the original value, `total_days` remains unchanged, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated, `A` is updated to the floor division of `A` by `g`, `B` is updated to the floor division of `B` by `g`, and `g` holds the return value of `func_1(A, B)`**
