Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the return value of `func_1(A, B)`, where `A` is `p_shared` and `B` is `p_total`. The previous values of `p_shared` and `p_total` are assigned to `A` and `B` respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD` retain their previous values; `i` is 0, `k` is the original value, `total_days` remains unchanged, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` holds the return value of `func_1(A, B)`.
Output State: **`numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD` retain their previous values; `i` is 0, `k` is the original value, `total_days` remains unchanged, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` holds the return value of `func_1(A, B)`**
