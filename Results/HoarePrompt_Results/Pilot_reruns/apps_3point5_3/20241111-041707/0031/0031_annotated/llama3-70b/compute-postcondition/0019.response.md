Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the total number of days based on the value of `n`, then updates the `numerator` and `denominator` in a loop depending on the value of `k`. After that, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`, divides `numerator` and `denominator` by the gcd, and returns the remainders of these divisions. If `k` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the function still calculates the gcd and returns the remainders.**
