Example Answer:
The `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`, which can be any integer between 1 and 10^18. The `numerator` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer at least 2, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, and `denominator` is updated.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer at least 2, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, `denominator` is updated**
