According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer at least 2, `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`, `denominator` is updated, `i` is less than `k`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer at least 2, `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`, `denominator` is updated, `i` is less than `k+1`**
