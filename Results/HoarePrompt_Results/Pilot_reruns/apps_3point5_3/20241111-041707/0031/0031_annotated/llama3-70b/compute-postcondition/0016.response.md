Example Answer: 
After executing `denominator //= gcd`, the value of `denominator` is updated by performing integer division with the value of `gcd`. The previous state of variables is not provided, so the output state is `numerator //= gcd` has been executed, and `denominator` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`numerator //= gcd` has been executed, `denominator` is updated accordingly**
