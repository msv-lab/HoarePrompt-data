According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute k times. Therefore, before the loop starts, total_days is 2 raised to the power of n, numerator is 1, and denominator is 1. To ensure the loop executes, n must be a valid integer, k must be at least 2, and i should start from 0.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of n, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` starts from 0**
