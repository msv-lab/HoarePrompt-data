Example Answer: 
`denominator` is assigned the value `1`, but the previous value of `denominator` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is 2 raised to the power of n; numerator is 1; denominator is 1.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is 2 raised to the power of n; numerator is 1; denominator is 1**
