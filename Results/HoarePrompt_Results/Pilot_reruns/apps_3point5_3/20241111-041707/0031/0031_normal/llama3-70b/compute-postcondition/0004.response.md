Example Answer:
`numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`. The previous values are `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` starts from 0. After execution, the new value of `numerator` will depend on the values of `total_days`, `i`, and the previous value of `numerator`. 
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` starts from 0**
