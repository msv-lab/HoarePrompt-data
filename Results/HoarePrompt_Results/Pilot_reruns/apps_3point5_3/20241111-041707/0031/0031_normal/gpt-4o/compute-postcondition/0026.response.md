Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values based on loop condition, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the formula, `A` is equal to `p_no_shared // g`, `B` is equal to the updated value of `B` after division by `g`, `g` is assigned the return value of `func_1(A, B)`, then `print(A % MOD, B % MOD)` is executed.**
