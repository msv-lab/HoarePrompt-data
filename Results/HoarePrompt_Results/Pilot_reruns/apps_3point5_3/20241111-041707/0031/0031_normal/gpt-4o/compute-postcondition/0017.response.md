Output State: **After the loop executes, `numerator` will contain the product of `(total_days - k + 1)` to `(total_days - 1)` modulo `MOD`, and `denominator` will contain the product of `1` to `total_days` modulo `MOD`. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and `numerator` will remain 1, `denominator` will remain 1.**
