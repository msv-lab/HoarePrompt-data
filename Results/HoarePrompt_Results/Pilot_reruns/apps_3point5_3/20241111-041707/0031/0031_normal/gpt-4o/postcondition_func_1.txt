The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates certain values based on a loop and function call, then prints the results after some calculations. There is missing functionality if k is not greater than 1 shifted left by n, as the code does not specify any further action in this case.
