According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated to a new value after the calculation, `denominator` is updated to a new value after the calculation, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0**
