Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer assigned by user input, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n` minus `remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n` plus (10 minus `remainder`).***
