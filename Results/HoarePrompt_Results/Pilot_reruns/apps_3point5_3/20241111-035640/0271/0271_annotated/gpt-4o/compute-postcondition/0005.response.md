Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is calculated as `n` minus `remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is calculated as `n` plus (10 minus `remainder`). The final output is then printed using `print(result)`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer assigned by user input, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, `result` is calculated based on the conditions given in the code snippet**
