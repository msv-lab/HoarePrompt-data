Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It calculates the remainder when dividing the input number by 10, then based on the remainder, it rounds the number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The if-else conditions handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The program covers scenarios where the remainder is less than or equal to 5, as well as when it is greater than 5. The output is correct for all the provided examples and the logic is sound, ensuring that the rounding is done as expected.
