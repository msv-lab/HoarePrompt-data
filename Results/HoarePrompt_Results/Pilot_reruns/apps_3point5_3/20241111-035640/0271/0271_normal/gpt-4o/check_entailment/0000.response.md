Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer input `n`, calculates the remainder when divided by 10, and then rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with zero. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from `n` to get the rounded number. If the remainder is greater than 5, it adds `10 - remainder` to `n` to get the rounded number. This logic aligns with the problem description, where Vasya wants to round the number to the nearest integer ending with zero. The code covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario.
