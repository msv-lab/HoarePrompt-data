Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is the subtraction of `remainder` from `n`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is the addition of `n` and `10 - remainder`. This covers all possible scenarios for the values of `n` and `remainder`, ensuring the correct calculation of `result` based on the condition met in the if-else block.***
