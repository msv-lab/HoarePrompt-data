Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the remainder will be between 0 and 9 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is between 0 and 9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is between 0 and 9**
