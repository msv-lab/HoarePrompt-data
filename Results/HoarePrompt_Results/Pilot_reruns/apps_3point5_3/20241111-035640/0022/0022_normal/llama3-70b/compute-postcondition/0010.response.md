Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` is set to 1, and the loop or if statement is terminated. This condition covers all possible cases where the palindrome property is violated at a specific position `i` in the string `s`.***
