According to the code, the loop will execute if n is at least 2 because n // 2 will be at least 1. The loop will iterate n // 2 times. Before the loop starts, the key state adjustments needed are that `n` should be at least 2, `i` should start at 0, and `s` should be a non-empty string.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
