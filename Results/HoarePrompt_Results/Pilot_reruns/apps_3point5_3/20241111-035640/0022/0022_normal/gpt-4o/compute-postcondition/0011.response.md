Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the characters at symmetric indices in `s` are not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, the loop will compare characters from the start and end of the string towards the middle, checking for symmetry. If the loop does not execute due to n being less than 2, no comparison is made.**
