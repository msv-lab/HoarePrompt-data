Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters. The function checks if the characters at symmetrical positions in the string are equal. It returns True if all characters are equal, and False otherwise, while ensuring `n` is at least 2. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. **
