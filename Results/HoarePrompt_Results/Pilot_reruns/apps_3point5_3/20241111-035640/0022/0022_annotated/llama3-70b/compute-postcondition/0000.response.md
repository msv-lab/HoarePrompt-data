`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since the precondition states that `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 consisting of only English letters, the output state is `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters**
