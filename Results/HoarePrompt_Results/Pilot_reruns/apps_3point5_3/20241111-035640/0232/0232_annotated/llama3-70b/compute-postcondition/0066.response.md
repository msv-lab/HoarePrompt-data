Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met. `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary. `n` is an integer greater than 0. `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is incremented by 1. `j` is equal to `i + 1`. `i` is less than `n`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j + 1]`. `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all the counts in the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is broken.***
