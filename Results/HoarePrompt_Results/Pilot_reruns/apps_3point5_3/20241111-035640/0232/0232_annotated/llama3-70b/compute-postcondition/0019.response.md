According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `found` is False and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`found` is False, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, `n` is greater than 0**
