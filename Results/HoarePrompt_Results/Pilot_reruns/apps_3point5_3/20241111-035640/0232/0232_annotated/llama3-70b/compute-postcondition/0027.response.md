Output State: **`found` is True, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` initialized to 0 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `j` is equal to `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
