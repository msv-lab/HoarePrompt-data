Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met, `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j + 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
