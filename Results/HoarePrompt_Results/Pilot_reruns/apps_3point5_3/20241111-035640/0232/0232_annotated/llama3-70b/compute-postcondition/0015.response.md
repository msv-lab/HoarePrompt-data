Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The value of `color_counts[color]` is 0 if `color` is not already in `color_counts`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `color_counts[color]` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers with at least 3 colors left to iterate over, counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; color_counts is a dictionary with one key-value pair where color is the key and the value is 1 if color is not already in color_counts. If color is already in color_counts, its value remains unchanged.**
