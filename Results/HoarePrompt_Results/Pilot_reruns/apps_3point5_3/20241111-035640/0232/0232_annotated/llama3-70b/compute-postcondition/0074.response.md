Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met, `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with specific color counts incremented by 2, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` or `colors[j + 1]`, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks.***
