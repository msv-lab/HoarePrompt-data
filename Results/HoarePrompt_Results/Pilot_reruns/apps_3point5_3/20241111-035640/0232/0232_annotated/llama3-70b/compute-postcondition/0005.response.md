Example Answer:
`color_counts` is assigned the value `0` for the key `color`. Since `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, this creates a new key-value pair with key `color` and value `0`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 color, counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; color_counts is a dictionary with one key-value pair where color is the key and 0 is the value.
