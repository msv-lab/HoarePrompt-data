Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met. If the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with an initial value of 0 and incremented on subsequent occurrences. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute.***
