Example Answer:
The list `counts` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers. The length of the `counts` list is `m`, and the sum of all elements in `counts` is <= n. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n**
