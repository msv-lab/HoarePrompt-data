Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the values of k, `current_counts` is a dictionary with incremented count for the color at index `right` and it is less than the desired count, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts equal to their desired counts, then the function returns 'YES'.***
