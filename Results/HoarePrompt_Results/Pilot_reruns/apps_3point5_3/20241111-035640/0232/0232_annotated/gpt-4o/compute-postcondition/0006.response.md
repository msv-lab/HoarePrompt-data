Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the values of k, `current_counts` is a dictionary with incremented count for the color at index `right`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all the counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts` for every color, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
