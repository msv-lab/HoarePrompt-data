Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly iterates through the list of Jedi Knights, keeping track of the counts of each color of lightsabers encountered so far. It then uses a sliding window approach to check if there is a contiguous interval that matches the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval is found and 'NO' otherwise. The logic seems sound and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
