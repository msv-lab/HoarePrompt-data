Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in `current_counts` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If all counts in `current_counts` match the corresponding counts in `desired_counts` for all colors at index `right`, `current_counts` have been updated accordingly, and `right` has been incremented.
Output State: **If all counts in `current_counts` match the corresponding counts in `desired_counts` for all colors at index `right`, `current_counts` have been updated accordingly, and `right` has been incremented**
