Postcondition: ***desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k, current_counts is a defaultdict with all values set to 0 corresponding to keys from 1 to m, left is 0, right is 0. If all elements in current_counts match the corresponding elements in desired_counts for every color in desired_counts, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
