Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` with their corresponding values in list `k`. `current_counts` is a defaultdict with all values set to 0 corresponding to keys from 1 to `m` except for one color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`. `left` is 0, `right` is 0. If all counts in `current_counts` match the corresponding counts in `desired_counts` for all colors, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program remains in the same state with the initial values of the variables intact.***
