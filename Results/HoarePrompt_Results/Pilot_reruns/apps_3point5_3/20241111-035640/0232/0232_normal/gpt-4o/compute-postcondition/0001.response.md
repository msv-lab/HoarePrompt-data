Example Answer:
`current_counts` is assigned a defaultdict with an initial value of 0 for any key that is accessed. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with an initial value of 0.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with an initial value of 0**
