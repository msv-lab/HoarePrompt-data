Example Answer:
The dictionary `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Since this operation does not affect the values of `found` and `n`, the output state is: `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
