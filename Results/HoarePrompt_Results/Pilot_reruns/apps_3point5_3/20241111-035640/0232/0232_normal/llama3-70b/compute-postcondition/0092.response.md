Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `window_counts` remains consistent with color addition logic, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `color` is the color at index 1 in the list `colors`. If `color` was not initially present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0.***
