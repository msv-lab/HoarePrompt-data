Example Answer:
The value of `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The value of `j+1` maintains its initial condition, so `color` will be assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list. All other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`found` is a boolean, `n` is a positive integer, `j+1` maintains its initial condition, `i` maintains its initial condition, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list**
