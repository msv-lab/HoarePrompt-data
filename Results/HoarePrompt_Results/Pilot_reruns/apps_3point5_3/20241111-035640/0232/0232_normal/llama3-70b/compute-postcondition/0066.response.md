Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. If all window counts match the target counts, `found` is set to True, and `n` remains a positive integer. `j+1` and `i` maintain their initial conditions. `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
