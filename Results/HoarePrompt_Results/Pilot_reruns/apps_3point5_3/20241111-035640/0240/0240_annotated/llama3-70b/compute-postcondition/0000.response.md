Example Answer: 
The set `t_set` is created by converting the string `t` into a set. The previous values of `t` and `t_set` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: s and t are strings, t_set is a set containing unique elements from string t.
Output State: **s and t are strings, t_set is a set containing unique elements from string t**
