Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, which means the character `c` is added to the end of the string `n`. As the initial state states that `n` is an empty string `''`, the new value of `n` will be the character `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c`**
