Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned an empty string `''`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is an empty string `''`.
Output State: **`s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is an empty string `''`**
