According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the characters in the string `s`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c` if `c` is present in `t_set. If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated to include `c`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next character in `s` should be considered.
State: **`s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the next character in `s`**
