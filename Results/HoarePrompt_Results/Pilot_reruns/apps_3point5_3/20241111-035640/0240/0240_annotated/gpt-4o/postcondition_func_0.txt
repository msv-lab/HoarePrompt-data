The function func_1 accepts two parameters, s and sub, which are strings of digits. It calculates the subtraction of the two strings, updates the counts of characters in s and sub, generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters, finds the smallest number from the list of possible numbers, assigns it to smallest_number, and finally returns the smallest_number.
