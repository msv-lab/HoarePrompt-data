Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with respect to the state of `sub`, then the generator yields `candidate`. If `chars` or `sub` are empty strings, the loop will not execute.**
