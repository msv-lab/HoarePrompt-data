Example Answer: 
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`, which is a string obtained by joining the characters of the first permutation of `chars`. Since the initial state mentions that `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` would be equal to `perm`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the first permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the first permutation of `chars`**
