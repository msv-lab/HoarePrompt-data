Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation `perm`. The values of `chars` and `perm` are unknown, but `chars` is a string of digits and `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation of `chars`**
