According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more permutations to generate. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the first permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `perm` should be the next permutation of `chars`.
State: **`chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation of `chars`.**
