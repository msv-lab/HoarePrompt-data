Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the first permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub`, then `candidate` is yielded. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
