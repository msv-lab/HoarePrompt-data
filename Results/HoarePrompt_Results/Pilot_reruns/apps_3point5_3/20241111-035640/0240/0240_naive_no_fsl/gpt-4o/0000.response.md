Correctness: **True**

The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `sub`, then it generates all possible permutations of the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters in `sub`. It then checks if the generated permutations are valid numbers with the given substring `sub`. Finally, it outputs the smallest valid number.

The logic of the program seems correct as it follows the problem description by generating all possible valid numbers that can be formed from the given string `s` and substring `sub`. The program uses permutations to find all possible combinations of the remaining characters in `s`, and then checks if the generated numbers are valid by ensuring that the substring `sub` is present in the number. 

Since the program follows the problem description and generates the smallest possible initial integer `n` as required, it can be considered correct.
