According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is a string representing the concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation needs to be considered.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, the following changes are needed:
- The next permutation of `chars` needs to be considered.
- The `candidate` needs to be updated with the new permutation.
- The new `candidate` needs to be checked if it is a valid number with `sub` as a substring.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit (next permutation), `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is a string representing the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` as a substring, then the code yields `candidate`.**
