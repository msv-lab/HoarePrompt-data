Example Answer:
`candidate` is yielded as a result of the permutation of characters in `chars`. The value of `chars`, `sub`, and other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`**
