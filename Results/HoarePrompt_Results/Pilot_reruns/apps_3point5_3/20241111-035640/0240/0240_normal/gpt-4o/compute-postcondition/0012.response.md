According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are permutations of the characters in `chars` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 2 digits, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation should be generated. This means adjusting the state to consider the next permutation in line.
State: **`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 2 digits, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the next concatenated permutation of the characters in `chars`.**
