Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the concatenated string of all permutations of the characters in `chars`. The variables `chars` and `sub` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is a string representing the concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is a string representing the concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`**
