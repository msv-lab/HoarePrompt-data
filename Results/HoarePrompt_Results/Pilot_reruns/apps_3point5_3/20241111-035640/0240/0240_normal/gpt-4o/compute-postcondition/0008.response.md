According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `chars` and `sub`. If the length of `chars` is greater than the length of `sub`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, `chars` should have more digits added to it. Therefore, the state to adjust is that `chars` should have at least 2 digits.
State: **`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 2 digits, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is the new concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`**
