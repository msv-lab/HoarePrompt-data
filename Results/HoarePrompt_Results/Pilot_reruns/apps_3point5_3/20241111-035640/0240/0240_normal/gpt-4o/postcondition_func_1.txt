The function `is_valid_number` accepts two parameters: `num_str` and `sub`. `num_str` is a string representing a non-negative integer, and `sub` is a substring of `num_str`. The function then checks if `sub` is present in `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`, which should be a non-negative integer. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether these conditions are met. It does not explicitly return the number of digits in `num_str` as indicated in the annotations.
