Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. The function func_1 is supposed to find the smallest possible initial integer n that Vasya could pass to Kate based on the received string and the remembered substring. However, the implementation does not guarantee the smallest possible integer. It simply concatenates the characters from s that are in t_set with the characters in t to form a new integer n.

An example where the code fails is:
Input:
```
003512
021
```
Expected Output:
```
30021
```
Actual Output:
```
30021
```
In this case, the output is correct, but this is not a comprehensive test. The code may fail for other cases where it does not produce the smallest possible initial integer n.
