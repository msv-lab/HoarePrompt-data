The function func_1 accepts two parameters s and t. It iterates through each character in s and appends the character to n if it exists in the set t_set created from t. Then, it concatenates the characters from s that are in t_set with the characters in t and returns the integer representation of this resulting string. If t_set is empty, the function returns 0.
