Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the current character `c`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then the new value of `n` will be the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged. The values of `s`, `t`, and `t_set` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set is a set containing the unique characters of t, n is updated based on the value of c.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s, t_set is a set containing the unique characters of t, n is updated based on the value of c**
