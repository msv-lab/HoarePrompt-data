Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` remain non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` remains a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` remains a non-negative integer between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `min_downvotes + z`**
