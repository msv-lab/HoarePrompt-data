Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` also remain within their respective ranges. If max_downvotes < min_upvotes, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'. In either case, `min_downvotes` is still assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is still equal to `min_downvotes + z`.***
