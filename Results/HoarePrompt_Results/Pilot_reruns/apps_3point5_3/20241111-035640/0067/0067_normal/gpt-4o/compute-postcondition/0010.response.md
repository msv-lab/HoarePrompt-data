The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the preconditions that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function performs a certain operation or returns a specific value based on these preconditions. Since the function does not have any specified return values or operations, the exact functionality cannot be determined without additional information.
