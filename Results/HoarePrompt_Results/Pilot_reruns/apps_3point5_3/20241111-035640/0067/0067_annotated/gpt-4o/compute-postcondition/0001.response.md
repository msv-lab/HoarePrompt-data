Example Answer:
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100 based on the input split and conversion to integers. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is an integer value based on the input.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is an integer value based on the input**
