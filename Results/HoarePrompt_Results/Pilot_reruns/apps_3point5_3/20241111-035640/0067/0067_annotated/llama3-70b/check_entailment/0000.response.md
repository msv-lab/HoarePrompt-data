Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the user input.
- It then follows the logic described in the problem description to determine the result of Nauuo's comment based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes.
- The program handles all possible cases as specified in the problem description and gives the correct output for each case.
- The annotations also align with the logic of the code and describe certain edge cases that the program handles correctly, such as when x is greater than y + z, or when x equals y and z is 0.
- Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and the annotations do not highlight any discrepancies, we can conclude that the program is correct.
