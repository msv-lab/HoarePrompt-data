Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If b equals a, 'YES' is printed. If c is 0, 'NO' is printed. If (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, 'YES' is printed, and `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged within the specified range. If none of the above conditions are met, 'NO' is printed, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.***
