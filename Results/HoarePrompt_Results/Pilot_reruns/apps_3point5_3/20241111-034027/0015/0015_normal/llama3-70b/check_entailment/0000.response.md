Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input, which aligns with the problem description.
- If `c` is 0, the code checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly, which matches the problem description.
- If `c` is not 0, the code verifies if the condition `((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0)` is met, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on that, which also aligns with the problem description.
- The code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
