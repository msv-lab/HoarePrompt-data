Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is 0, then if `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0 and the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. If none of these conditions are met, the program prints 'NO'.***
