The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is met, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on that. The function does not have a specified return value.
