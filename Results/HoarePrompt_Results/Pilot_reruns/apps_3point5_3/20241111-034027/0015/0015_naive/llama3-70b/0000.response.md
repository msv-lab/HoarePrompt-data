Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c=0), then the sequence has to be constant. So if the first element is equal to Vasya's favorite number, then the favorite number appears in the sequence. The code correctly checks for this condition.
- If the difference between any two neighboring elements is not 0 (c!=0), then the sequence can be generated by the formula s_i = a + i * c for i = 0, 1, 2, .... So if Vasya's favorite number b can be expressed as b = a + i * c for some non-negative integer i, then b appears in the sequence. Again, the code correctly checks for this condition.
