Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If b is equal to a, the program prints 'YES'. If c is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If (b - a) % c is equal to 0 and (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0, the program prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'.***
