Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence (b == a), then the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is zero (c == 0), then the program correctly outputs 'NO' since the sequence would not contain Vasya's favorite number.
3. If the favorite number b can be reached by starting from a and adding multiples of c ( (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0), then the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
4. For all other cases, the program correctly outputs 'NO'. 

Therefore, the program covers all potential cases described in the problem statement and produces the correct output.
