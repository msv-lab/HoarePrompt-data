Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes an input string `s` and compares it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character.
2. It iterates through both strings and if a character in `s` matches with the character in the target string, it increments the index for the target string.
3. If all characters in the target string are matched, it prints the target string, otherwise it prints -1.
4. The program correctly handles the case of making the input string a subsequence of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
5. The program works as expected for all potential cases as it iterates through the input string and target string and checks for a matching subsequence.
