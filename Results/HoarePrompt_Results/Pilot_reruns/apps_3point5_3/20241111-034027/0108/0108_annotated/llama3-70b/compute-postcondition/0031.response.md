According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s`. This means that `res` contains more characters from `s` which indicates that the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s`**
