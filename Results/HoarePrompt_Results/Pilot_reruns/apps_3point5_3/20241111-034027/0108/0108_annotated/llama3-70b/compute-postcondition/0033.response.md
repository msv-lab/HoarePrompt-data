Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. The `char` variable is incremented by 1 in the `replace` function. The output state after execution will be: `res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s` with the addition of the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table.
Output State: **`res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s` with the addition of the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table**
