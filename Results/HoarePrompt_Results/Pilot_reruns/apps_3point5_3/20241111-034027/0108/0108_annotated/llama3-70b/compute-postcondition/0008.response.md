Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of 'b' in `s` with the character that comes after 'b' in the ASCII table, which is 'c'. Therefore, `s` is updated with the first occurrence of 'b' replaced by 'c'. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is updated with the first occurrence of 'b' replaced by 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'**
