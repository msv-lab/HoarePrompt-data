According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s` with the addition of the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be a character present in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` includes more characters beyond the current character in `s` with the addition of the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table**
