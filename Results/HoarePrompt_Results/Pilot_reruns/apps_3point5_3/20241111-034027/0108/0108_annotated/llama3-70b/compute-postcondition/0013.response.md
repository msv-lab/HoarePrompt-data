Output State: **If 'a' is present in 's', then after the loop finishes, `s` will contain the first occurrence of 'b', `alphabet` will remain 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` will be 'a... (sequence of all previous chars)', `char` will be 'b'. If 'a' is not present in 's' initially, the loop will not execute and `s`, `alphabet`, `res`, and `char` will remain the same as the initial state. The loop will continue until 'z' is reached or until 'char' is not present in 's' anymore.**
