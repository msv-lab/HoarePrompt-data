Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` containing small English letters. It iterates over the alphabet and replaces each character in the string with the next character in the ASCII sequence. If the resulting string `res` has a length of 26, it prints `res`, otherwise, it prints -1. The function operates on a string `s` with a length between 1 and 10^5.**
