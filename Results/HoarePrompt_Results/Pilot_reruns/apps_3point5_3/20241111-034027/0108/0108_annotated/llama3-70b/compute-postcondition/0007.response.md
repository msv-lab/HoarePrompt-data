Example Answer:
The variable `res` is concatenated with the variable `char`, so the value of `res` changes to 'ab'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is updated with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'.
Output State: **`s` is updated with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'**
