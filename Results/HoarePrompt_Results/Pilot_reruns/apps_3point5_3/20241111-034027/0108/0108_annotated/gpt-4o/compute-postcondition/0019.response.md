Postcondition: ***If the length of string s is less than 26 and contains all the letters of target in order, j will be 26. If s does not contain all the letters of target in order, j will be less than 26 and i will be equal to the length of string s. If the length of string s is greater than or equal to 26, then j will be 26 and i will be equal to the length of string s. After the execution of the if-else block, the program will print the target string if j equals the length of the target string, otherwise it will print -1.***
