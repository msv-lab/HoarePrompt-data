Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a string `s` as input and checks if the letters in `s` are in the same order as the English alphabet. If all letters are in order, it prints out the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If the letters are not in order, it prints -1. The program iterates through the input string and the target alphabet to check if the letters match in order. The annotations provide a clear summary of the program flow and the variables involved, helping to understand how the program works. The examples provided in the problem description are also covered by the program. Therefore, the program is correct in all potential cases.
