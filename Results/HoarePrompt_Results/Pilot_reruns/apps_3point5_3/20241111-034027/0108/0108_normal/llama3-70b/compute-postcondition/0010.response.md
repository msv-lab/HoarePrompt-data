Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char`, where `char` is the next character after the updated value of `char` in the alphabet string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters based on the user input where one character has been replaced; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string containing the next character after `char` in the alphabet string; `char` is the next character after the updated value of `char` in the alphabet string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters based on the user input where one character has been replaced; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string containing the next character after `char` in the alphabet string; `char` is the next character after the updated value of `char` in the alphabet string**
