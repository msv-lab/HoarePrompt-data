Example Answer: 
The value of `char` is added to the `res` string. The `res` string already contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a', and `char` is 'b' or any other character present in the modified `s`. Therefore, after execution, the `res` string will have all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a' and the new character `char` added to it.
Output State: **`s` is modified with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a' and the new character `char`**
