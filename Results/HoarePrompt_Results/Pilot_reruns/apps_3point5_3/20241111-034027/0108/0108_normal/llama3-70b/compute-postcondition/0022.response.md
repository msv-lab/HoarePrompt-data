Example Answer: 
The `char` character in string `s` is replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. The `res` variable contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a' and the new character `char`. Therefore, after execution, the new `s` will have 'b' instead of 'a' and `res` will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a' and the new character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **`s` is modified with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a' and the new character that comes after `char`**
