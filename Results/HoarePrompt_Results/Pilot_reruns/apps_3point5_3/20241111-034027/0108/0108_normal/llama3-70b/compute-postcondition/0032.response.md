Example Answer:

`res` has all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b', `s` has 'b' replaced by 'c', and `char` is the next character after 'b' in the alphabet and is in `s`. After executing the code, `char` is added to `res`, so `res` will now have all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b' and the next character after 'b'. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b' and the next character after 'b, `s` is modified with 'b' replaced by 'c', `char` is the next character after 'b' in the alphabet and char is in `s.
Output State: **`res` contains all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b' and the next character after 'b, `s` is modified with 'b' replaced by 'c', `char` is the next character after 'b' in the alphabet and char is in `s**
