Example Answer: 
The character 'b' in string `s` is replaced by the next character in the alphabet which is 'c' only once. The variable `char` represents the character 'b', so it is replaced by 'c'. The string `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: res contains all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b', s is modified with 'b' replaced by 'c', char is the next character after 'b' in the alphabet.
Output State: **res contains all characters from 'b' to 'z' followed by 'b', s is modified with 'b' replaced by 'c', char is the next character after 'b' in the alphabet**
