Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It takes a string `s` and iterates through the alphabet, replacing each character with the next character in the alphabet if found in `s`. The resulting string is stored in `res`. If `res` contains all the letters from 'a' to 'z', it is printed out. If not, -1 is printed. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correct in its implementation.
