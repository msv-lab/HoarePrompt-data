Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet string. The value of `char` is incremented by 1 using the `ord` and `chr` functions. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters based on the user input where one character has been replaced; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string containing the next character after `char` in the alphabet string; `char` is the next character after `char` in the alphabet string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters based on the user input where one character has been replaced; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string containing the next character after `char` in the alphabet string; `char` is the next character after `char` in the alphabet string**
