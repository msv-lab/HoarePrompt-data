Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number has at most $k$ different digits, and the function `func_2` correctly loops through the range from $l$ to $r$ and adds the numbers that satisfy the condition to the total sum modulo $998244353$. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly implements the logic described. Therefore, the program is correct.
