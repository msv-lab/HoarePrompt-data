Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in a given range. The logic for counting these numbers is implemented accurately, and the modulo operation is applied correctly to handle large inputs. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
