According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `r + 2`, `l` is equal to `r + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be less than or equal to `r + 1`.
State: **`total_sum`, `r`, `l` is equal to `r + 1`, `num` is less than or equal to `r + 1`**
