According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is updated based on the condition of `func_1(num, k)`, `l` is equal to `r + 1`, and `num` is equal to `r + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to `r + 2`.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` is true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (r + 1)) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false, there is no change in `total_sum`. `l` is equal to `r + 1`, and `num` is equal to `r + 2`.**
