Example Answer:
The value of `num` is updated to `r + 2` and `l` is updated to `r + 1`. The value of `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (r + 2)) % MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (r + 2)) % MOD`, `l` is equal to `r + 1`, and `num` is equal to `r + 2`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (r + 2)) % MOD`, `l` is equal to `r + 1`, and `num` is equal to `r + 2`**
