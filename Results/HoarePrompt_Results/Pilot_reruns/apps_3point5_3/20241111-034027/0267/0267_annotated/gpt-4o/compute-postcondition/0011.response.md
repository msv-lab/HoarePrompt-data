Output State: **`total_sum`, `r`, `l`, and `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` is true during any iteration, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The variables `l` and `num` are incremented by 1 in each iteration till `r + 1`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for all iterations, then `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute.**
