Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions. 
- `func_1` checks if a given number `n` has at most `k` different digits. This function accurately represents the condition mentioned in the problem description.
- `func_2` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and checks each number using `func_1`. If a number meets the condition, it adds the number to the total sum. The implementation aligns with the problem description by correctly computing the sum modulo `998244353`.

Overall, the code logic is consistent with the problem statement and handles all potential cases described in the problem description.
