Example Answer:
The function returns the value stored in the dictionary `dp` at the key (n, k). The initial state does not specify the contents of the dictionary, so the output state remains the same. The function does not change the state in any other way.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= n < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. dp is a dictionary used for memoization. If k equals 0, the function returns 0**
