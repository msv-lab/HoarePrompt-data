According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is updated based on the result of `func_1(num, k)`, where `num` is the next number after the current `num`, and the variables `l` and `r` maintain their respective conditions. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to the next number after the current `num`, and `r` needs to be increased by 1 to include the next number in the range.
State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the result of `func_1(num + 1, k)`, `l` remains the same, `r` is increased by 1**
