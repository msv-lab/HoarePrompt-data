Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total_sum`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Since `num` is equal to `l`, the new value of `total_sum` is `(total_sum + l) % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated according to the calculation `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, `l` is a number, `r` is a number greater than or equal to `l`, `num` is equal to `l`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the calculation `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, `l` is a number, `r` is a number greater than or equal to `l`, `num` is equal to `l`**
