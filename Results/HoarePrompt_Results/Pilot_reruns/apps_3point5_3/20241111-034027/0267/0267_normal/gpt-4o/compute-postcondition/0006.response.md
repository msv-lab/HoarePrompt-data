Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is updated based on the result of `func_1(num, k)`, where `num` is the next number after the current `num`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` maintain their respective conditions, with `r` being greater than or equal to `l`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios including edge cases where `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, ensuring the overall state of the program after the if statement execution.***
