According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the range of `num` which is from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0, `l` is a number, `r` is a number greater than or equal to `l`, `num` is equal to `l`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next number in the range from `l` to `r`. So, `num` needs to be incremented to the next number after `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` will be updated as described. No other variables need to be adjusted.

State: **`total_sum` is updated based on `func_1(num, k)`, `l` is the next number after the current `num`, `r` is a number greater than or equal to `l`, `num` is equal to the next number after the current `num`**
