Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is 0, `l` is a number, `r` is a number greater than or equal to `l`, `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, where `l` is a number, `r` is a number greater than or equal to `l`, and `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, no changes are made to the variables.***
