According to the code snippet, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `k-1`, which means the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` needs to be incremented to `k`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values with updated value of `dp[n, k]`, `i` is equal to k, `dp[n, k]` is updated**
