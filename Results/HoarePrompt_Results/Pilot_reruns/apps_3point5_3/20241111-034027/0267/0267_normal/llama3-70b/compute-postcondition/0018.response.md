The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. 

The functionality of the function `count` is as follows:

Case 1: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.

Case 2: If the key `(n, k)` is present in `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key in `dp`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables or the dictionary.

Case 3: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key `(n, k)` is present in `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key in `dp. If `(n, k)` is not present in `dp` and `n` is less than 10, the function does something (not specified).
