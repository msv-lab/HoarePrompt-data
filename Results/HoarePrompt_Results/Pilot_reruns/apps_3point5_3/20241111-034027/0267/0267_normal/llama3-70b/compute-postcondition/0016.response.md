Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key `(n, k)` is present in `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key in `dp`. If `(n, k)` is not present in `dp` and `n` is less than `10 ** k`, `dp` stores the key-value pair `(n, k) = n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `10 ** k`, `dp` stores the key-value pair `(n, k) = 9` initially. Then, a for loop iterates from 1 to `k - 1` to calculate the value stored at `(n, k)` by adding a specific formula. Finally, the value at `(n, k)` is updated by taking the modulo with MOD.***
