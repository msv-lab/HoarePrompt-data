According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer but does not affect the loop execution. `k` is a positive integer, so it satisfies the loop condition. The dictionary `dp` does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values**
