Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the function `func_1` which calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits modulo `998244353`. 
- The function `count` correctly handles the calculation of the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits in the specified range.
- The code structure aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.
- There are no edge cases or potential cases identified where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
- The output hints are consistent with the code logic and provide a detailed explanation of how the functions work to calculate the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits.
