According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values with updated value of `dp[n, k]`, `i` is equal to k**
