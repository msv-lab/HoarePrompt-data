Example Answer:
The value of `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `total_fruits` is the sum of the products of `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` holds the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is the sum of the products of `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` holds the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is the sum of the products of `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4**
