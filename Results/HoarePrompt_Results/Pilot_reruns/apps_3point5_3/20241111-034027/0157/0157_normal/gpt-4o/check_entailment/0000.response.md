Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote by finding the minimum value among the ratio constraints. Then, it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the minimum value by the corresponding ratios. The output is the correct total number of fruits that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. The output hints also align with the code and confirm that the function works as expected.
