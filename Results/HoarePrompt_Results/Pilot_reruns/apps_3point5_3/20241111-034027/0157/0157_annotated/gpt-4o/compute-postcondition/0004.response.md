Example Answer:
`total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4, then summing the results. The value of `max_lemons` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `total_fruits` is dependent on the value of `max_lemons`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `total_fruits` is dependent on the value of `max_lemons`**
