Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are constrained between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the result of the `min` function will be the smallest of these values. 
Output State: **1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the input integer provided by the user, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
