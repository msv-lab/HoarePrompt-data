According to the code, the loop will execute n times based on the value of n. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values with the first element set to `True` after the first iteration, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
