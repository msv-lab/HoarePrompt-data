The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, and `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. Each integer is between 0 and 9 (inclusive). After executing the function body, the function will check if at least one cube face contains each digit in the list `digits`. If all digits are present, all elements in `used_cubes` will be set to True. If any digit is missing in the cube_faces, the function will return False before completion. If `digits` has more elements than the total number of unique digits across all cubes, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and check if all digits in a given list `digits` are present in the cube faces to determine if all cubes can form the number.
