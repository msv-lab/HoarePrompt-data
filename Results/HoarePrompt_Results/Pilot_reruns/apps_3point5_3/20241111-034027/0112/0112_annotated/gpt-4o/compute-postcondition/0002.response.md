According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. If `digits` has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `digits` has at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list. Also, the `used_cubes` list needs to be updated to reflect the state after the loop has executed for the first time.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values with the first element set to `True` after the first iteration**
