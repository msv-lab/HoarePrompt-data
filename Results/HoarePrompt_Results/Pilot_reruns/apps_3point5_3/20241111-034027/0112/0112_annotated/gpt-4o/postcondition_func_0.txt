The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube, such that 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9 for all elements in cubes. The function then iterates to find the smallest integer `x` such that the internal function `can_form_number(x)` returns False. The return value is this smallest `x`. The code updates `x` while `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns True, and the loop continues until it returns False. It keeps `n`, `cubes`, and `cube_faces` unchanged. However, the functionality description lacks clarity on what `can_form_number(x)` actually does.
