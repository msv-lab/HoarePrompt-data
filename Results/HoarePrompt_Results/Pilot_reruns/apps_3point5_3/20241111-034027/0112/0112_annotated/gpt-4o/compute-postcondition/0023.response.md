According to the code, the loop always executes n times, checking each cube face for the presence of the digit. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is described as follows: If `digit` is found in at least one inner list of `cube_faces`, then `found` is True and the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If `digit` is not found in any inner list of `cube_faces`, then `found` remains False and all elements in `used_cubes` remain False.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `digit` being processed in the current iteration needs to be considered. If the current `digit` is found in at least one inner list of `cube_faces`, then `found` should be True for that specific `digit` and the corresponding element in `used_cubes` for that `digit` should be set to True. If the `digit` is not found in any inner list of `cube_faces`, then `found` should remain False and the `used_cubes` for that `digit` should remain False.

Therefore, for the next iteration, the adjustments needed are specific to the `digit` being processed in that iteration based on whether it is found in `cube_faces` or not.
