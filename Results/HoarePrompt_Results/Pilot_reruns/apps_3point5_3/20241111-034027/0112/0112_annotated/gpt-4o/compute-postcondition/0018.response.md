Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the first element is `True` after the first iteration, `found` is `True`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is met, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True and `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the specific cube has been used and found. All variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships.***
