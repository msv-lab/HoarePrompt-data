According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list contains at least 3 sublists, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the next cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must contain at least 3 sublists.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the next cube**
