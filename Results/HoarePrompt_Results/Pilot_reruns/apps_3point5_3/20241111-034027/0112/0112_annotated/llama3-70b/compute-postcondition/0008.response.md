Example Answer:
The set `digits` is updated with the string representations of the digits in each cube in the list `cubes`. This means that for each cube in the list, the string representation of its digits is added to the set `digits`. The values of `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the cubes**
