Example Answer:
The code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains integers separated by spaces. It then creates a list of lists where each sublist contains the integers from each line. The input integer `n` determines the number of lines to be read. Therefore, `n` is an input integer, and the list `cubes` contains sublists of integers based on the input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers**
