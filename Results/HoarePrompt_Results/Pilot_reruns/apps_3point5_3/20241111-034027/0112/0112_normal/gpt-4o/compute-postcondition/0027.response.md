According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more digits left in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more digit left in the list. The `i` is the index of the next cube face to check, so it needs to be adjusted to the index of the next cube face after checking the current digit. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the elements of `used_cubes` are set to True sequentially if they were not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces`, `found` is True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise, `i` is the index of the next cube face to check, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `digits`, `found` is False, `found` is False**
