According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more digits to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the elements of `used_cubes` are set to True sequentially if they were not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces`, `found` is True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise, `i` is the index of the last checked cube face, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `digits`, `found` is False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next digit in the `digits` list needs to be considered. This means incrementing the index `i` to move to the next cube face and updating the `found` state if a digit is found in the next iteration.

State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the elements of `used_cubes` are set to True sequentially if they were not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces`, `found` is True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise, `i` is the index of the next cube face to check, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `digits`, `found` is False**
