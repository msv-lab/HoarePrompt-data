Example Answer:
The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, where `i` is 2. Since the first element of `used_cubes` was set to True if it was not previously True and the condition is met, the output state is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is True, `found` is False, and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is True, `found` is False, and `i` is 2**
