According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `digits` and `n`. If `n` is less than the number of elements in `digits`, the loop will not execute for all values of `i` and the program exits without altering the variables. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the elements of `used_cubes` are set to True sequentially if they were not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces`, `found` is True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise, `i` is the index of the last checked cube face.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of elements in `digits`.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the elements of `used_cubes` are set to True sequentially if they were not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces`, `found` is True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise, `i` is the index of the last checked cube face, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `digits`**
