Example Answer: 
The element at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list is set to `True`. Since `i` is 0 initially, after execution, the first element of `used_cubes` is set to `True`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` has the first element set to `True`, `found` is False, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` has the first element set to `True`, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
