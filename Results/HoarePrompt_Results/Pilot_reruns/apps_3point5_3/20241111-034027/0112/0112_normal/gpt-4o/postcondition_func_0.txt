Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `cubes`. It creates a list of sets `cube_faces` from the input cubes. The while loop inside the function depends on the implementation of `can_form_number` and may not execute at all or run indefinitely. The variable `x` is either 0 or continuously increasing. The function returns the current value of `x`. The actual behavior of the function may vary based on the implementation of `can_form_number`.
