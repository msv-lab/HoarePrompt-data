Output State: **The loop iterates over each digit in `digits` and checks if it can be found in any of the cube faces. If a digit is found in a cube face that hasn't been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a digit cannot be found, the loop returns False. The loop continues until all digits are checked or one is not found in any cube face.**
