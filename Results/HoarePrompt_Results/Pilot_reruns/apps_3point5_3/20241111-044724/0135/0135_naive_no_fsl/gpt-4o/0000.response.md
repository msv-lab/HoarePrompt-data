Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of the remainders that have been seen before. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k and if it finds a remainder that has already been seen, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and the provided examples.
