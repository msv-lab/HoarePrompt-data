Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- It iterates from 1 to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and storing unique remainders in a set `seen`.
- If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits.
- If no repeated remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'.
- The code accurately follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as described.
