Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the modulus of `n` divided by `i`, where `n` and `i` are both integers. Since `i` is 3, the value of `remainder` will be the remainder of `n` divided by 3. The updated value of `remainder` is not in the `seen` set. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the updated value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, and the updated value of `remainder` is not in the `seen` set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the updated value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, and the updated value of `remainder` is not in the `seen` set**
