The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It then iterates from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i and storing unique remainders in a set `seen`. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits. If no repeated remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not explicitly return a value.
