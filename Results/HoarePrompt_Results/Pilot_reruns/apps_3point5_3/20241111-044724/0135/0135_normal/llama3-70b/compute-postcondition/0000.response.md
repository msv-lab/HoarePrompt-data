Example Answer:
n and k are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input, where both n and k are integers. The values of n and k are between 1 and 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
