Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, ensuring that `n > k`. 
- Case 1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- Case 2: If `k` is less than `n`, the function checks for unique remainders of `n` divided by `i` where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`. If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. If no duplicates are found, the function returns 'Yes'.
Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine if there are any duplicate remainders when `n` is divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, returning 'Yes' if there are none, and 'No' if duplicates are present.**
