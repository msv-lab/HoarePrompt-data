Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is greater than `i` and `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is calculated and stored in `remainder`. The value of `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that n > k, k is an integer between 1 and 10^18, i is 2, remainder is the result of n % 2.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that n > k, k is an integer between 1 and 10^18, i is 2, remainder is the result of n % 2**
