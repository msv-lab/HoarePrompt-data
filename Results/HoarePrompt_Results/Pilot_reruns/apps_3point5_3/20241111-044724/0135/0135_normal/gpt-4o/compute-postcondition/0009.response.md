According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that n > k, k is between 1 and 10^18, i is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n and k are integers such that n > k, k is an integer between 1 and 10^18, i is 3, remainder is the result of n % 2**
