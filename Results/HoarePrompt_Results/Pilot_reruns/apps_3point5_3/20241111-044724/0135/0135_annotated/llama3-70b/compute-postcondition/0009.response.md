Example Answer:
The remainder is calculated by taking the modulus of `n` divided by `i`, where `i` is `k + 1`. The set `seen` contains the added `remainder` value. The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the added `remainder` value from the calculation, `i` is adjusted to `k + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the added `remainder` value, `i` is adjusted to `k + 1**
