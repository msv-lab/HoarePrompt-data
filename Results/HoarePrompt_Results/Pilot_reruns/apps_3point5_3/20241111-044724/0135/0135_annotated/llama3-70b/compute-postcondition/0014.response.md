According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the added `remainder` value, and `i` is adjusted to `k`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the added `remainder` value, `i` is adjusted to `k + 1**
