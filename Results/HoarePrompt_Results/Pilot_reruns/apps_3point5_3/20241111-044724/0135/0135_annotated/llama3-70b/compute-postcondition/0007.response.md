Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. If the value of `remainder` is already in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the state remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the added `remainder` value.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the added `remainder` value**
