Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, then iterates through integers from 1 to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each integer. If a remainder is already in the set `seen`, it prints 'No' and exits. If not, it adds the remainder to the set. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if all remainders are distinct.

The code annotations provide a clear explanation of the code's functionality, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the annotations mention that the loop will execute at least once if `k` is greater than or equal to 1, which is correct. The annotations also summarize the overall functionality of the function accurately. Since the code and annotations are consistent with the problem description and cover all potential cases, the correctness of the code is true.
