The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ n. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.

Case_2: If k is greater than 0, the loop will execute k times. After the loop executes, `seen_remainders` will contain all unique remainders of n divided by numbers from 1 to k. If at any point a previously seen remainder is encountered, the loop will return 'No'. If k is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `seen_remainders` will remain an empty set.

Case_3: If k is greater than 0, the loop will execute k times. After the loop executes, `seen_remainders` will contain all unique remainders of n divided by numbers from 1 to k. If at any point a previously seen remainder is encountered, the loop will return 'No'. If k is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `seen_remainders` will remain an empty set.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints and return 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n, or based on the unique remainders of n divided by numbers from 1 to k.
