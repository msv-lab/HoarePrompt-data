Example Answer:
The function returns two values, `block` and `floor`. The values of `block` and `floor` are calculated based on the provided formula. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are given, and the formula for `floor` is applied to calculate its value. The exact values of `block` and `floor` will depend on the input values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is `n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`, and the function returns calculated values for `block` and `floor`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`, and the function returns calculated values for `block` and `floor`**
