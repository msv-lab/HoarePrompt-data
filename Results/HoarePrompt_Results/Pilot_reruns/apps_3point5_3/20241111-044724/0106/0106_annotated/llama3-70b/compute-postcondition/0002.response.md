Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. Given that `a` and `m` are assigned integers from user input, the value of `a_floor` will be a positive integer within the specified constraints based on the formula provided. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers within the specified constraints, `a_floor` is a positive integer calculated based on the formula provided**
