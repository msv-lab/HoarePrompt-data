Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time` are unchanged. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor` multiplied by 5 plus 10. If `b_floor` is greater than or equal to `a_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `b_floor` and `a_floor` multiplied by 5 plus 10. This ensures that the minimum time to travel between the floors is correctly calculated in all scenarios, accounting for the edge cases where the floors are equal or the order of floors is reversed.***
