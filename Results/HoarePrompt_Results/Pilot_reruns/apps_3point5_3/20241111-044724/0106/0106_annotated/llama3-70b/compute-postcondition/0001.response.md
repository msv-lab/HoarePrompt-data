Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the user input after splitting the input by spaces. The values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: `a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers within the specified constraints.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers within the specified constraints**
