Example Answer:
The function returns the values of `block` and `floor`. The values of `block` and `floor` are calculated based on the initial state of the program. Therefore, the output state is `floor` is calculated based on `floor_within_block`, `k`, and `block`.
Output State: **`floor` is calculated based on `floor_within_block`, `k`, and `block`**
