Example Answer:
`b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `b`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. The value of `b_block` depends on the values of `b`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is a positive integer, `b_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `b_block` is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is a positive integer, `b_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `b_block` is calculated based on the given formula**
