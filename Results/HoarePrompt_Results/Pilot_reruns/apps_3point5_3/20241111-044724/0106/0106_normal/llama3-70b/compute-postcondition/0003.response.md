Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `a` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, and `k` is a positive integer, so the value of `a_block` will be a positive integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is a positive integer**
