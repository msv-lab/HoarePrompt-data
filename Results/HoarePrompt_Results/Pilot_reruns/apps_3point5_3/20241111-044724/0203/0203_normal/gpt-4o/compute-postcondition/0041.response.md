Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` followed by a string `votes` representing votes for the Democratic ('D') and Republican ('R') parties. It then processes the votes by simulating a voting process where the party with the earlier index in the string wins. The function prints the winning party ('D' for Democratic or 'R' for Republican) based on the simulated voting process.**
