Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is appended to the `d_queue`. Initially, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list, `votes` list has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first element in the `votes` list. After executing the code, `i` is added to `d_queue`, so `d_queue` will contain the value 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` contains 0, `r_queue` is an empty list, `votes` list has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `v` is the first element in the `votes` list.
Output State: **`d_queue` contains 0, `r_queue` is an empty list, `votes` list has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `v` is the first element in the `votes` list**
