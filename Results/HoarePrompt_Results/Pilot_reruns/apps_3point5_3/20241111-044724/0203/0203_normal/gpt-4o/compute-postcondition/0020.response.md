Example Answer:
A value is appended to `d_queue` by adding `d_index` and `n`. The state of `d_queue` changes as it now has one more element. The state of `r_queue` and `votes` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining with the new appended value, `r_queue` is modified, `votes` is unchanged**
