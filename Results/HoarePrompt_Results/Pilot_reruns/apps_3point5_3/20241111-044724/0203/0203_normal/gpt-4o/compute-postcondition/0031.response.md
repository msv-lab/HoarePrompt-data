Example Answer:
The value at index 0 from `r_queue` is removed and assigned to `r_index`. The state of `d_queue`, `votes`, and `d_index` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` has been updated to the popped element, `r_index` contains the value popped from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` has been updated to the popped element, `r_index` contains the value popped from `r_queue`**
