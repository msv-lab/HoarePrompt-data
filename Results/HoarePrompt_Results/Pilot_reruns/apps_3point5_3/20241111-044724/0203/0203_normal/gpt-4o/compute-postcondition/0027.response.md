Example Answer:
The value of `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. The state of `d_queue` remains the same, `r_queue` is modified by adding the value of `r_index + n`, and `votes` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified by adding the value of `r_index + n`, `votes` remain unchanged**
