Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` is modified by removing the first element, `r_queue` remains unchanged, `votes` remain unchanged, and `d_index` is updated to the popped element. 
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` has been updated to the popped element**
