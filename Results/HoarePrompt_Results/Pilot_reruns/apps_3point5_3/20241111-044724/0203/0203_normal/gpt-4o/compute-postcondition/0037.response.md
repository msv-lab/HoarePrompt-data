Output State: **Since the provided Python code snippet only prints 'D' and does not involve any variable manipulation, the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state where both d_queue and r_queue are initially non-empty, and the loop will continue until one of them becomes empty. After each iteration, d_index and r_index are updated based on the popped values from d_queue and r_queue respectively. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue is appended with d_index + n, otherwise r_queue is appended with r_index + n. The loop will stop when either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty.**
