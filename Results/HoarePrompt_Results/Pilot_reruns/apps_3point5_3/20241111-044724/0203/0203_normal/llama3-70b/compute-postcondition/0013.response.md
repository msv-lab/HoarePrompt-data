Example Answer: 
The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state is not provided, we can assume that `depublicans` had a value before the increment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element with the next fraction in line, and `depublicans` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element with the next fraction in line, `depublicans` is incremented by 1**
