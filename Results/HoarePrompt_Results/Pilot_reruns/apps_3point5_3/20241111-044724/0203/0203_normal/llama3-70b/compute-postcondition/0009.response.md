Example Answer: 
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. Since the next fraction is 'D', `depublicans` will be incremented by 1 and `remocrats` will remain 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element, depublicans is incremented by 1, and remocrats remains 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element, depublicans is incremented by 1, and remocrats remains 0**
