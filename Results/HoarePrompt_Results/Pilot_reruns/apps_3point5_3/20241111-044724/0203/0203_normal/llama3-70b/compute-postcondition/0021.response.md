The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. The parameter constraints specify that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and the characters in the input string represent the fraction of each employee, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats. The function is expected to process this input data to determine the fraction of depublicans and remocrats among the employees. However, it is not explicitly mentioned how the input string is provided to the function, so the method of input is not specified.

Functionality: **The function processes the input string representing the fraction of depublicans and remocrats among employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats, to determine the respective fractions.**
