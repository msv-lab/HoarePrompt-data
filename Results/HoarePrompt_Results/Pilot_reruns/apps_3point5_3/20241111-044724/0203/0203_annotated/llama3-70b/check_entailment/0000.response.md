Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input of the number of employees and their fractions, calculates the count of depublicans and remocrats, and prints 'D' if there are more depublicans, 'R' if there are more remocrats, and 'R' if they are equal. The code considers the process of employees making statements and denying others the right to vote until only one employee is left to determine the outcome. The annotations provide a summary of the code logic, and upon reviewing both the code and the annotations, it is evident that the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Thus, the correctness of the code is True.
