According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 2 fractions, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the next fraction in the list. If the next fraction is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1. If the next fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 fractions and the next fraction should be available.
State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 2 fractions, `fraction` is the next fraction in the list. If the next fraction is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1. If the next fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is increased by 1**
