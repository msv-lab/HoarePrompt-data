Output State: **If either d_queue or r_queue is empty at the start of the loop, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, after the loop finishes executing, the values in d_queue and r_queue will be rearranged based on the comparisons between d_index and r_index. If d_index < r_index, a new element will be added to d_queue with a value of d_index + n, and d_index will be updated accordingly. If d_index is not less than r_index, a new element will be added to r_queue with a value of r_index + n, and r_index will be updated to the value popped from the front of r_queue. The loop will continue until either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty. If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not start.**
