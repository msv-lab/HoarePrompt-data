Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `d_queue`. The initial state does not provide any information about the contents of `d_queue` or the value of `i`, so after execution, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', index of the last character processed in the previous iteration is less than n-1, `d_queue` contains the appended value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', index of the last character processed in the previous iteration is less than n-1, `d_queue` contains the appended value of `i`**
