Example Answer: 
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` has at least one element, `d_index` will now hold the value that was at the front of the queue. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` both have at least one element, `d_index` is updated with a new value from the front of `d_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` both have at least one element, `d_index` is updated with a new value from the front of `d_queue`**
