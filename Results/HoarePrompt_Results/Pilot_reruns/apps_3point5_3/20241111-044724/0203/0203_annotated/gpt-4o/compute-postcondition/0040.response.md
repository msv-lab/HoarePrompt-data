The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it utilizes the constraints provided: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The function calculates and returns the winner of an election based on the votes received. The winner is determined by which party, 'D' (Democrats) or 'R' (Republicans), has the most votes in the string. If there is a tie in the number of votes, the function returns "Tie". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the winner of an election based on the votes received, handling tie scenarios as well.
