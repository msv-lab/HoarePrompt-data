According to the code, the loop can execute if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop executed successfully, so we need to repeat the same state to allow the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty.**
