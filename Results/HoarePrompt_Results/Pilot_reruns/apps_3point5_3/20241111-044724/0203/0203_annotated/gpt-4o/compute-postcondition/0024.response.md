Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` is guaranteed to be not empty, the value popped from `d_queue` is valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`**
