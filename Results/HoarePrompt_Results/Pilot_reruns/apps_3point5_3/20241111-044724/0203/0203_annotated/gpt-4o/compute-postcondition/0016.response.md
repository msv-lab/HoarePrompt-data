According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the `votes` string to process. At the end of the last iteration, the index of the last character processed is less than n-1. To execute one more time, the next character needs to be processed. If the next character is 'D', the value of `i+1` should be appended to the `d_queue`, and if the next character is 'R', the length of `r_queue` should be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', index of the last character processed in the previous iteration is less than n-1, next character should be processed**
