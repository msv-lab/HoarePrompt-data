Example Answer:
The list `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `n` and `votes` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list**
