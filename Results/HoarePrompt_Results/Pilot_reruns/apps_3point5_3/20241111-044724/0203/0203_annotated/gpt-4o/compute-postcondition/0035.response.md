According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the state is described as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
- `d_index` is less than `r_index`.
- `r_queue` contains the value `r_index + n`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- Since `d_index` was less than `r_index` at the end of the last iteration, `d_index` should be updated to `d_index + n`.
- A new element should be added to `d_queue` with the value `d_index + n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_index` is updated to `d_index + n` and a new element is added to `d_queue` with the value `d_index + n`; `r_queue` contains the value `r_index + n`.**
