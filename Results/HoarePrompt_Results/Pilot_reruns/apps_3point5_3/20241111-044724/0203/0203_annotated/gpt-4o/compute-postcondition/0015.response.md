Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', index of the last character processed in the previous iteration is less than n-1. If the character `v` is 'D', the value of `i` is appended to the `d_queue`. If the character `v` is 'R', the length of `r_queue` is increased by 1.***
