Example Answer:
The variable `votes` is assigned the input value after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The input consists of a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
