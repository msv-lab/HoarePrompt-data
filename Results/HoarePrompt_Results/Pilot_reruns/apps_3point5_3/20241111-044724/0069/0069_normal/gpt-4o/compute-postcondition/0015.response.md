Output State: **`data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `_` is 1, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`, `s` is a string value extracted from `data` at index `index + 2`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string up to that index, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4, the length of `prefix_balances` is `(n + 1)`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
