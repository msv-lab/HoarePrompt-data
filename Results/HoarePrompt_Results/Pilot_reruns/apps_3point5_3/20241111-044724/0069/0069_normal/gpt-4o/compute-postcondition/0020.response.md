Example Answer:
The code appends -1 to the list `results`. The list `results` is updated with the new value -1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string up to that index, `results` contains the newly appended value -1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string up to that index, `results` contains the newly appended value -1**
