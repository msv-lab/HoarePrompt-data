Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also agree that the code is incorrect.

The main issue lies in the logic of checking if the balance is present in the cumulative sum of the prefixes. This logic is flawed and does not cover all cases as required by the problem description. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where there might be an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance.

Therefore, the code needs to be revised to accurately count the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x and handle cases where there might be an infinite number of such prefixes.
