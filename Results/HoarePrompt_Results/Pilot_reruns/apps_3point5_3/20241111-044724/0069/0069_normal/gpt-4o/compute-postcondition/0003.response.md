Example Answer: 
The variable `index` is assigned the value 1. Since `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces and `T` is an integer, the values of `data` and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `T` is an integer, `index` is 1.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `T` is an integer, `index` is 1**
