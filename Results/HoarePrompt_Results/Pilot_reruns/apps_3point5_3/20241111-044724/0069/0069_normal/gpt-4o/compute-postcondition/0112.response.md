Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data consisting of multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `x`, and a binary string `s`. It then performs calculations based on the input constraints and conditions. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the binary string `s` up to a certain index. It then determines if `x` is present in the calculated cumulative sum and appends the result to the `results` list. Finally, it prints the results for each test case. The function handles cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than or equal to 1, ensuring that the loop executes properly and results are printed accordingly.**
