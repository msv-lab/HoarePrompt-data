Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables are updated as follows: `prefix_balances` list is modified based on the provided formula, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is computed, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `balance` equals 0, the `results` list appends either -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances` or 0 otherwise. In case `balance` is not 0, `prefix_balances` maintains at least n elements, `b` represents the nth element in `prefix_balances`, and `count` is the count of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0. This postcondition encompasses all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring a comprehensive overview of the program state after the if-else block execution.***
