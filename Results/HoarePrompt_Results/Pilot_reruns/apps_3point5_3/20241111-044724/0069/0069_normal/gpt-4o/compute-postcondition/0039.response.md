Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned as an integer based on the value at `data[index + 1]`. The variables `prefix_balances` and `results` remain unchanged. The value of `count` depends on the conditions, and `T` is greater than the current iteration count.
Output State: **`n` is an integer based on the value at `data[index]`, `prefix_balances` and `results` remain unchanged, `count` depends on the conditions, and `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `x` is assigned an integer based on the value at `data[index + 1]`**
