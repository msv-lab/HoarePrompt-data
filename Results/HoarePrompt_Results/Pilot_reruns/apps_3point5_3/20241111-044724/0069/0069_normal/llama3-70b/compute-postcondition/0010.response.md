Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0`, the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. This covers all scenarios, including the edge cases where the denominator of the division is zero, ensuring a comprehensive output based on the input values.***
