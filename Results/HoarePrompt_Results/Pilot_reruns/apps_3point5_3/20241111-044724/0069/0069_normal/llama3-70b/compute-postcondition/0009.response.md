Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0`, the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. This covers all possible cases including the edge cases where the denominator of the division is zero.***
