Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string.
2. It calculates the balance of the given string correctly by counting the number of 0s and 1s.
3. It then checks three conditions:
   a. If the balance is equal to the desired balance, it prints the length of the string + 1.
   b. If the difference between the desired balance and the current balance is divisible by the difference between the count of 0s and 1s, it prints -1.
   c. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes needed to reach the desired balance and prints that value.
4. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
