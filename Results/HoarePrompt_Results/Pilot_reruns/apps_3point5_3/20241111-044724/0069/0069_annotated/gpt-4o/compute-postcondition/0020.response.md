Example Answer:
The code appends -1 to the `results` list, `results` being a list. The loop mentioned in the initial state is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop executes, `prefix_balances` will store the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros. `results` contains -1.
