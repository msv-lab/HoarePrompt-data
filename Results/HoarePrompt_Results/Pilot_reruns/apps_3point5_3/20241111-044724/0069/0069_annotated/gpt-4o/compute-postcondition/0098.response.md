Output State: **`count` is an integer. If `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in the list. If the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. If `prefix_balances` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.**
