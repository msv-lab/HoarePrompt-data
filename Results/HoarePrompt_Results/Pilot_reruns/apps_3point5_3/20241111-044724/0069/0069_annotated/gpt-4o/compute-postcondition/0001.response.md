Example Answer:
The `input()` function accepts user input, which is then split into a list `data`. The list `data` will contain the input values. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer. For each test case, n is a positive integer, x is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, and s is a binary string of length n.
Output State: **T is a positive integer. For each test case, n is a positive integer, x is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, and s is a binary string of length n.**
