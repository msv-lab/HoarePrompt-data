Output State: **If n is greater than 0 and balance is not 0, the loop will execute and print each element in the results list. If balance is 0, prefix_balances will remain unchanged, and results will contain -1 if x is in prefix_balances; otherwise, results will contain 0. If balance is not 0, prefix_balances will store the cumulative sum of the balance, and count will be the number of elements in prefix_balances satisfying the condition. results will have an additional element with the value of count. If prefix_balances is empty, the loop does not execute, and count remains 0.**
