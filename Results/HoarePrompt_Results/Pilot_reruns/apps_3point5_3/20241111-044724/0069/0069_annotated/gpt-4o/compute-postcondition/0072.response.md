Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is unknown, and `data` is a list, so `s` will be assigned the value of the element in the list at index `index + 2`. The value of `n` and `x` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list, `index` is an index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`**
