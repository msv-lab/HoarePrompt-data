Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of elements and `index` is 1. The value at index 1 in the list `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` has a capacity of at least T elements, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the list `data`**
