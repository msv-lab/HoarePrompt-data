Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One issue is with the line `if x in prefix_balances`, which checks for the exact value of `x` in `prefix_balances` instead of considering the sum of integers. This could lead to incorrect results for cases where the sum of integers is equal to `x` but not the exact value. 

Additionally, the code does not explicitly handle cases where the division by `balance` results in a floating-point number, which could lead to incorrect results. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
