According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list, `results` is a list, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` satisfying the condition, `prefix_balances` is not empty. To execute the loop one more time, the `results` list must have at least one more element.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list, `results` is a list with at least one more element, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` satisfying the condition, `prefix_balances` is not empty**
