Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of balance calculated for each element in the `s` list with even more elements, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of balance calculated for each element in the `s` list with even more elements, `count` is increased by 1**
