Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes and updates `prefix_balances` based on the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list. The `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` appends -1; otherwise, it appends 0. The `index` is increased by 3 after the loop. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of `(n + 1)`. In all cases, the program remains consistent with the initial conditions stated in the precondition.***
