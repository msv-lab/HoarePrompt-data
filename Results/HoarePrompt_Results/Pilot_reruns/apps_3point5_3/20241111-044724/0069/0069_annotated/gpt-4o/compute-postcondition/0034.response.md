Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one element, `count` is an integer where it is incremented by 1 if (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0. The value of `b` remains unchanged. If the list `prefix_balances` is empty, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.**
