Output State: **After the loop executes, `prefix_balances` will store the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros.**
