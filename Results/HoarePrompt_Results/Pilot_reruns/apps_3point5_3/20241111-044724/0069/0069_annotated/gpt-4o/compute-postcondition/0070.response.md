Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is the index provided. The value at the specified index is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `data` is a list, `index` is an index, `n` is an integer.
Output State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an index, `n` is an integer**
