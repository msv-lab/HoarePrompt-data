According to the code, the loop will execute T number of times, where T is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, T is already a positive integer and index is 1. Additionally, since results is an empty list, it needs to have enough capacity to hold T elements after the loop finishes. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `results` has a capacity of at least T elements.
State: **T is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` has a capacity of at least T elements**
