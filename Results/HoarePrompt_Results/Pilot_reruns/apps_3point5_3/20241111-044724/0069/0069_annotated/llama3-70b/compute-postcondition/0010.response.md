Postcondition: ***`T` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is a string from input, `cnt0` contains the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` contains the count of '1' characters in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. The postcondition accounts for all possible scenarios, including the edge cases where the denominator in the division is 0 or the result is an integer.***
