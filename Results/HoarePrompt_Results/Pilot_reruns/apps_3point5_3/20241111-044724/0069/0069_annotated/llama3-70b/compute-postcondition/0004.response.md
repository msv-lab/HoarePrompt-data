Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' characters in the string `s` respectively. The initial state consists of non-negative integer `T`, input integers `n` and `x`, and a string `s`. After execution, `cnt0` will hold the count of '0' characters in `s`, and `cnt1` will hold the count of '1' characters in `s`. 
Output State: **`T` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string from input, `cnt0` contains the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` contains the count of '1' characters in `s`**
