Example Answer: 
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since `a` is a list of distinct positive integers, sorting it will arrange the integers in increasing order. The size of the list `a` remains the same, but the order of its elements is changed. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.**
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.**
