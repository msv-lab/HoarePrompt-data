Output State: **If the assigned set is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, can_form will be True if there exists x in assigned such that a[i] - x is also in assigned. The assigned set will contain a[i+1] and all previous elements that lead to setting can_form to True. If can_form is False, then `m` is incremented by 1.**
