Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input of the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `a`.
- It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
- The code initializes a set called `assigned` to keep track of the integers that can be formed using the variables.
- It then iterates through the sorted list `a` and checks if the current element minus any previous element in the `assigned` set is also present in the `assigned` set.
- If not, it increments the variable `m` indicating the need for an additional variable.
- Finally, it returns the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the operations based on the input sequence of distinct integers. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming that it is implemented as described in the problem statement.
