Postcondition: ***At the end of the if statement, `assigned` is a set containing `a[i+2]`, `can_form` is True, `assigned` is not empty, and `x` is the second element in the `assigned` set. If `a[i] - x` is found in the `assigned` set, `can_form` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken. This covers all the possible scenarios where the loop executes for each element in the `assigned` set and the necessary conditions are met for the if statement to be true.***
