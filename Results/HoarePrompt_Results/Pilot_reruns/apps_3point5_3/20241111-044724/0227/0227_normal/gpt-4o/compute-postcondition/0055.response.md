Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable, `m` is not incremented. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is True, and the loop is terminated. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, no changes occur. The `assigned` list has at least one more element after `x` is removed, and the new `x` is the first element in the adjusted `assigned` list.***
