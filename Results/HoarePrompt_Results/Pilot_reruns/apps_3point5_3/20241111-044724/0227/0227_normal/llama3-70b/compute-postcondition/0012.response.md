Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. If `a[i]` is not equal to twice `a[i - 1]`, then `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being 4 and `i` remaining as 2. This check ensures that the list `a` maintains the property of having consecutive elements differ by a factor of 2.***
