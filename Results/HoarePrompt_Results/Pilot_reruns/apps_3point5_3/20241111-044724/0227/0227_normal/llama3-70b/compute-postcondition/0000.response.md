Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23**
