Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of variables m needed to perform the described sequence of operations. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not follow the problem description accurately.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3
3 6 5

Expected Output:
-1

Actual Output:
2

In this case, the program should output -1 as it is not possible to perform the described sequence of operations with any number of variables. However, the program incorrectly outputs 2.
