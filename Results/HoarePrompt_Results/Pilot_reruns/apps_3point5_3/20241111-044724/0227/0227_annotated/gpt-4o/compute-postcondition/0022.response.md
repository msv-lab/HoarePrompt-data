Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty and has additional elements, `m` is 2, `i` is either 1 or 2, `can_form` is True if the condition is met, `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop checks if the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the first element in `assigned` exists in the `assigned` list. If the condition is met, `can_form` is set to True, and the loop breaks. After the loop execution, `m` is 2.**
