Correctness: False

The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations state that the function iterates over the elements in list `a`, checking if each element can be formed by subtracting any previous element in the list. However, the problem description requires that the value assigned in each operation must be equal to the sum of values stored in two variables, not the result of subtraction.

Additionally, the code does not consider the case where it is impossible to form the sequence of operations with any number of variables. For example, if the input sequence is [3, 6, 5], the code will incorrectly return 2 instead of -1.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
