Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The list `a` originally contained `n` distinct positive integers, and after sorting, it still contains the same `n` distinct positive integers but in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order**.
