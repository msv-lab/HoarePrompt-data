Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two parameters: a positive integer n and a list a of distinct positive integers. It iterates over the elements in a, checking if each element can be formed by subtracting any previous element in the list. It then returns the count of how many elements in a cannot be formed by subtraction. If the list a is empty, the function returns 0. **
