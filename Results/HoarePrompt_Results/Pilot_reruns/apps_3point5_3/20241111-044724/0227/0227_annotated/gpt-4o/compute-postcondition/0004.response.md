According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute. However, the initial value of `i` is 1 and the loop starts from 1, so `i` needs to start from 1 for the loop to execute. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
