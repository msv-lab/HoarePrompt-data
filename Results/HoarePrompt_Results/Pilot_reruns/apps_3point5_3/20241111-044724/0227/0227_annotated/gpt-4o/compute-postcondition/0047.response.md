Postcondition: ***If the new element in `assigned` can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True. The values of `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, and `x` remain as described in the precondition. Additionally, the loop or if statement is exited after setting `can_form` to True.***
