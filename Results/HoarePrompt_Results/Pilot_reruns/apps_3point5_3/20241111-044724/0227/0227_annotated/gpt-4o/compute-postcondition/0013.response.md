Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True, and the loop is broken.***
