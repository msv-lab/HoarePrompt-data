Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False and the loop continues.***
