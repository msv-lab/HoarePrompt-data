According to the code, the loop will only execute if the `assigned` list is not empty. Since `assigned` contains the smallest element of list `a`, it is assumed that the list is not empty. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the first element in `assigned`**
