Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values inputted after converting them to integers using the `map` function and splitting the input. The list `a` now contains the distinct positive integers entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers**
