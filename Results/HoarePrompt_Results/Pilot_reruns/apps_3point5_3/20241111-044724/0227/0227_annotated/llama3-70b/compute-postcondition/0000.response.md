Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers. Therefore, the output state is: **n is a positive integer. The sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers.**
Output State: **n is a positive integer. The sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers.**
