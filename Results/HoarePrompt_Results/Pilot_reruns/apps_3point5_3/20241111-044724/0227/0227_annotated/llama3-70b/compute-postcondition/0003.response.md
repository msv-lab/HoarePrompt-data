Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the value 1. The value of `m` is now 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 1**
