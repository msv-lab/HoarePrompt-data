Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The sequence of positive integers in list `a` remains the same but they are now sorted. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
