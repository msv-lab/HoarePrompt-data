According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 4, i is 3. If a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1] multiplied by 2, then m is incremented by 1. Otherwise, m remains unchanged.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted. Since `i` is currently 3, it should be incremented by 1 to become 4 for the loop to execute again. No other states need adjustment.
State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 4, i is 4**
