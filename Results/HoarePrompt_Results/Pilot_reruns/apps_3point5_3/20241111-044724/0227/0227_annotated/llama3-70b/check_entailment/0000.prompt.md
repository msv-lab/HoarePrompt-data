You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got a positive integer sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. All numbers in the sequence are distinct. Let's fix the set of variables b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}. Initially each variable b_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ m) contains the value of zero. Consider the following sequence, consisting of n operations.

The first operation is assigning the value of a_1 to some variable b_{x} (1 ≤ x ≤ m). Each of the following n - 1 operations is assigning to some variable b_{y} the value that is equal to the sum of values that are stored in the variables b_{i} and b_{j} (1 ≤ i, j, y ≤ m). At that, the value that is assigned on the t-th operation, must equal a_{t}. For each operation numbers y, i, j are chosen anew.

Your task is to find the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 23). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that all numbers in the sequence are distinct.


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single number — the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.

If you cannot perform the sequence of operations at any m, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 6 8

Output
2

Input
3
3 6 5

Output
-1

Input
6
2 4 8 6 10 18

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample, you can use two variables b_1 and b_2 to perform the following sequence of operations.  b_1 := 1;  b_2 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2;  b_1 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    #State of the program here: n is a positive integer. The sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers.
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    #State of the program here: n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers
    a.sort()
    #State of the program here: n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order
    m = 1
    #State of the program here: n is a positive integer, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2:
            m += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is greater than 1 and the list a has at least 2 elements, the loop will iterate through the list and increment m by 1 for each element that does not follow the pattern a[i] = 2 * a[i-1]. After the loop, m will represent the number of elements in the list a that do not follow this pattern. If n is 1 or the list a has only 1 element, the loop will not execute and m will remain 1.
    print(m if m <= 23 else -1)
    #State of the program here: If n is greater than 1 and a has at least 2 elements, m will represent the number of elements in a that do not follow the pattern a[i] = 2 * a[i-1]. If n is 1 or a has only 1 element, m will remain 1. Then, print m if m is less than or equal to 23, otherwise print -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an input integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` in ascending order and then iterates through the list to count the elements that do not follow the pattern where an element is twice the previous element. If `n` is greater than 1 and `a` has at least 2 elements, it prints the count `m` of such elements. If `m` is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not account for the case where `n` is less than 1 or `a` is an empty list.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
