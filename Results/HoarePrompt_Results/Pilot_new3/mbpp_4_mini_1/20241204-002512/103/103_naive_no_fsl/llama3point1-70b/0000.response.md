Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` seems to be intended to calculate some geometric property related to a cylinder, but there is a significant issue: it does not import the `math` module, which is necessary for using `math.pi`. 

Additionally, the name of the function (`func_1`) and the parameters (`radius`, `height`) imply that it might be intended to compute the volume or surface area of a cylinder, but the formula used (`2 * math.pi * radius * height`) actually computes the lateral surface area of a cylinder, which may not align with the expected output based on common interpretations of such parameters.

1. **Missing import**: The function will raise a `NameError` because `math` is not defined unless imported.
2. **Potential misinterpretation**: If the intention was to compute volume or surface area, the formula used is incorrect for those calculations.

Because of these issues, particularly the fact that the function will fail to run due to missing the import statement, the function does not work as expected for at least one potential case.
