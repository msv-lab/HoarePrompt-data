Correctness: **False**

The program does not provide any problem description, making it impossible to determine the intended functionality. The function `func_1(radius, height)` calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder given its radius and height. However, without clear specifications from a problem description, it cannot be verified if this is indeed the desired outcome.

Furthermore, there are multiple potential issues:
1. The `math` module is not imported, which will cause a `NameError` when the function is called.
2. The function does not handle negative or zero values for radius and height, which are not valid in the context of calculating a physical dimension.
3. The function does not provide any validation for input types, which could lead to runtime errors if non-numeric types are passed as arguments.

Since the function does not work correctly in the context of the potential input cases mentioned above, the correctness is deemed false.
