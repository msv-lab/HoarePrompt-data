Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to calculate the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. However, it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. 

The main issue lies in the condition used to check if the sum of the two shovel costs ends with nines. The condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` does not accurately check if the sum has trailing nines. 

For example, consider the input `n = 50`. The maximum number of nines in this case is 2, which occurs with the shovel costs 49 and 50 (totaling 99). However, the program is likely to miss counting this valid pair due to the incorrect condition. 

A better approach would involve explicitly checking if the last digits of the sum equal `99`, `9`, or `0`, depending on how many trailing nines are desired.

Therefore, the program fails for this case and potentially more, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
