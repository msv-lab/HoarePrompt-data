According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the computed value of `n // 2`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that it has a value between 1 and `n // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

If `i` is currently some value `k` (where \( 1 \leq k \leq n // 2 \)), then for the loop to run again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n // 2`. Therefore, after the increment, `i` will be `k + 1`, and we need to ensure that `k + 1` is still less than or equal to `n // 2` for the loop to execute again.

So, if `i` is `k`, then for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must satisfy \( n // 2 \geq k + 1 \), which implies \( n \geq 2(k + 1) \). 

State: **`n` is an input integer such that \( n \geq 2(k + 1) \); `i` is \( k + 1 \)**
