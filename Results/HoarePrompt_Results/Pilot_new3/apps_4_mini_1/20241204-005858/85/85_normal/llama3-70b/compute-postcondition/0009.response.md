According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `i` is \( k + 1 \), we can determine the next value of `i` will be \( k + 2 \).

The state specifies that \( n \) is an integer such that \( n \geq 2(k + 1) \). This means that for the loop to execute one more time, \( n \) must also satisfy the condition \( n \geq 2(k + 2) \).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the next values will be:
- `i` will be \( k + 2 \)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to \( 2(k + 2) \)

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n \geq 2(k + 2) \), `i` is \( k + 2 \)**
