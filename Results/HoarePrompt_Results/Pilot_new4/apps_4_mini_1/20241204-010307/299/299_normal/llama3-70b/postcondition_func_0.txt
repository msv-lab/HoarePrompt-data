The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n. It checks whether the integer division of `n - 1` by `k` is greater than the integer division of `n` by `k`. If the condition holds true, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
