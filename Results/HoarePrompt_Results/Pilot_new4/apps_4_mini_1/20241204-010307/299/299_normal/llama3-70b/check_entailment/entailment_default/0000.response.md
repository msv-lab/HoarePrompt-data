To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze them in detail.

**Problem Description Review:**
- Sasha and Lena play a game where they take turns crossing out exactly `k` sticks from `n` sticks in total.
- Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
- If there are fewer than `k` sticks left before a turn, the game ends.

**Program Logic:**
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
The program checks if the number of moves Sasha can make is greater than the number of moves Lena can make. It calculates:
- `n // k`: The total number of moves possible with `n` sticks.
- `(n - 1) // k`: The total number of moves possible with `n - 1` sticks (this represents the scenario after Sasha's first move).

If the number of moves possible with `n - 1` sticks is greater than with `n` sticks, then Sasha wins by making strictly more moves than Lena.

**Output Hints Review:**
- The output hints clarify that the program checks the integer division of `n - 1` by `k` against `n` by `k`, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on this condition.

**Edge Cases:**
1. **Minimum Values**: When `n = 1` and `k = 1`, Sasha crosses out 1 stick, leaving 0 for Lena, thus Sasha wins ("YES"). The program correctly identifies this.
2. **Equal Moves Scenario**: For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, Sasha crosses out 4 sticks (6 left), then Lena crosses out 4 sticks (2 left), which means moves are equal. The program correctly outputs "NO".
3. **Higher Values**: Consider `n = 5`, `k = 3`. In this case:
   - Sasha crosses out 3 sticks (2 left).
   - Lena cannot make a move because there are fewer than `k` sticks. Here, Sasha wins. The program should output "YES".
   - Calculation:
     - `(5 - 1) // 3 = 1`
     - `5 // 3 = 1`
     - Here `(5 - 1) // 3` is not greater than `5 // 3`, which means it outputs "NO", which is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
The program fails for the edge case of `n = 5` and `k = 3`, where Sasha should win. The logic used to check the number of moves does not account for situations where Sasha can end the game due to Lena having no valid moves left.

Correctness: **False**.
