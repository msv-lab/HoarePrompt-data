The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with constraints that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n. The function does not specify its output in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior based on the parameters given. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n. The specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
