The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. It does not change any variable values or modify the state of the variables `n` and `k`. 

The conditions regarding `n` and `k` remain valid, and the output confirms that the condition of \( n // k \) being an odd integer is met.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \), `k` is an input positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), and the current value of \( n // k \) is an odd integer; output is 'YES'.**
