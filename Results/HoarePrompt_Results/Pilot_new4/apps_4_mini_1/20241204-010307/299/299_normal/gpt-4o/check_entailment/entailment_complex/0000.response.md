The program is designed to determine the winner of a game between Sasha and Lena based on the number of sticks (`n`) and the number of sticks that can be crossed out per turn (`k`). 

Let's analyze the logic of the program step by step:

1. **Understanding the Game**: 
   - Sasha and Lena take turns crossing out `k` sticks from a total of `n` sticks.
   - Sasha moves first.
   - The game continues until there are less than `k` sticks remaining, at which point the player whose turn it is cannot make a move.
   - Sasha wins if he has made strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Turn Calculation**: 
   - The total number of turns that can be made is determined by how many full `k` sticks can be crossed out from `n`, which is `n // k`.
   - If `n // k` is odd, it implies Sasha will have one more turn than Lena (since he starts first). Thus, Sasha wins.
   - If `n // k` is even, both players will have the same number of turns, and Sasha does not win.

3. **Program Logic**: 
   - The program calculates `n // k` and checks if it is odd or even.
   - If it's odd, it prints "YES" (Sasha wins); if it's even, it prints "NO" (Sasha does not win).

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly implements the rules outlined in the problem description. It effectively determines the winner based on the count of moves each player can make.
   - It adheres to the requirements, handling all edge cases defined by the input constraints (with `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18` and `k ≤ n`).

Given this analysis, the program meets the problem description and correctly determines the winner of the game for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
