Let's analyze the given problem description and the provided Python program.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- Two players, Sasha and Lena, take turns crossing out `k` sticks from a total of `n` sticks.
- Sasha moves first. The game ends when there are fewer than `k` sticks left.
- Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
- We need to determine if Sasha wins based on the values of `n` and `k`.

**Python Program:**
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n // k % 2 == 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

**Output Hints Summary:**
- The program computes the integer division of `n` by `k` and checks if the result is odd (which would mean Sasha makes more moves). If odd, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The program uses the formula `n // k` to determine how many full turns both players can take.
2. It checks if that number is odd (Sasha wins) or even (Sasha does not win).

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n = k`, then Sasha will make exactly one move, and Lena will not be able to make any move. Thus, Sasha wins ('YES').
- If `n = 2k`, both players will make exactly one move, leading to a tie ('NO').
- If `n > 2k`, the number of moves can be analyzed based on the remainder of the division, but the critical factor is whether the full turns (obtained by `n // k`) are odd or even.

**Examining Output Hints:**
The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the code:
- The program checks the parity of the number of full turns (`n // k`).
- It prints 'YES' if that number is odd (indicating Sasha has more moves) and 'NO' otherwise.

**Conclusion:**
The code correctly implements the logic of the problem according to the description. All edge cases, including those highlighted above, confirm the correctness of the code. It accurately handles whether Sasha wins based on the number of sticks and the sticks taken per turn.

Correctness: **True**
