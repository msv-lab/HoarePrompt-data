The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its signature, but it is implied that it operates with two positive integer inputs, `n` and `k`, such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n. The functionality of the function is expected to produce results based on these constraints. 

Given the lack of specific output description in the output section, the function could perform various computations or return values that depend on the relationship between `n` and `k`. However, based on the provided constraints and the context, it is reasonable to infer that the function will compute some result that reflects the properties or relationship of the two positive integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n. The function returns a result based on the relationship between n and k.**
