The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`. The value of `n` is between 3 and 10, which means `nx` will be between `x - 1` and `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
