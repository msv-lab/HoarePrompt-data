The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and indicates that `ncur` has been added to the `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur and piece`, `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
