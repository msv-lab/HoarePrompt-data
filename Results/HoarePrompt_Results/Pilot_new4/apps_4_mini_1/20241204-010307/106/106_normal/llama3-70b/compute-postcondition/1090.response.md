Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `dist` is initialized for reachable positions; `parent` reflects previous positions for reachable states; `queue` contains reachable tuples derived from the iterations; `piece` is equal to 1; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the distance from the start position to `ncur` in `dist[1]` is greater than the distance from the start position to `cur` in `dist[1]` plus 1.***
