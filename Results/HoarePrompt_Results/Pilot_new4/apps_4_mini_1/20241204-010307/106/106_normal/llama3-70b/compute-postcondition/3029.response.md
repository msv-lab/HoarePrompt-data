The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined from the initial state, where `nx` is equal to `x + 1` and `ny` is 2. The value of `N` remains unchanged within the specified range. The states of the other variables also remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the unchanged variables and the assignment of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
