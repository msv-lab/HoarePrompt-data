Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it now also contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is set to 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
