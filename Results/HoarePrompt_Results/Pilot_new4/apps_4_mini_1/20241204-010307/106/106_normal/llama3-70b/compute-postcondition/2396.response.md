The code assigns `parent[0][ncur]` the value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly defined in the provided state, but they are used directly as is. Other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes all preconditions and updates only the changed values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][dy]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
