The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the `dist` array at the index `[2][ncur]` with the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The specific values depend on the values of `ncur` and `cur`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, but we do not have the specific values for `cur` or `A[x][y + 1]`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dist[2][ncur]` has been updated based on `dist[2][cur]`, but without specific values for `cur` or `ncur`, we can only state that the array has been modified.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
