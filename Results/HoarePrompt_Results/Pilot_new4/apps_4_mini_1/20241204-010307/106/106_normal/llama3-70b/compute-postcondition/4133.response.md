The code adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous states of the variables have not changed due to this operation, but we note that `ncur` is not specifically defined in this context. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of the other variables along with the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 4, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`.**
