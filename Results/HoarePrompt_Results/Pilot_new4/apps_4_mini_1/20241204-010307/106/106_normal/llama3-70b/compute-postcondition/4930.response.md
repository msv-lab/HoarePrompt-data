The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The precondition states that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged in this situation. Hence, the output state captures the assignment made by the code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and N-2, `dx` and `dy` are processed, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
