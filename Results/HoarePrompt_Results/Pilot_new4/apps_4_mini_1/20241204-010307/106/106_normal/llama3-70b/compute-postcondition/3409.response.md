Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
