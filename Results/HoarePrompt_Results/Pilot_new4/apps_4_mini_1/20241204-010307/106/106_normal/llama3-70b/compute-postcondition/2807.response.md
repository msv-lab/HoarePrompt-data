To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables and their conditions. 

1. The loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent coordinate changes (`dx`, `dy`). This list is static and does not depend on the program state.
2. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, as it does not depend on them directly.
3. The loop will execute a fixed number of times (8 iterations) since the list contains 8 tuples.

However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot ascertain the exact conditions necessary within the loop body itself.

Given that the loop does not have any conditions that prevent it from executing based on the provided states, the only requirement we need to ensure is that `N` is within its specified bounds and that `N` is greater than `y + 1` to respect the condition mentioned.

Thus, the relevant states we need to confirm for the loop to execute are already satisfied since:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- `y` is modified to `y + 1`, which must be valid in the context of `N`.

To clarify, we restate the conditions:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is now `y + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples, and `N` must be greater than `y + 1`.**
