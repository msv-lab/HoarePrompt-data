The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]` with the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of `cur` and `piece` depend on previous calculations but are not altered by this code snippet. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`**.
