Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `piece` is 1; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` includes `ncur` and `(ncur, 1)`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If the condition for `nx` and `ny` is not satisfied, no changes are made to the variables.***
