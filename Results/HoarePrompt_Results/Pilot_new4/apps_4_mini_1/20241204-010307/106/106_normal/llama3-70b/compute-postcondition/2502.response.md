The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are being added to the `queue`, but the previous states of other variables remain unchanged. The specifics of `ncur` depend on the values of `x`, which is involved in its calculation as `nx = x - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
