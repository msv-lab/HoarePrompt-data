Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
