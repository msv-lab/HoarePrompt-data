To determine the output state, we analyze the code snippet and the initial state provided.

Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, and no further pairs exist to iterate over.

The code snippet is:
```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```

1. The variable `nx` is defined as `1 + dx`, and `ny` is defined as `2 + dy`. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so `nx` and `ny` can take on various values depending on `dx` and `dy`.
2. The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The actual value of `ncur` will depend on the specific values of `nx` and `ny` which, in turn, depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`.
3. The code does not modify any of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, or `cur`. 

Since we do not have specific values for `dx` and `dy`, we cannot determine exact values for `nx`, `ny`, or `ncur`. However, we acknowledge that `ncur` will be some value from the array `A` based on the computed indices.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
