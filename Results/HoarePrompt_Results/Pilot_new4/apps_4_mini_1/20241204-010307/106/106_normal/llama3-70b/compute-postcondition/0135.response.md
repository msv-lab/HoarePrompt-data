According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing direction changes (dx, dy). There are four iterations in total, one for each tuple. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed one of these direction tuples.

Since `dx` and `dy` are being taken from the list of direction pairs, we need to determine the current state of these variables. The loop will execute again for the next tuple in the list. If the current iteration processed the first direction `(-1, -1)`, the next will process `(-1, 1)`, and so on, until all tuples have been processed.

Considering that the loop has not completed all iterations (as `dx` and `dy` would not be assigned the last tuple yet), we can determine the next values for `dx` and `dy`. If we are currently on the first tuple, the next will be `(-1, 1)`. If we are on the second, the next will be `(1, -1)`, and if we are on the third, the next will be `(1, 1)`.

Since the current loop iteration state is not provided, we can infer that the loop will iterate through all four tuples consecutively. Therefore, the next state will depend on which direction has been processed last. 

Assuming that the last processed tuple was `(-1, -1)`, in the next iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will change to `-1` and `1`, respectively.

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y + 1`; 0 ≤ `nx`, `ny` < `N`; if `0 ≤ nx < N` and `0 ≤ ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the `queue` has a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
