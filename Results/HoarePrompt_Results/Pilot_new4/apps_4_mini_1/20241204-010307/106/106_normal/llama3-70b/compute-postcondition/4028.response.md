The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the list `queue`. Given that `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions that were added during the iterations, the state of `queue` is updated to include the new tuple. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as the other conditions provided do not affect them directly. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances from the starting point to reachable points, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, and `queue` now contains the previously existing tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`.**
