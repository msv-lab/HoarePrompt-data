Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. If `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on valid positions around `(x, y)`, `parent[2][ncur]` represents the predecessors for those updated positions, and `queue` now includes `(cur, i)`. If no updates were made during this process, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty.***
