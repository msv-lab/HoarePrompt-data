To understand the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the variables involved and how they are affected by the loop.

1. The loop iterates over the list of tuples `[( -1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, which contains four pairs of `(dx, dy)`.
2. The loop variable `(dx, dy)` will take each of these pairs in order, starting from the first pair `(-1, -1)` to the last pair `(1, 1)`.

Given that `y` is 2 and `nx` is defined as `x + dx` and `ny` is `2 + dy`, we need to determine how these variables will change after the last iteration.

- The current value of `piece`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are dependent on the operations within the loop body and the conditions checked.
- The last pair processed by the loop would be `(1, 1)`, which means in that iteration:
  - `nx` would be calculated as `x + 1`
  - `ny` would be calculated as `2 + 1`, which is `3`

Now, to prepare for the next iteration:
- The loop will attempt to move on to the next pair `(1, -1)`, which is not present in the list since it would have already processed the last pair.
- As this particular loop has a fixed number of iterations (4 pairs), we can conclude that there will be no more pairs left for the loop to process after the last one.

Thus, the state for the next iteration should reflect that there are no more `(dx, dy)` pairs left, and we do not need to update the `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` as no further execution is possible.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 3, no more pairs in the loop**
