The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the `dist` array at the position `[1][ncur]`. The value assigned to this position is the value at `dist[1][cur]` incremented by 1. The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, but `cur` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `dist[1][ncur]` is now dependent on the current value of `dist[1][cur]`, which is unknown.

Other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `ncur`) remain unchanged, and we do not know the values of `dist[1][cur]` or `dist[1][ncur]` since `cur` is not defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `piece` is the same; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
