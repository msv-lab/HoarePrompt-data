Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions based on the logic defined in the loop; `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` contains all valid tuples that were appended during the loop execution, including any tuples of the form `(cur, i)` where the conditions were met throughout the iterations. If `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur`, the original state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
