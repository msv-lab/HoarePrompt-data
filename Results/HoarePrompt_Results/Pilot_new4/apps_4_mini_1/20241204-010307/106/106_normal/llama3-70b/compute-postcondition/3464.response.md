Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` has been updated to `x + dx`; `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dist[0]` has been updated for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(1, 0)`; `parent[0]` is set accordingly for those positions; `queue` includes the previously valid tuples along with the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 1)`; distances from `dist[0][cur]` reflect the minimum steps required to reach each position from `(1, 0)`; tuples for (dx, dy) are valid for execution; if `piece` equals `1` and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 1)`; otherwise, those variables remain unchanged.***
