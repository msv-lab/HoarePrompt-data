The line of code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` by setting it to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The variables `dist`, `ncur`, and `cur` are directly affected by this operation. Since `dist[1][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it implies that the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which means it is no longer greater than the previous value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `x` is a valid integer within bounds; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
