Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, and `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`. For every valid `(nx, ny)` derived from the moves defined in the loop, if the conditions are met, `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated to the respective new distances, and `parent[0][ncur]` will be set to the respective values of `cur` and `piece`. If the conditions are not met for a particular move, the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged for that iteration.**
