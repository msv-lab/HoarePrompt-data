Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distances updated based on valid moves; `parent[1]` reflects the parent nodes updated according to valid moves; `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples based on the successful updates of distances. If no valid moves are made, `dist[1]` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `parent[1]` remains unchanged as well, while `queue` may be empty or retain previously added elements based on earlier iterations.**
