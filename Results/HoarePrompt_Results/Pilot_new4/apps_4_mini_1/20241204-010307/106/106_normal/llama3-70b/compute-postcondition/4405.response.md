Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point based on valid moves, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move, and `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)` that have been added during the iterations of the loop. If no valid moves are possible, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
