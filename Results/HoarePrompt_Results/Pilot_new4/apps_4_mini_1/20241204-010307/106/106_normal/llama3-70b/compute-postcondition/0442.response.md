Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[2]` contains updated distance values for all valid positions reachable with piece 2, `parent[2]` stores the last positions and pieces for those valid positions, and `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(cur, i)` if the value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no valid moves were found, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
