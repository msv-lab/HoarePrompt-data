Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions including (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][N + 1]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist[2][ncur]` or `parent[2][ncur]`.***
