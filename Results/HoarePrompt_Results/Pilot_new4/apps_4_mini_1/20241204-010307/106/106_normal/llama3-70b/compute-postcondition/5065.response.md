The line of code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns values to the `parent` array at the specific indices `2` and `ncur`. The variable `cur` holds the current position, and `piece` is equal to `2`. Therefore, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple containing `cur` and `piece`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, meaning `dist`, `cur`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` retain their values from the initial state. 

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `cur` is the current position, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (cur, 2)**.
