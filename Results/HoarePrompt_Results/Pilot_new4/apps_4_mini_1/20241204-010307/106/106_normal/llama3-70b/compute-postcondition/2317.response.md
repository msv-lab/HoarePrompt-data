The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x - 1` and `y + 1`, respectively. However, `x` and `y` are unspecified in the initial state, so `nx` and `ny` will depend on the current values of `x` and `y`. Since other variables (`dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged, the output state reflects the assignment made to `ncur` based on `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, and the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
