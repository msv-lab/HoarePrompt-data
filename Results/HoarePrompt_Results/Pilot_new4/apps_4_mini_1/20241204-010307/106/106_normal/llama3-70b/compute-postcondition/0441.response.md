The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The current state of the program is not directly affecting the initial conditions of `N`, `y`, `x`, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, or the context of valid moves. Therefore, the changes are limited to the `queue`, which is updated to include the new tuple. 

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[2]` contains updated distance values for all valid positions reachable with piece 2, `parent[2]` stores the last positions and pieces for those valid positions, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(cur, i)`, and the value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
