The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The initial state does not affect the other variables, and since `queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can conclude that the output state will include all the initial conditions along with the modified `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
