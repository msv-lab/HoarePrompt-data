To determine the adjusted states for the `for` loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop and the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`. The key considerations for the loop to iterate again are based on whether there are any more tuples left in the list.

Given the current state:
- The loop will iterate through each tuple in the list of direction tuples.
- The current iteration has already processed the first tuple `(-1, -1)`.

Since this is a `for` loop over a fixed list of tuples, there are 4 iterations total (for 4 tuples). Since we are currently processing the first tuple, we can conclude that the next iteration will handle the second tuple.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration:
- We need to note that the loop has processed the tuple `(-1, -1)` and will now process the next tuple.
- The next tuple will be `(-1, 1)`.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that we are now processing the second tuple from the list of direction tuples.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
