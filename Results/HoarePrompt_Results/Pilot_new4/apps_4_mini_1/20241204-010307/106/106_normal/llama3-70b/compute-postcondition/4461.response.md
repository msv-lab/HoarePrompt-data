Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `dist[2]` contains the updated distances from `cur` for all reachable positions where valid moves occurred, and `parent[2]` contains the corresponding parent states for those positions; `queue` now contains the valid position `cur` paired with `i`, and `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
