The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous values of the variables `cur`, `piece`, and `parent` are not specified, but the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to a tuple `(cur, piece)`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
