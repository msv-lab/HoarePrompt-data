The code assigns `dist[0][ncur]` the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur]`, after the assignment it will no longer be greater, as it will now equal `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist` reflects updated shortest path distances, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, `queue` includes all reachable tuples derived from the iterations, the current value of `piece` is 0.`**
