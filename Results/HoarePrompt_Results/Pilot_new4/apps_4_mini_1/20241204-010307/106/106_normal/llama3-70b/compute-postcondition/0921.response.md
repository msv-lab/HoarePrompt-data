To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, we analyze the components involved in the loop based on the provided information.

1. The loop iterates over the pairs `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`, which means there are 4 iterations in total.
2. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take the values from each of these pairs in subsequent iterations.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider which pair was last used and what the next pair will be.

Assuming that the loop has already iterated through some pairs, we need to find out how to increment the state based on the current iteration of the pairs:

- If we are at the first iteration with `(-1, -1)`, the next will be `(-1, 1)`.
- If we are at the second iteration with `(-1, 1)`, the next will be `(1, -1)`.
- If we are at the third iteration with `(1, -1)`, the next will be `(1, 1)`.
- Finally, if we are at the fourth iteration with `(1, 1)`, the loop will complete, and no further iterations will happen unless we reset.

Given that the current state indicates `piece` is equal to 1 and possibly `dist` is updated or not, we know we are invoking the next iteration of the loop for the next pair of values for `dx` and `dy`.

### Conclusion:
Assuming the last values used were for the pair `(1, 1)`, the next pair would be `None`, leading to no further iterations. But if we were at, say, the third pair `(1, -1)`, we would be preparing for `(1, 1)`.

Therefore, to adjust the state:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + 1`, `ny` is equal to `1 + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`, if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`.**
