Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur` based on valid knight moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` includes the tuple `(cur, i)` added to it, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the loop did not execute, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
