Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors of each reachable position with their corresponding piece values, and `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions with piece value 2. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no positions are reachable, `dist` and `parent` remain unmodified for those positions, and `queue` is empty.***
