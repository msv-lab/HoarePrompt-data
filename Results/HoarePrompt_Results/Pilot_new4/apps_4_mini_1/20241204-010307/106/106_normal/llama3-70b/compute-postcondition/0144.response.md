The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -1, we can express this as:

- `nx = x - 1`
- `ny = y - 1`

Since `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, both `nx` and `ny` will remain within valid bounds, and `ny` will also be a valid variable since `0 ≤ ny < N`.

The states of other variables, including `N`, `piece`, and `dist`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y - 1`; 0 ≤ `nx`, `ny` < `N; (dx, dy)` is (-1, -1)**
