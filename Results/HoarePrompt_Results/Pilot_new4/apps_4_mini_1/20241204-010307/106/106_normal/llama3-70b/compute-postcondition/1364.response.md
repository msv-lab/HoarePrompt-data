Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 to N, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
