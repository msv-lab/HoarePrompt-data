The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`. Before the code executes, it is given that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Therefore, after executing the code, the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` will be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which indicates that the value has changed.

Since `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it will no longer be greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` after execution, implying that the condition about its original value is no longer valid.

Other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `cur`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the execution of this line of code. 

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 1 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
