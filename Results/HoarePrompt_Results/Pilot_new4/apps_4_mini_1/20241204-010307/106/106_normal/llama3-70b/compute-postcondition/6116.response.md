To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the structure of the loop and how `dx` and `dy` are modified through the iterations.

The loop iterates over the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which means it will go through the following iterations:

1. **First iteration**: `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0.
2. **Second iteration**: `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0.
3. **Third iteration**: `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1.
4. **Fourth iteration**: `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, since `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, we have already executed the first iteration. The next iteration will use the second pair of values: `dx` will be 1 and `dy` will be 0.

For the loop to execute one more time (in the second iteration), we will need to adjust the state as follows:

- `dx` is updated to 1.
- `dy` remains 0.

The rest of the states do not change as they are only dependent on the conditions within the loop body and not affected by the loop iteration changes. The bounds on `N`, `x`, `y`, `cur`, `dist`, `piece`, and `queue` remain the same, as they are not being modified by this loop iteration.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, and `ny` is `y`**
