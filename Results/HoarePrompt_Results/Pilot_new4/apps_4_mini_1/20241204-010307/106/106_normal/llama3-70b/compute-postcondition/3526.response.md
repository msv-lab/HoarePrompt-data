The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. Given that `x` is within `0` and `N-1` and `y` is also within `0` and `N-1`, the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next tuple for `k + 1` where `k < 8`, thus their specific values are not provided but are constrained by the rules of the program.

Therefore, the output state reflects these assignments:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
