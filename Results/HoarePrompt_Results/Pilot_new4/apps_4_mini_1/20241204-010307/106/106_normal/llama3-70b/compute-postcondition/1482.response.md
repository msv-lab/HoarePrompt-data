The code assigns values to `parent[2][ncur]`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[1][1]`, and it is assumed that `cur` is defined elsewhere in the code context. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` remain unchanged. 

The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided, so we cannot determine their exact values in the output state. However, we acknowledge that `parent[2][ncur]` is being updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[1][1]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
