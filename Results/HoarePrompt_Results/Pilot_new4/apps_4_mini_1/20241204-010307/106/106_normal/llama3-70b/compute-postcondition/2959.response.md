Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. If these conditions are not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
