The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The previous values relevant to the operation are `nx`, which is calculated as `x + dx`, and `ny`, which is calculated as `y + dy`. Therefore, `ncur` will be assigned the value from the array `A` at the position determined by those coordinates.

The precondition states that `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, and `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`. The values for `dist`, `parent`, `dx`, and `dy` remain valid and unchanged. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` will be updated to reflect the calculated positions, but we do not have explicit values for `x`, `dx`, or `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `dx` and `dy` are the second tuple in the list of possible moves, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
