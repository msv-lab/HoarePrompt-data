The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but they are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. The initial state indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` can be modified, and `queue` contains reachable cells, but these variables are not directly affected by this code. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` will determine the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, and the other variables remain unchanged:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
