The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are used directly, but since we don't know their specific values from the initial state, we can only state that they are assigned.

The values of other variables remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
