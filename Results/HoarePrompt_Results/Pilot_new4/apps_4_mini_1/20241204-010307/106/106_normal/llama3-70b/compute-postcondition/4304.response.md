The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `y` is equal to `N`, we can substitute `y` with `N`. The previous states of `nx` and `ny` can be expressed as `nx = x - 2` and `ny = N - 1`. Thus, after executing the code, the new values of `nx` and `ny` will be determined by the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`.

The output state reflecting the changes and previous constraints of the variables is as follows: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, and `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, and `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
