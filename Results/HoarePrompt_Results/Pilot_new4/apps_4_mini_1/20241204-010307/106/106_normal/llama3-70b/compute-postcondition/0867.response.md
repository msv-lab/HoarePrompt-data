The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The previous state of `ncur` is defined by the initial state, which is `A[-1][0]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `parent` are unaffected by this operation. 

The output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the addition of the tuple to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-1][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`, and `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`.**
