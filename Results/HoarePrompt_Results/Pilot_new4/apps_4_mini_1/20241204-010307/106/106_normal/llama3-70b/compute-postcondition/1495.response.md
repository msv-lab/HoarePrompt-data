The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `2 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively, and are within the valid range (0 to N, where N is between 3 and 10). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, `queue` are in a valid state, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
