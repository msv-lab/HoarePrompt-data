The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The previous state indicates that the `queue` already contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for valid positions, meaning `ncur` is being processed for the current state. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 1)`; `queue` now contains additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is equal to 1; current direction being processed is `(-1, 1)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
