Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; if both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), and if `piece` is equal to 1 and the distance condition `dist[1][ncur]` > `dist[1][cur] + 1` is satisfied, then `dist` is updated to reflect the new distances, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` remains 1, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If either condition is not met, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
