The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the equations `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. The previous values are `y` which is 1, and `dx` and `dy`, both of which are also 1. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot derive a specific value for `nx`, but we can express it as `nx = x + 1`. The value of `ny` will be `1 + 1`, which equals `2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 2**.
