To analyze the state for the next iteration of the for loop, we need to consider the following points:

1. The loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples representing the possible changes in coordinates (dx, dy).
2. The list contains 8 tuples: `(-2, -1)`, `(-2, 1)`, `(-1, -2)`, `(-1, 2)`, `(1, -2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, -1)`, and `(2, 1)`.
3. The variable `dx` and `dy` will take on each of these values in each iteration of the loop.

Since the loop will execute once for each tuple in the list, and assuming that the current iteration is the first one where `dx` and `dy` are `(-2, -1)`, we can conclude the following for the next iteration:

- The next values for `(dx, dy)` will be `(-2, 1)` in the second iteration. 
- The loop will continue until it has iterated through all 8 tuples.

Therefore, at the end of the last iteration with the current values of `dx` and `dy`, we will need to reflect what the next values will be for the subsequent iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is `1 + (-2)`, `ny` is `N - 1 + (-1)`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1**
