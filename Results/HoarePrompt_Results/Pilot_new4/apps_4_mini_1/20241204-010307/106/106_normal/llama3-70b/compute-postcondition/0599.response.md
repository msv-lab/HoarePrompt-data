The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are affected by this assignment, while `N`, `piece`, `dx`, and `dy` retain their values. Given that `y` is currently 0, `ny` becomes `dy` after this operation, and `nx` becomes `x + dx`. The code does not provide specific values for `x`, `dx`, or `dy`, so we will express the output in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `dy`.**
