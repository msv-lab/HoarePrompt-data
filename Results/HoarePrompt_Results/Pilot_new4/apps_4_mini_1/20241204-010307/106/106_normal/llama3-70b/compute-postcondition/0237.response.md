Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distances from the starting position based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains parent pointers corresponding to the updated distances, and `queue` contains all reachable states appended during the iterations based on valid positions. If no valid positions were found, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
