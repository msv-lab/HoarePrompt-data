According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. The loop will continue executing as long as `queue` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must contain at least one tuple. Since the state provided does not indicate that `queue` is empty, it can still have elements left. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from `cur` to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position and their corresponding piece values, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, and `cur` is the value of the last processed piece.**
