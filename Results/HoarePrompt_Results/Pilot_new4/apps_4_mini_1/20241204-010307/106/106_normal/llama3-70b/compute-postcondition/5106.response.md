The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the `queue`, but no other variables are affected. The existing values and conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `3 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
