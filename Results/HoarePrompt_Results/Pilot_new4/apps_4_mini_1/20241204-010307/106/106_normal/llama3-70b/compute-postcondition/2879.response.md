According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of direction changes represented by `(dx, dy)`, which contains 4 pairs: `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variables `N`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, `cur`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged as the conditions within the loop body dictate whether any updates occur. 

Since the loop is based on the number of elements in the list of direction changes, which is 4, and the last iteration would have processed the last element in the list, the next iteration would need to move to the next direction pair. However, since the loop is finite (iterating through a predefined list), there will be no next iteration.

To reflect that the loop has completed its execution over all possible direction changes, we need to note that the next state would not involve further changes to the states involved in this loop since the loop will not execute again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop (which actually will not occur) remains unchanged, with an increment in the index variable that would have been used to iterate through the list if it were continuing.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist` remains as it is, `parent` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged**.
