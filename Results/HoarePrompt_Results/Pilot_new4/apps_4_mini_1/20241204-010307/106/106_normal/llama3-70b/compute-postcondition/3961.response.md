The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added as a new element in the `queue`. The states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, `dy`, and `parent` are unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
