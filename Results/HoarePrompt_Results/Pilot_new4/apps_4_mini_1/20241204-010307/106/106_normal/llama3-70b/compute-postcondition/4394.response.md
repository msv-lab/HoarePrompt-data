Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `N - 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
