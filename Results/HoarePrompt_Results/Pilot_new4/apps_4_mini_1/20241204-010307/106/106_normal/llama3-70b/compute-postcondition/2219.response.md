To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

The loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the directional moves. Therefore, the loop will execute regardless of the values in `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`, since the loop's execution is based solely on the provided list of tuples. 

However, the behavior of the loop and its effect on the state during execution will depend on the conditions and logic within the omitted loop body. Specifically, it is important to consider the meaning of the `piece` variable and how it relates to the loop's execution.

1. The loop will execute for each of the directional tuples: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. This means that the loop will run exactly 4 times, regardless of the state of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.

2. The conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` are mentioned to be satisfied for any `ncur`, which implies that the loop body should contain logic that utilizes the directions provided by `(dx, dy)` to potentially update `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.

3. The initial state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` does not affect whether the loop itself will run. Instead, it is crucial that the conditions to update these variables are checked within the loop body.

Thus, since the loop will execute, the only necessary state adjustments are related to the values of `piece`, `ncur`, and any other variables required to satisfy the loop's conditions, which are not explicitly provided.

State: **`piece` is 0, `ncur` satisfies the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state before execution.**
