The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` modifies the value at position `(0, ncur)` in the `dist` list. The new value at `dist[0][ncur]` is determined by adding 1 to the existing value at `dist[0][cur]`. The variable `ncur` is derived from `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, which means `ncur` will hold a specific value based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `N`, and `dy`.

Since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, and `y` is equal to `N`, we have that `y` also falls within the same range. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state reflects the update to `dist[0][ncur]` based on `dist[0][cur]`, while noting that `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` retain their relationships as previously defined.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
