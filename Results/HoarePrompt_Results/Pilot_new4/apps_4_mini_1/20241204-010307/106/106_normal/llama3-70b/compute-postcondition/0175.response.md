In the code provided, `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the constant `2` are used to form this tuple. This operation does not affect any other variables and simply modifies the `queue` data structure by adding a new element.

Given that:
- `N` is an integer between 3 and 10,
- `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`,
- `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, 
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, 
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`,
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, 
- `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, 
- `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

The `queue` now contains a new element `(ncur, 2)`, while the other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` contains a tuple `(ncur, 2)` added to it.**
