Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to (cur, 0), and `queue` contains applicable tuples including `(cur, i)`, `(ncur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged. The values of `nx` and `ny` remain between 0 and N, and `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` continue to be valid.***
