The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and pairs it with `piece`. The previous states of the variables `parent`, `cur`, and `piece` are updated, while the states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`**.
