According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the iterable defined by the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]` which consists of the directional changes. This list contains four pairs of coordinates, so the loop will always execute four times regardless of other states. The relevant states that need to be considered are `dx` and `dy`, which will be assigned the values from the tuples in each iteration.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10 and `y` is initialized to 1, these values do not directly influence the execution of the loop itself since they are not explicitly modified within the loop's context. However, we need to set `dx` and `dy` for the first iteration at the start of the loop.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0** (for the first iteration of the loop).
