The code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. Given that `nx` has been updated to `1` and `ny` has been updated to `-1`, the value of `ncur` will now be the element in the array `A` at that position. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, meaning its value is now determined by that specific array index.

The previous variable values remain valid, but `ncur` is updated to the value at the new indices. Therefore, we also need to note that the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]` (the value of the array at that position)**.
