The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. Since `ncur` is defined as `A[1][2]`, we assume it holds some value based on the state of the variable `A`. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, but we need to specify that `queue` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
