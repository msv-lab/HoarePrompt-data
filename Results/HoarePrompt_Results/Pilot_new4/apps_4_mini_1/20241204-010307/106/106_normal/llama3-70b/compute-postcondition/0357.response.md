Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, if `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, the `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
