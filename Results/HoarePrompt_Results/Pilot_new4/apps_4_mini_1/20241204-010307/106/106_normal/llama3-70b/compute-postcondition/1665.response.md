Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur` based on valid knight moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, and `queue` contains all reachable cells and their corresponding pieces that were added during the loop iterations. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
