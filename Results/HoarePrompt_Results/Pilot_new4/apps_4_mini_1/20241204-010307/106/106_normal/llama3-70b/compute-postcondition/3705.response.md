The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the constant `0` are specific inputs to the `append` method, which modifies `queue` but does not affect the other variables directly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `queue` previously included the next pair of `(dx, dy)`, the new state of `queue` will include the former values along with the new tuple. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain valid and unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the previous pairs and now also includes `(ncur, 0)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
