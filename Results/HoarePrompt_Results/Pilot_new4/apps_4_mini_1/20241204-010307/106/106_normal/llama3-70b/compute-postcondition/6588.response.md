The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so they remain unknown. Consequently, the output will reflect that `nx` and `ny` are based on calculations involving `x` and `y`, but the exact values cannot be determined without knowing `dx` and `dy`.

The initial state remains valid for the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `index` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `index` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`.**
