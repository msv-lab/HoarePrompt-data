The code snippet assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `3 + (-1)`, which results in `nx` being `2`. Similarly, `ny` becomes `1 + (-1)`, resulting in `ny` being `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the updated parent tuples with `parent[1][ncur]` now being `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains valid tuples and includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` equals `dist[1][cur] + 1` if the condition `piece == 1 and dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` is satisfied.**
