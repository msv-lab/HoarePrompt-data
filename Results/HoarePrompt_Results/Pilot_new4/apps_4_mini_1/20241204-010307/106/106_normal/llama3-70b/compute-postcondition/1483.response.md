The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[1][1]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
