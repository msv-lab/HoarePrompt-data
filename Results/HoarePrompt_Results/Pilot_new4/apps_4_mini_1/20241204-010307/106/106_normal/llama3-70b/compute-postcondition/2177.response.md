Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, and `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`. If the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` holds true and `piece` is 2, then if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, 2), and `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. If the condition does not hold true, no changes are made.***
