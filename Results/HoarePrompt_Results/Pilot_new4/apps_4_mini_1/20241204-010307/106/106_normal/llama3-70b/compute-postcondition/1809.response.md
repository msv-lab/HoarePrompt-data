Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid neighboring positions `(nx, ny)` within bounds, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned corresponding values for all valid updates, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples from the iterations that executed. If no updates were made, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
