The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0. Therefore, `ny` will be updated to 9 + 0 = 9, and `nx` will be updated to `x + 1`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0.**
