The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `queue` already contains tuples before this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for reachable positions, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
