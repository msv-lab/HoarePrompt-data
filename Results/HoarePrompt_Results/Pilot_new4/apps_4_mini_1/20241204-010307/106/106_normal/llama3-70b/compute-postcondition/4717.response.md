The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This operation affects the `queue` variable by adding a new element, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

The initial state indicates that `queue` already contains tuples, and now it will contain an additional tuple consisting of the current value of `ncur` and the integer `2`. Other variables such as `N`, `y`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x][1]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated; `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur] = (cur, piece)`**.
