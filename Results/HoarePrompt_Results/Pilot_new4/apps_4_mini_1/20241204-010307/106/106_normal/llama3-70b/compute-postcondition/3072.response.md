Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, the current value of `nx` is between 0 and `N`, the current value of `ny` is between 0 and `N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, and the distance from the starting point `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
