The value of `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The new values for `nx` and `ny` are already provided as `nx = x - 1` and `ny = y + 1`. Since `y` is 0, `ny` becomes 1, and `nx` depends on the value of `x`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `nx` could be `x - 1` where `x` is an integer value. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 1, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 1][1]`.**
