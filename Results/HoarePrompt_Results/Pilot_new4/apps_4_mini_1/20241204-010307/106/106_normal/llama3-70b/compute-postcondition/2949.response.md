Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions processed during the iterations. If no positions were reachable based on the conditions set in the loop, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
