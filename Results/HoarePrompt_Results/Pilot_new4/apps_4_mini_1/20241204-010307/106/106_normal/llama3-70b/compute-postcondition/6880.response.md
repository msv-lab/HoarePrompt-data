The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged as they are being used to create the tuple. The `queue` variable is modified to include the new tuple. Other variables (`N`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `piece` is equal to 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
