According to the code, the for loop iterates over the pairs `(dx, dy)` which represent the possible movements in a grid (up, down, left, right). The loop will execute once for each of these pairs. At the end of the last iteration, we have already processed one pair of movements.

Given that there are 4 pairs in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, if we assume that the loop is currently on the last pair `(0, 1)`, it indicates that we need to adjust the state for the next iteration.

Since the loop has executed through all pairs, there will not be a next iteration under the current conditions. The loop state should reflect that we have exhausted the available pairs.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, the loop has completed all pairs, so no further pairs are available for execution.**
