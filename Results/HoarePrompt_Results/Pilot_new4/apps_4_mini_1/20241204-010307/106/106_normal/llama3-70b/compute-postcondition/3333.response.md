The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current position `(x, y)` and the knight's move offsets `dx` and `dy`. Since `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, after the assignment, `nx` will be `0 + dx` and `ny` will be `2 + dy`. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` can vary based on the knight's moves, so `nx` and `ny` can take on values depending on those moves.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering all valid knight's moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`.
