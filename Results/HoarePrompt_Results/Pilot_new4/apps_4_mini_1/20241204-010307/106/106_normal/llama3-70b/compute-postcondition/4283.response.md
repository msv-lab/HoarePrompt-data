The statement assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The values of `parent`, `cur`, and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but we know that `ncur` is a function of `nx` and `ny` which depends on `N`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[2][ncur]` are still valid after the code execution. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `parent` array along with the unchanged conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
