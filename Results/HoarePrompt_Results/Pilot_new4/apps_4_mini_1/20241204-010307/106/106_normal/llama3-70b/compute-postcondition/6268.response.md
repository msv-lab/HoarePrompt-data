Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made. No actions are taken if the condition is not met.***
