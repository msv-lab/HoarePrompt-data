Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 2, and the condition `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` holds true.***
