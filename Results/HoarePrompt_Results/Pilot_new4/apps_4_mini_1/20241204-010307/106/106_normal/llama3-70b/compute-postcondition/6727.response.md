According to the code, the for loop iterates over the tuples in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which contains 4 tuples. The loop will execute once for each tuple in this list, and the loop variable `(dx, dy)` will take on the values of each tuple in order.

Since no changes were made to the loop variables in the previous iteration, we need to determine the current iteration index. The last tuple used in the first iteration would be the first tuple `(-1, 0)` in the first pass, then `(1, 0)`, then `(0, -1)`, and finally `(0, 1)` in the fourth and final pass.

After the fourth iteration, there are no more tuples left to iterate through. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, it would need to start from the beginning of the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, and if `dx` and `dy` are in the range of the first tuple, then for the loop to execute again it must start over, so `(dx, dy)` is `(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)` with the next iteration being a reset.**
