According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which contains four tuples. The loop will execute regardless of the states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, as the iterable is defined statically and does not depend on any conditions. However, for the loop to perform meaningful operations, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` should be in a valid state.

To ensure the loop executes and the program behaves as intended, we must note that:

- `dist` must be initialized correctly, containing valid distances for reachable indices.
- `parent[1][ncur]` should reflect the correct parent tracking relevant to the indices updated during the loop.
- `queue` should contain tuples `(ncur, 1)` representing valid indices that have been updated.

Given that `piece` is 1, we can assume that the distances in `dist[1][...]` represent the shortest paths calculated. The states can be summarized as follows:

State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each updated index during the loop**
