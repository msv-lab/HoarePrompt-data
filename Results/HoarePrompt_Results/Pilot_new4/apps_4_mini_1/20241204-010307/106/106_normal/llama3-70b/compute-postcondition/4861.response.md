The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, and based on the initial conditions that `N` is between 3 and 10, and the constraints `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, it implies that the indices `nx` and `ny` are valid for accessing the 2D list `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`.**
