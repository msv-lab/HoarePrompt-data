Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0, and if the loop did not execute, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
