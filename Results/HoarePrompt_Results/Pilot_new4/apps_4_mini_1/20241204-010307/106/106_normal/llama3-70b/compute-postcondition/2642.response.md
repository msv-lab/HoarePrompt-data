Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is now -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to (cur, piece), and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
