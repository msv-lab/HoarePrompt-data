The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the existing list `queue`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus `(ncur, 1)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
