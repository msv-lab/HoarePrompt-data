The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` is 0, `dx` is -2, `y` is 0, and `dy` is -1, we can calculate:

- `nx` = 0 + (-2) = -2
- `ny` = 0 + (-1) = -1

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1**
