The code attempts to assign the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. Since the last assignment overwrites the previous one, only the last value assigned will be valid. 

The initial states of the affected variables are:
- `parent[2][ncur]` was previously assigned the value `cur`.
- `piece` is equal to 2.

After executing the code, `parent[2][ncur]` will be updated to the value of `piece`, which is 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `-1 + dy`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to 2; `queue` has appended the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
