The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` based on the current value of `dist[1][cur]`. The specific values of `ncur` and `cur` are not given, so we cannot specify their values directly. However, we know that `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]` and that `cur` is an existing index.

The previous state information about `N`, `y`, `x`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remains unchanged since they are not directly affected by this line. The only change is in the `dist` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
