In the given code, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The value of `cur` is the current position, and `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[x][y + 1]`. Thus, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the distance from the current position.

The states of other variables remain unchanged, so we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is the current position, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x][y + 1]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
