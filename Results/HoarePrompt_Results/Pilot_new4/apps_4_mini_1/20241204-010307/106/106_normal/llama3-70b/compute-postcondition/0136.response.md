The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The preconditions remain valid except for the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; 0 â‰¤ `nx`, `ny` < `N`.**
