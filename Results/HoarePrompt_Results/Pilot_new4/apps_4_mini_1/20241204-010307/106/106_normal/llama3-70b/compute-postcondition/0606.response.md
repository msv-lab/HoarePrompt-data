According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing possible movements (dx, dy). The loop will execute for each tuple in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will be set to the last tuple in the provided list, which is (0, 1). Thus, after the last iteration, the loop will have already processed all four directional movements: left (-1, 0), right (1, 0), up (0, -1), and down (0, 1).

Since there are no more tuples left in the list to iterate over, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we would need to consider the loop's list of tuples again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `dy`, with `dx` and `dy` needing to reset to the first tuple in the list, which is (-1, 0)**.
