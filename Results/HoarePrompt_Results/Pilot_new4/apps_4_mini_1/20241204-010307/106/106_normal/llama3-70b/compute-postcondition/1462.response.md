Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` contains tuples of cells added for processing based on valid moves. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N - 1`.***
