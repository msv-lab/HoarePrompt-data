Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; the new value `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`, which may contain multiple elements. If the condition is not met, then the state remains unchanged.***
