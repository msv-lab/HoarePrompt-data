The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are defined as `0 + dx` and `1 + dy`, respectively. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined to be within the bounds of the grid, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The values of `A`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`, but we know that it will be the value located in the 2D array `A` at the coordinates `(nx, ny)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
