Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][1]`. If `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
