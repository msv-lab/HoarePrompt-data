The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to the `parent` array at the specified index `[1][ncur]`. The previous value of `parent[1][ncur]` is overwritten with `cur`. 

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
