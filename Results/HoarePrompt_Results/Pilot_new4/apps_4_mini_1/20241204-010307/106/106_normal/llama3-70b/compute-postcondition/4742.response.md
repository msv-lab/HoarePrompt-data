`parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of `cur`, `piece`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, while `parent` is updated with the new assignment. The other variables and conditions stated in the initial state are still valid. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is defined, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny`, both `nx` and `ny` are less than `N`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
