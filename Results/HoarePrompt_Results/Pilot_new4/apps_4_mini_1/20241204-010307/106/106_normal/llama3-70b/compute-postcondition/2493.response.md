The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. Since `piece` is currently 1, `parent[1][ncur]` will now be assigned the tuple `(cur, 1)`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Additionally, `ncur`, which is `A[nx][ny]`, is still a valid reference for later operations. 

Therefore, the output state becomes:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned the value `(cur, 1)`**.
