The `queue` is updated by appending a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
