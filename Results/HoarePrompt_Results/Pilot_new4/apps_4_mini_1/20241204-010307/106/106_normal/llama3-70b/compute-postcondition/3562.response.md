The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` will be the result of adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `dist[1][ncur]` contains distances and `parent[1][ncur]` indicates previous positions, but these values remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Thus, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while other variables maintain their previous values.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**
