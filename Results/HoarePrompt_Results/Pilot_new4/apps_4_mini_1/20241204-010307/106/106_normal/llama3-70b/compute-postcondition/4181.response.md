Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
