According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of directional changes defined by the pairs `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. Each iteration corresponds to a different direction that can be used to update the positions `nx` and `ny`.

At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine which direction has been processed and how many directions remain to be processed. Since the loop will execute for each of the four directional changes, if `dx` and `dy` are the changes applied in the last iteration, we can assume that they have already been processed.

To adjust for the next iteration:
1. We need to increment through the list of directional changes.
2. If there are still directional changes left to process (up to 4), the loop can execute again.

If `dx` and `dy` corresponded to the last processed direction, then the next direction would be the subsequent one in the defined set. Given that there are 4 possible directions, if the last executed direction was the last one in the list, then the loop will terminate next.

Since we donâ€™t know the exact values of `dx` and `dy` that were processed, we can safely say that for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust for the next direction in the list of movements.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ny` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`.**
