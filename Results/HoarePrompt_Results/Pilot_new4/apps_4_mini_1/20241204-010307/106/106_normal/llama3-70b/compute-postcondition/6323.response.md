The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are now added to `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of this tuple to the `queue`, while retaining all other variables' values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `piece` is equal to 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
