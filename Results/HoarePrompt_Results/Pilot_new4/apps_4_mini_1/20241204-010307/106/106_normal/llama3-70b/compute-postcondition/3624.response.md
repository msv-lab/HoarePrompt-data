Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and the distance from the first piece at `ncur` is greater than the distance from the first piece at `cur` plus 1, i.e., `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
