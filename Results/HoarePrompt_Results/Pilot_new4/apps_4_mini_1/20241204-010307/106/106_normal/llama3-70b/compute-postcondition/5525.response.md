The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are given to be equal to `dx` and `dy` respectively, and both are within the range from 0 to N-1. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, the values of `nx` and `ny` will access valid indices of the 2D array `A`. 

The initial state specifies that `cur` is equal to the value at `A[0][0]`, but no specific information about `A[nx][ny]` is provided. Therefore, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]` which is some value in the matrix `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range from 0 to N-1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
