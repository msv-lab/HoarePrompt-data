Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0 (for the first iteration), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The piece is equal to 2, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
