The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The values of `A`, `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not provided, but `ncur` will depend on the specific values of `A`, `nx`, and `ny`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` remains equal to 2; `dist` and `parent` are unchanged; `queue` retains its current entries; `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
