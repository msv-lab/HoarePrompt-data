The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined such that `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, with both `nx` and `ny` constrained between 0 and N-1 inclusive. Therefore, the value of `ncur` is determined by the indices `nx` and `ny` in the array `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and both `nx` is between 0 and N-1 (inclusive) and `ny` is between 0 and N-1 (inclusive).**
