The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The previous values of `ncur` and `queue` are necessary for determining the output state; however, they are not specified in the initial state. Since `ncur` is derived from the matrix `A[nx][ny]`, its exact value is unknown but depends on `nx` and `ny`, which in turn depend on `dx` and `dy`. 

The state of a tuple is appended to the `queue`, but no other variables are affected or updated in this operation. Therefore, the previous information about `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `dist` is updated such that `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent` is updated such that `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`; `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; and the distance condition holds as previously stated.**
