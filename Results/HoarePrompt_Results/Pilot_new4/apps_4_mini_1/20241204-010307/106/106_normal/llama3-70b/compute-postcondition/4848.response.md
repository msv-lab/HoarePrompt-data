Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `dist[0]` is updated for every valid `(nx, ny)` position based on the conditions met during the iterations, reflecting the shortest path distances; `parent[0]` contains the corresponding parent positions for each updated `ncur`; `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` positions that have been added during the iterations.**
