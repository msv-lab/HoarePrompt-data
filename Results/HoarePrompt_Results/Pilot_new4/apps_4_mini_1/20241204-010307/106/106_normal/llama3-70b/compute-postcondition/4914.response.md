The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are updated in the `parent` array at the index specified by `ncur`. The previous states of the variables remain unchanged except for `parent[0][ncur]`, which now contains two values: `cur` and `piece`.

Since `piece` is currently 0, `parent[0][ncur]` will be set to the value of `cur`, and the current value of `piece` will remain unchanged at 0.

The other variables retain their states, and we note the assignment to the array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; and `dist[0][cur]` is less than `dist[0][ncur] - 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`.**
