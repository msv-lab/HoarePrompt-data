Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is an integer between `0` and `N-1`; `y` is an integer between `0` and `N-1`; `nx` and `ny` represent all possible coordinates resulting from the eight possible moves defined by `dx` and `dy`. If any of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` are valid (i.e., `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`), then `ncur` will have the value of `A[nx][ny]` for those valid moves. The `dist` array will be updated for each valid `ncur` if `piece` is 0 and the condition `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` holds true, leading to potentially multiple updates across `dist` and `parent` arrays. The `queue` will contain tuples of all valid `ncur` values processed during the loop. If the loop does not execute, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
