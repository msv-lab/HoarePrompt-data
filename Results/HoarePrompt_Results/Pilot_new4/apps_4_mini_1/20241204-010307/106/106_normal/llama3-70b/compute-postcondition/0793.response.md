According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. The loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the program state indicates that `queue` is empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must contain at least one tuple of reachable states. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `queue` currently contains at least one tuple.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point for each piece type, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for each `piece`, and `queue` must contain at least one tuple of reachable states**.
