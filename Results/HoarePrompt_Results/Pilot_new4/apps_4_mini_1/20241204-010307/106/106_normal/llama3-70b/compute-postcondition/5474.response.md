Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur = A[4 + dx][2 + dy]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
