The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`. The state of `A` is not provided, but the values of `nx` and `ny` can be determined from the initial state. The value of `ny` will be `1 + dy`, while `nx` remains equal to `dx` as per the initial state. 

The preconditions state that `N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `piece` is equal to 2, and `ncur` is previously assigned the value of `A[0][0]`.

Since `ncur` is being updated to `A[nx][ny]`, the output will now include the new value of `ncur`. However, we do not have the exact values for `A`, `dx`, or `dy`. Thus, we cannot determine the exact value assigned to `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2.**
