The code assigns values to `parent[0][ncur]`, indicating a specific relationship between `cur` and `ncur`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, but they are assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The output state reflects that `parent[0][ncur]` has been updated to the value of `cur` and `piece`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
