The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The previous values for `nx` and `ny` were `x` and `y - 1`, respectively. Therefore, after executing the code:

- `nx` is updated to the value of `x + dx`.
- `ny` is updated to the value of `y + dy`.

The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State incorporates the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**
