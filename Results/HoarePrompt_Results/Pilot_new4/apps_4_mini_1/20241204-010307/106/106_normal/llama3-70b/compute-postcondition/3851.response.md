Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` contains the tuple `(cur, i)` added during the loop execution, and `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged if `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` equals `i`, no changes occur to `dist[2]` or `parent[2]`.***
