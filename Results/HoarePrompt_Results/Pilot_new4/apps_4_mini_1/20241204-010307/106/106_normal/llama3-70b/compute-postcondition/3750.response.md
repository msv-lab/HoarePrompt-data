The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `parent` now has a specific value for the key `(2, ncur)` which equals `cur` and `piece`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
