The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `x` and `0` respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to `A[x][0]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, and we don't have specific values for `x` or `A`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x][0]**.
