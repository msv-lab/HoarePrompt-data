The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the previous initialization that states it is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. However, the variable `queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, but it can be assumed to exist in the context since it is being used for appending. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
