The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The previous state indicates that `queue` is empty and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. The states of `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged since the loop does not execute. 

The updated state reflects that `queue` now contains one element: the tuple `(cur, i)`.

Output State: **`dist[2][...]` contains the shortest path distances for reachable indices from the current position, `parent[2][...]` reflects the parent nodes for each updated index, `queue` contains one element `[(cur, i)]`, and `piece` is 2.**
