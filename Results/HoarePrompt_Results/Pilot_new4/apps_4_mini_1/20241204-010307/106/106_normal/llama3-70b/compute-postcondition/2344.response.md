The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the addition of `x` and `dx`, and `y` and `dy`, respectively. Since the states of `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` are not directly affected by this assignment, they remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the value of `ncur`, which is determined by the current values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`.**
