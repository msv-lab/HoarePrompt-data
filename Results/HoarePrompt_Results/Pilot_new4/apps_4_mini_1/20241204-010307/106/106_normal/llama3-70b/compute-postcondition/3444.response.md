The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and 0 to the `queue`. However, since `ncur` is undefined, this results in the tuple being `(undefined, 0)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is undefined; `dist[0][ncur]` assignment cannot be performed; `parent[0][ncur]` assignment cannot be performed due to `ncur` being undefined; `queue` now contains `(undefined, 0)`.**
