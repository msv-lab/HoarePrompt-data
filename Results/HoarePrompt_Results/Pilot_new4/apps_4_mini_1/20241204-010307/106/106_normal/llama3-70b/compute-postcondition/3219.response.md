The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`. The value assigned is `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which means `dist[2][ncur]` will now be one greater than `dist[2][cur]`. 

Since `dist[2][ncur]` is updated, we need to note the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` and that it is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions; `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
