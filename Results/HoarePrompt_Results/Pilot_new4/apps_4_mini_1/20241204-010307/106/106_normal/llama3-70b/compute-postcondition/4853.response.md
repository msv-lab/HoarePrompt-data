Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is the original x position, `y` is the original y position + 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1. The variable `piece` equals 1, and the distance from the first piece `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than the distance from the first piece at the current position `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
