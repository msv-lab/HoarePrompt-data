The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values based on the calculations `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variables `x` and `y` can have specific values, but they were not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `nx` and `ny` will be equal to \(x + dx\) and \(y + dy\), respectively. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `parent[0]` stores tuples of previous indices leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for each valid move that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
