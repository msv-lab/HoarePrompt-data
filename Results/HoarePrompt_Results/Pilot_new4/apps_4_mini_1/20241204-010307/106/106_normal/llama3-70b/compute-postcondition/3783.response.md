The code appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, but `ncur` is presumably defined somewhere in the code since it follows the other variable assignments. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ncur` is added to the `queue`, along with the value `0`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
