Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`. If `nx` is in the range [0, N) and `ny` is in the range [0, N), and if `piece` is 0 with `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions are not met, no changes are made.***
