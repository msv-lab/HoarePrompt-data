The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is `-2` and `ny` is `1`, the value of `ncur` will depend on the structure of the array `A`. However, since `N` is between 3 and 10, we can assume that array `A` has valid dimensions that correlate with this range. The values of `N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` is not empty; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`.**
