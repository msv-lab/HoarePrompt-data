Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` remain valid, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, with `dist[0][ncur]` previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`.**
