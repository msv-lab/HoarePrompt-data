The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged, but we now have an updated state for the `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[4 + dx][dy]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
