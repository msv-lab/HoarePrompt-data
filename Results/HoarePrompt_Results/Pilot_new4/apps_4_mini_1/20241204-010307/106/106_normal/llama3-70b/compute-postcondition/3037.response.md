The code assigns to `nx` and `ny` the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, so we don't have concrete values for `nx` and `ny`. However, we know that `nx` will be the result of adding `dx` to `x`, and `ny` will be the result of adding `dy` to `y`. The other variables remain unchanged as there are no further operations on them.

The output state will reflect that `nx` and `ny` depend on these calculations. The preconditions for `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` stores the shortest distances based on updates, `parent[1]` reflects predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all processed tuples. `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
