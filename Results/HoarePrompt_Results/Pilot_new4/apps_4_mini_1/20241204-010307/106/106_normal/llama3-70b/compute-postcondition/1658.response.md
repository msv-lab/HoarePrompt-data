To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we analyze the provided initial state and the line of code.

Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`.

In the code line `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, the value of `ncur` is assigned based on a lookup in the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`, which are not provided in the initial state. Thus, we cannot determine the specific value of `ncur` without knowing the contents of the array `A`.

However, we note that all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state needs to reflect the unchanged variables and the new assignment for `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
