The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `nx` is equal to `x`, and the variable `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, meaning that `ncur` will take the value from the array `A` at the row `x` and the column `y + 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`.**
