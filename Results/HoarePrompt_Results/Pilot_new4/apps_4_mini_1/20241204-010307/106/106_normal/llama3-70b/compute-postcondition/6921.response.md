The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The initial state states that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which means that `dist[0][cur]` must have had a specific value that made `dist[0][ncur]` greater before the operation. After the operation, `dist[0][ncur]` becomes exactly `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The states of the variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and the condition regarding `dist[0][ncur]` relative to `dist[0][cur]` are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
