According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional changes (`dx`, `dy`). This means that for each iteration of the loop, the values of `dx` and `dy` will change. The loop will execute a total of 8 times, once for each tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` values correspond to the last tuple in the list. The last tuple is `(2, 1)`, which means for the next iteration, the loop will pick the first tuple again, which is `(-2, -1)`. 

To summarize the states that need to be adjusted:
- The loop will start again from the first tuple, which are the values `dx = -2` and `dy = -1`.

Since the loop will continue to iterate through the list of directions, the states remain consistent. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, and the other variables do not change solely due to the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 4**
