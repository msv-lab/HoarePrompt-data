The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` will be `x + dx`, which is `0 + 0 = 0`, and `ny` will be `y + dy`, which is `2 + (-1) = 1`. The values of `N`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `cur`, `dist`, and `queue` remain unchanged as the code only modifies `nx` and `ny`.

After executing the code, we have:
- `nx` is 0
- `ny` is 1

The previous states of the other variables are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1.**
