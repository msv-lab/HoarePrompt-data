In the provided code, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values based on the operation `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0, `nx` will be `x + 1` and `ny` will remain the same as `y`, which is 2. 

The initial conditions are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is 2
- `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated
- `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`
- `dx` is 1
- `dy` is 0

Thus, after executing the code, the updated values will be:
- `nx` becomes `x + 1`
- `ny` remains 2

The Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated, `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0.**
