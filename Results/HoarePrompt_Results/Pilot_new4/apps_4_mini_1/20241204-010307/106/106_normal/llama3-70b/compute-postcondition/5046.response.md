Given the Initial State: If N is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][-1]`, `queue` contains (None, 1)

Analyzing the provided code snippet:

```
parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece
```

This line of code assigns a tuple to `parent[1][ncur]` where `cur` and `piece` are the two elements of the tuple. The variable `ncur` is previously assigned the value of `A[2][-1]`. The value of `cur` is not defined in the initial state but is assumed to be an integer.

After executing this line, `parent[1][ncur]` will now hold the tuple `(cur, piece)`, which is `(cur, 1)` since `piece` is defined as 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `If N is between 4 and 10, x is 3, y is 0, 0 <= nx < N, nx is 2, ny is -1, piece is 1, dist[1][ncur] is now equal to dist[1][cur] + 1, ncur is assigned the value of A[2][-1], queue contains (None, 1), and parent[1][ncur] is now equal to (cur, 1).`

Output State: **If N is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][-1]`, `queue` contains (None, 1), and `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to (cur, 1).**
