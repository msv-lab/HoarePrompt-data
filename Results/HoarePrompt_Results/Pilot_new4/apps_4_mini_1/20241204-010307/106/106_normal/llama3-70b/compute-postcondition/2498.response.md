The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the updated values of `x` and `y`. Given the initial values, we can determine the new values for `nx` and `ny`. 

1. `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, where `dx` is -1, meaning `nx = x - 1`.
2. `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`, where `dy` is 1, meaning `ny = y + 1`.

Substituting the values:
- Since `y` is initially 1, we have `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- The value of `x` is not explicitly defined, but `nx = x - 1`.

The initial state of the variables remains valid, and we only update `nx` and `ny`. 

Thus, the Output State is: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 2.**
