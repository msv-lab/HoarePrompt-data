Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2]` reflects the updated shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[2]` reflects the updated parent nodes relevant to valid moves, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` appended to it. If `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their original states.***
