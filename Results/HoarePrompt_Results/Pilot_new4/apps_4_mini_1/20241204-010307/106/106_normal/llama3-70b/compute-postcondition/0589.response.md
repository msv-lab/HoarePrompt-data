The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the direction offsets `dx` and `dy`. Since `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, and `y` is 0 (as given), the new coordinates will be determined by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1]` tracks the previous position and piece, `queue` must contain at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`.**
