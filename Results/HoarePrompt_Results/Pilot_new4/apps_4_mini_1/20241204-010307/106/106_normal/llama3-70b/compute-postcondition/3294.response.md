The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. The values of `dist[1][cur]` and `dist[1][ncur]` are dependent on their previous states, but since `dist[1][cur]` is unchanged, we cannot determine the exact value after execution without knowing it. Therefore, we can only state that `dist[1][ncur]` will be one more than whatever `dist[1][cur]` was.

Additionally, the other variables remain unchanged, and we know that `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`, which does not affect the output state directly in terms of values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` is unchanged; `queue` is unchanged; `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`.**
