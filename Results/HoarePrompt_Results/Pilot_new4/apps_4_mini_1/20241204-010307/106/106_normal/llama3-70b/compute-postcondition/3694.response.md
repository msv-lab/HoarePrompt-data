The code snippet `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value of the element at the position `[nx][ny]` in array `A` to `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are influenced by the expressions `nx = 2 + dx` and `ny = 0 + dy`. 

Given that the values of `dx` and `dy` are unspecified in the initial state, the exact values of `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined. However, we can represent them as:

- `nx` will be equal to `2 + dx`
- `ny` will be equal to `0 + dy`

The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the values of `nx` and `ny` after the calculations. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ncur` is now defined by the values of `nx` and `ny`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `piece` is 0; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
