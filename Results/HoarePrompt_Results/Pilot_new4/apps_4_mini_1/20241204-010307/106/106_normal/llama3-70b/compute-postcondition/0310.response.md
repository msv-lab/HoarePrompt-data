According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent directional changes (dx, dy). The loop will execute for each of these directional changes. Since there are 4 pairs in the list, and we focus on the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the current state of the loop.

The loop will have executed for the first three pairs of directions already, and we need to adjust for the fourth one. The loop will iterate through the pairs in the order they are provided. Assuming that the loop has executed for the first three pairs, upon completing the last iteration for the third pair `(1, 1)`, the loop will proceed to the next tuple, which is the fourth one.

Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, the loop will be ready to execute with the fourth pair of directions. The values of `dx` and `dy` will be set to the fourth tuple values `(-1, 1)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + (-1)`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).**
