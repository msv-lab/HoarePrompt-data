The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` have been previously defined: `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `4`. The value of `x` is within the range `0 <= x < N`, where `N` is an integer between `3` and `10`. Thus, `nx` will be within the range `1 <= nx <= 10`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
