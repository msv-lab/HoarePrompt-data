The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the displacements `dx` and `dy`. The initial values of `x` and `y` are known (`x` is 1 and `y` is 0). The exact values of `dx` and `dy` are not given, so we denote them as placeholders in the output. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, `queue` contains reachable positions, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.**
