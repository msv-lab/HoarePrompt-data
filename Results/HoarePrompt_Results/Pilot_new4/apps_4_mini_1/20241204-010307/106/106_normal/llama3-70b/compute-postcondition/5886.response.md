Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to the tuple `(cur, 0)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
