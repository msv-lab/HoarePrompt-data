Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, and `queue` is updated to include all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`.***
