The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is determined by the expression `x + dx`, and its previous state is valid with the condition that `0 <= nx < N`. Similarly, `ny` is determined by `y + dy` and is valid under the condition `0 <= ny < N`. The values of `ncur`, `nx`, and `ny` depend on the matrix `A` and the current values of `nx` and `ny`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
