The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the existing `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `parent` remain unchanged. The `queue` now contains an additional tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`, `(ncur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now one more than `dist[2][cur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`**.
