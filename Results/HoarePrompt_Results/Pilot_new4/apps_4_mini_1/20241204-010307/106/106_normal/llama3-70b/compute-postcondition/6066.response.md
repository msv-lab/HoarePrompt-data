The code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, which means that the variable `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the value of `cur`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `y` is 0
- `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`
- `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`

Now, after the code executes, the state of `parent[0][ncur]` changes, while all other variables remain as they were. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
