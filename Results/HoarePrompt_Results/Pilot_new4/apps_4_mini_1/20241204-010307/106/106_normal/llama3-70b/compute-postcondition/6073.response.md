Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, and `queue` must not be empty; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N` (i.e., 0 ≤ `nx` < `N` and 0 ≤ `ny` < `N`).***
