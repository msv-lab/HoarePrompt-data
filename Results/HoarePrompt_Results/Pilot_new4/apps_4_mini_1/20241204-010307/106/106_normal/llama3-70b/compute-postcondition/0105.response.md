The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `0` (the integer) are being added to the queue. 

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the state of the queue is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx` (undefined), `nx` is between 0 and N (exclusive), `ny` is between 0 and N (exclusive); `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`); `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
