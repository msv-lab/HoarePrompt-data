Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then if `piece` is 2 and `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distance from the position represented by `cur` to all valid `ncur` values, `parent[2][ncur]` records the corresponding `cur` and `piece` values for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` includes the previous elements plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`. If the condition is not met, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
