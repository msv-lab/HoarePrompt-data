The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are evaluated based on the initial state, but since `queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it exists and is either empty or has previous entries. 

The values of `ncur`, `2`, and the state of `queue` are the only things that change. The other variable states remain the same. Since `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 1][y]`, and we know that `ncur` is valid in the context of the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`.**
