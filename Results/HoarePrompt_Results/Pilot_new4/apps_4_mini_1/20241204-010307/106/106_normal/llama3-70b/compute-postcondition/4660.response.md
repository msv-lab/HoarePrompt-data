The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `x - 1` and `0`, respectively. The value of `N` remains unchanged, and the values of `y`, `dx`, and `dy` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`.**
