The `queue` list is updated to include a new tuple consisting of the values of `ncur` and `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `ncur` which is updated to `A[nx][ny]` and `piece` which is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated information is that `queue` now contains the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), `piece` equals 0, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned value of `cur`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
