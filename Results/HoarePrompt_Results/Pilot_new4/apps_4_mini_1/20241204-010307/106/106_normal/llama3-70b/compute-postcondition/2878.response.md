Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the conditions are not met, no actions are taken.***
