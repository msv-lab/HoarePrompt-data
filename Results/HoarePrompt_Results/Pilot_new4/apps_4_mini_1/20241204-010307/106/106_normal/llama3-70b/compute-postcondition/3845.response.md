The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The previous state of `queue` is not explicitly mentioned, but it is being updated with the new tuple without affecting the other variables. The values of `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `ncur`, and the contents of `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` includes the previous tuples plus `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is A[x + 1][y], `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur] = cur`.**
