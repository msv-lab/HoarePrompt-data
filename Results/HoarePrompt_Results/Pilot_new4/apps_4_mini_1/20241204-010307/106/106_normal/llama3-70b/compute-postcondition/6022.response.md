The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, but it is clear that `dist[2][ncur]` is being updated based on the distance at `cur` incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
