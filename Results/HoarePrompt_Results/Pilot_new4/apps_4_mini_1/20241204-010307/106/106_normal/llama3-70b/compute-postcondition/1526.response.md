The variable `queue` is updated to include a new tuple containing `ncur` and `piece`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and `piece` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but now `queue` contains one additional tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0 and now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`.**
