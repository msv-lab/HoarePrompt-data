Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no modifications are made.***
