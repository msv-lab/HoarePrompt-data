The statement `queue.append((cur, i))` adds the tuple `(cur, i)` to the list `queue`. The state of `cur` and `i` is not specified in the initial conditions, so we assume they hold their respective values. The other variables maintain their states as defined in the initial conditions.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest path distances for reachable states from `(x, y)` based on valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the previous positions for those states, `queue` now contains all reachable tuples from valid moves plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest path distances for reachable states from `(x, y)` based on valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the previous positions for those states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves plus the tuple `(cur, i)`, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
