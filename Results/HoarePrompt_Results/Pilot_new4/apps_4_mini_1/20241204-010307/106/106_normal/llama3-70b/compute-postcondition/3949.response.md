The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, which means they are valid indices for the array `A`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
