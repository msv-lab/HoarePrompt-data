The code `cur, piece = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the `queue`, which is currently `deque([(1, 3)])`. Therefore, `cur` will take the value `1` and `piece` will take the value `3`. The `queue` will now be empty after this operation.

The previous values of the affected variables were:
- `queue` was `deque([(1, 3)])`
- After the operation:
  - `cur` is assigned `1`
  - `piece` is assigned `3`
  - `queue` is now `deque([])`

The states of the other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10, dist contains the shortest distances from the starting position to all reachable positions based on piece types, parent reflects the predecessors for each reachable position and their corresponding piece values, i is 3, dist[3][1] is 0, queue is deque([]), cur is 1, piece is 3**.
