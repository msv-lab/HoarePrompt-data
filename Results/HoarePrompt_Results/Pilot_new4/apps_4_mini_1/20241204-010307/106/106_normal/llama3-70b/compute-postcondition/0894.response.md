According to the code, the loop will iterate over the tuple list containing pairs of `dx` and `dy`. Each time the loop executes, it will assign a new pair from the list to `dx` and `dy`. Given that there are 8 pairs in the list, for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next pair in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is the first element of the current pair, and `dy` is the second element of the current pair. Since the loop is iterating over 8 pairs, after the last executed pair (which will be the 8th pair), the next iteration of the loop will try to access the 9th pair, which doesn't exist.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update `dx` and `dy` to the next pair in the list. If the last executed pair was the 8th (the pair at index 7), the next `dx` and `dy` should be the first elements of the next pair (the loop starts again from the beginning).

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the first tuple, `dy` is the second element of the first tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`**
