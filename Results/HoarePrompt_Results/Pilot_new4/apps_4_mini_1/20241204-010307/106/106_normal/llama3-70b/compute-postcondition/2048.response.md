Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, `dx` and `dy` take on values from the tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], `nx` is `x + dx` for each `dx` value, and `ny` is `y + dy` for each `dy` value, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The current value of `piece` is 1, and the distance from `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
