`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Since `y` is equal to `N`, this means that `ny` will be equal to `N + dy`. The variables `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
