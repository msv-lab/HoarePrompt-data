The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `2 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, the exact values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. The state of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, and the queue remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the next pair of (dx, dy), and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the next pair of (dx, dy), `ncur` is assigned the value `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`.**
