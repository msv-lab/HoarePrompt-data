Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, `queue` contains the tuples representing all reachable points and their associated pieces after processing all valid moves defined by the `dx` and `dy` offsets, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
