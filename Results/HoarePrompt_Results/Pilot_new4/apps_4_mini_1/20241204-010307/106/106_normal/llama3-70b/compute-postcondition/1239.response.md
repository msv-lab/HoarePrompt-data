Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur in `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
