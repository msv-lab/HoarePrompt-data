The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The variable `y` is initially 2, and `x` is within bounds but its specific value is not given. Therefore, the value of `ny` becomes `2 + dy`. The value of `nx` becomes `x + dx`, where `dx` is also unspecified. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
