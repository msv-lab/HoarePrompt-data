According to the code, the for loop will execute over the list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], which contains four pairs of changes to the coordinates. The loop will execute regardless of the prior state of `N`, `x`, `y`, `A`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`, as the loop itself simply iterates over a fixed list of four pairs.

However, the variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the tuples during each iteration, and these values will be used in the loop body. Thus, there is no need to adjust any existing states for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1, dx and dy will iterate through the defined tuples in the loop.**
