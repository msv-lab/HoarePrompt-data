According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` includes all reachable tuples derived from the iterations, but we do not have information about whether `queue` is empty or not.

Since the condition is simply `while queue:`, we need to ensure that `queue` contains at least one element for the loop to execute again. Therefore, to allow for another iteration, `queue` must contain at least one reachable tuple.

There is no indication that any other states need to be adjusted based on the information provided. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist` contains the shortest path distances from the starting position for all valid reachable `ncur` values based on the piece type conditions; `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for those reachable `ncur`; `queue` must contain at least one reachable tuple**
