The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 1, `nx` becomes `x + 1` and `ny` becomes `0 + 1` (since `y` is initialized to 0). Therefore, `ny` will be 1. The value of `nx` will depend on the current value of `x`, which is not specified but remains unchanged in the output state. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1**.
