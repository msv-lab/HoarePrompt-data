The code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged as the operation does not affect them directly. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new assignment in `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `piece` is 1; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 5; `ny` is 2; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.**
