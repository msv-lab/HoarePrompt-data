Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` now contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1) and (ncur, 2). If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` becomes `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
