The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` now holds the value from the array `A` at the indexed position of `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain unchanged, and we know that `N` is at least 4 and `piece` remains determined by the loop conditions.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains determined by the loop conditions, `y` is still 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**.
