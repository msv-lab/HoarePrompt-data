The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, we can state that `dist[2][ncur]` is now `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unaffected, and we maintain the constraints provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is the current value of `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`.**
