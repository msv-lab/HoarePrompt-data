The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. This modifies the `queue` variable but does not affect any of the other initial state variables. The previous values of the variables remain valid, and the change is specific to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the minimum distances updated based on valid moves from the initial state, `parent[1]` contains the connections made for valid moves, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
