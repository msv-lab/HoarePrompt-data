Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; if `nx` is within the bounds [0, N) and `ny` is within the bounds [0, N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state. If `nx` or `ny` are out of bounds, there are no changes made to the state.***
