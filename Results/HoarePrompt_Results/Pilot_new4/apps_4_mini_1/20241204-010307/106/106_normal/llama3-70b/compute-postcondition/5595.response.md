The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `dx` is 1 and the value of `dy` is 0, so `nx` becomes `x + 1` and `ny` becomes `y`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`; `piece` is 2; the next (dx, dy) will be (1, 0).
