The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are added to the queue, which means `queue` will now have an additional entry.

In the initial state, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`, where `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, and `y` is between `1` and `N-1`. The variable `2` is a constant value and does not change.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes a tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
