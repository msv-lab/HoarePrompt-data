Postcondition: ***If `N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `x` is at least 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 3, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][3]`, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `parent` or `queue`.***
