Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
