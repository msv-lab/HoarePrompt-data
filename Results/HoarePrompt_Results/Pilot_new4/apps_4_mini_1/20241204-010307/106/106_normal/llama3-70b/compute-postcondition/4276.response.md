The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are taken directly from the previous state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `ncur = A[1 + dx][N - 1 + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**
