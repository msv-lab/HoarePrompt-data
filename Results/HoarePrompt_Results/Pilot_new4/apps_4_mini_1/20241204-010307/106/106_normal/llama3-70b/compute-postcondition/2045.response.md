In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the tuples `dx` and `dy`. The tuples represent directional changes to the coordinates `(x, y)`. Specifically, for every pair in `dx` and `dy`, `nx` and `ny` will be calculated as follows:

- For the tuple `(-1, -1)`, `nx = x - 1` and `ny = y - 1`.
- For the tuple `(-1, 1)`, `nx = x - 1` and `ny = y + 1`.
- For the tuple `(1, -1)`, `nx = x + 1` and `ny = y - 1`.
- For the tuple `(1, 1)`, `nx = x + 1` and `ny = y + 1`.

The exact values of `nx` and `ny` after executing this code depend on the values of `x` and `y` which are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the relationships.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, `dx` and `dy` will take on values from the tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], `nx` is `x + dx` for each `dx` value, and `ny` is `y + dy` for each `dy` value.**
