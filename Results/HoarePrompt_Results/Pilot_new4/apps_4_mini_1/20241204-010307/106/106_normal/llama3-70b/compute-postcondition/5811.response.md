In the provided code, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given the initial values, `x` is 1, `dx` is -1, `y` is 0, and `dy` is -1. Therefore, the calculations are as follows:

- `nx = 1 + (-1) = 0`
- `ny = 0 + (-1) = -1`

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1.**
