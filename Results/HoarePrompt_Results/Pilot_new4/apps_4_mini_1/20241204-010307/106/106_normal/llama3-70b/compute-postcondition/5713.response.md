The assignments in the code will update `nx` and `ny` based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

1. `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, where `x` is `0` and `dx` is `-2`. Therefore, `nx` becomes `0 + (-2) = -2`.
2. `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, where `y` is `2` and `dy` is `-1`. Therefore, `ny` becomes `2 + (-1) = 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:
`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` is not empty; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` is not empty; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1.**
