According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of `(dx, dy)` which represent the four possible diagonal movements. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next pair of `(dx, dy)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` would have taken the values from the current tuple in the list, and for the next iteration, they will take the values from the subsequent tuple.

The state variables are as follows:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, which does not change during the iterations.
- `y` is the current y-coordinate, which remains the same unless altered in the loop body.
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, which changes with each iteration based on the current `dx`.
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, which changes with each iteration based on the current `dy`.
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which will also change based on the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Therefore, once the current `(dx, dy)` pair is used, for the loop to execute again, it simply needs to move to the next pair. 

In this case, since the loop iterates over the four pairs, after the last iteration with the last pair `(1, 1)`, the next iteration would begin. Thus, the first pair `(-1, -1)` would be processed again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for the next pair, `ny` is equal to `y + dy` for the next pair, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` for the next pair.**
