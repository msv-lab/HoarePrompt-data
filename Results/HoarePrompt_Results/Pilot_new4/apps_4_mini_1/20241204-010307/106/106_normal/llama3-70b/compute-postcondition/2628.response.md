The code appends the tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The `queue` now contains an additional element, which is the tuple created from the current values of `cur` and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged in their states, as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances from `cur` to each valid `ncur` position for all reachable positions, `parent[2][ncur]` indicates the parent positions and pieces leading to each `ncur`, `queue` now contains the previously reachable tuples along with the new tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
