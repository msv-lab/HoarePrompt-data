The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, with an additional value `piece`. The state of the parent array is updated for the specific indices. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices and now includes `parent[1][ncur]` = `cur`, `piece`, `queue` is unchanged, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices including `parent[1][ncur]` = `cur`, `piece`, `queue` is unchanged, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
