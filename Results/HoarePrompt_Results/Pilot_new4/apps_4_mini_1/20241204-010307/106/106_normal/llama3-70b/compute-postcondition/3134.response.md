The code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` attempts to assign a value from a two-dimensional array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. However, the variables `nx` and `ny` are currently undefined. As a result, the code would not successfully execute due to the undefined variables.

Thus, the Output State will indicate that `nx` and `ny` remain undefined, affecting the operation to assign a value to `ncur`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `nx` is undefined, `ny` is undefined, `ncur` is undefined**.
