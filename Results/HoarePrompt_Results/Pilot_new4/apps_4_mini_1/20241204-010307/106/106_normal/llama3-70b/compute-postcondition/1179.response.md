The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `1` (which is a literal) are included in the tuple. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `ncur` is determined based on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The other preconditions are still valid after the code execution, but the state of the `queue` is modified.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is either 0 or 2, `ny` is either 0 or 2 depending on the values taken from `dx` and `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
