The `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, representing the current position `ncur` and the new piece type `2`. The other variables remain unaffected as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for all valid moves and now includes `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N-1`; `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and is greater than its previous value; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
