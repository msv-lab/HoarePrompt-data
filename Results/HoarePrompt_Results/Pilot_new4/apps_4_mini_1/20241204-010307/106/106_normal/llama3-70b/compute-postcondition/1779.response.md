The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` will be inserted into the queue data structure. The states of the other variables remain unchanged after this operation. 

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 4` and `ny` is `3`, the exact value of `ncur` depends on the values present in array `A` at those indices. 

Therefore, the output state describes the unchanged state of the other variables along with the addition of the tuple to the queue.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
