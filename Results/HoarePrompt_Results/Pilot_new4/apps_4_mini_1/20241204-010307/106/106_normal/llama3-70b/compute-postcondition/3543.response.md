Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the previous positions plus the new position `(ncur, 1)`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for reachable positions, while `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged for any unreachable positions; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
