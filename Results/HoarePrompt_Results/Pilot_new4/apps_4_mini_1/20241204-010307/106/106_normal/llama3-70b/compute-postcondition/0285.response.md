The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since `y` is 0, `ny` would be equal to `dy`. Therefore, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `dy`. The actual content of `A[nx][ny]` will depend on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
