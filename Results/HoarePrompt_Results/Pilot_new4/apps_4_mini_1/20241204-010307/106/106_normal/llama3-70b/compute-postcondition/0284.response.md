The code snippet assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Given the initial state, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and `ny` as `y + dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, the outcome of `nx` and `ny` depends on their values.

Additionally, the conditional checks for `nx` and `ny` being within the bounds of `0` and `N - 1` remain valid as part of the state but are not updated in this step. The other variables `N`, `y`, `A[x][0]`, `cur`, and the tuple being processed are unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the next tuple `(-2, 1)` is being processed.**
