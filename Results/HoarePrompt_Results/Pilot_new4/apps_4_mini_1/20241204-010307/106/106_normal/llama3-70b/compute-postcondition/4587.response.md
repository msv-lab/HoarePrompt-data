The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the element `parent[1][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, which is part of the previous state. The other variables remain unchanged. The preconditions still hold, with the exception of the updated value of `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[0]` contains parent relationships for valid moves; `queue` contains potential next states; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur] is now equal to (cur, piece)**.
