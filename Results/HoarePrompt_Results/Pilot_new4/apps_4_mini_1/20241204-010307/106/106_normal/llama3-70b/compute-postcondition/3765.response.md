Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0; if `piece` is not equal to `i`, the pair `(cur, i)` is appended to `queue`, and `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states if the loop does not execute. If the loop executes, `dist[2][ncur]` will contain the updated distances based on the conditions met during the iterations, `parent[2][ncur]` will reflect the paths taken to those positions, and `queue` will contain all valid pairs based on successful updates. If `piece` equals `i`, no changes occur.***
