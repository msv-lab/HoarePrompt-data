Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-2][1]`. If `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned an undefined value from `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the variables.***
