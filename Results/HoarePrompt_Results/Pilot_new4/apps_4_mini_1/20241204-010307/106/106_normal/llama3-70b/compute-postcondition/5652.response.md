Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `queue` may contain multiple elements including `(ncur, 1)` which is appended; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]` (where `nx` is 1 and `ny` is 2); `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `dx` and `dy` have been assigned `(1, 1)` in the last iteration.***
