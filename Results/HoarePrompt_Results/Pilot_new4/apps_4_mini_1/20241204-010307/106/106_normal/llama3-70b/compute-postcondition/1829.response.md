The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` using the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. 

Given:
- `dx` is -1, so `nx` becomes `x - 1`.
- `dy` is 0, so `ny` remains `y` which is 2.

Thus, after executing the code, the variables are updated as follows:
- `nx` is now `x - 1`.
- `ny` is now `2`.

The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, and the conditions regarding `ncur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 2; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` holds true, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
