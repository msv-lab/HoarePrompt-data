Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
