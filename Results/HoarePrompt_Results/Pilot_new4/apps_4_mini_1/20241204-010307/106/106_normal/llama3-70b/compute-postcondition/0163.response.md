The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and since `dx` is -1, this means `nx` will be `x - 1`. The value of `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, and since `dy` is 0, this means `ny` will remain equal to `y`.

The previous values of the variables are still valid, but we need to update `nx` and `ny` based on the calculations:

- `nx` becomes `x - 1`
- `ny` remains `y` (as `dy` is 0)

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y`.**
