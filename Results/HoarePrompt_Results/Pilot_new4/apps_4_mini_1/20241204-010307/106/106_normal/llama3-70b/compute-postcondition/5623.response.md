The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state should reflect that `queue` now contains an additional element, while the rest of the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty and now includes `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
