The line of code updates the `dist` array at index `[0][ncur]` to be equal to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

1. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value stored in `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated based on its current value, which is determined by `cur`. 
2. The value of `cur` remains unchanged.
3. The other variables (`N`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`) retain their previous states except for `dist[0][ncur]`, which is updated.

The previous value of `dist[0][cur]` is added by 1 and assigned to `dist[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is 0; `cur` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
