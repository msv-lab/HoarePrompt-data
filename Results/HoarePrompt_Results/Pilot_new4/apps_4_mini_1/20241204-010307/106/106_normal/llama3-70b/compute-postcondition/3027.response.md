According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs `(dx, dy)` which are used for potential movement or direction changes in the algorithm. The loop will execute for each of the four pairs in the list `[( -1, -1), ( -1, 1), ( 1, -1), ( 1, 1)]`. Since the loop will run four times, and we are considering the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine which iteration we are currently on.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 1 and `piece` is 1. The loop has not completed all of its iterations yet. Given that there are four pairs, we can assume that after the third iteration, the current index would be 3 (the pairs at the indices are zero-based).

Thus, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop, which would be the fourth pair `(1, 1)`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1**
