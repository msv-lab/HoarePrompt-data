According to the code, the loop will execute a fixed number of times based on the given iterable list of tuples. The number of iterations is determined by the length of the list, which is 8 in this case. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take values from the tuples in the list during each iteration. 

The states that need to be understood and potentially adjusted for the loop to execute are the values of `dx` and `dy` during the first iteration. Since the loop is not dependent on `N`, `x`, or `y`, those values do not affect the loop execution but may be relevant for the loop body itself.

At the start of the first iteration, `dx` will be `-2` and `dy` will be `-1` from the first tuple. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop state are as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
