The operation `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the value of `dist[0][cur]`. Since the initial state specifies that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this assignment indicates that the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` is being adjusted to a new value which is one greater than the value of `dist[0][cur]`.

Given this, the output state reflects the new relationship established by the assignment, while the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, the value of `dist[0][ncur]` now equals `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, both `nx` is between 0 and N-1 (inclusive) and `ny` is between 0 and N-1 (inclusive), the value of `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
