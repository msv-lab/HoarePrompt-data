Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 3, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, if the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
