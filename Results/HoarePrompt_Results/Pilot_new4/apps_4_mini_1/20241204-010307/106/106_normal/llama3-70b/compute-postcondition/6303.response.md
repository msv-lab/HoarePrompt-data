To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the `queue`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `queue`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the `queue` contains all tuples of `(ncur, piece)` that have been processed. If the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` would remain unchanged, and `queue` would have one less valid tuple than before.

The current state indicates that `queue` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to run again. However, we don't have the exact number of tuples in `queue` at the end of the last iteration, only that it reflects all valid moves made by the pieces.

Since the loop relies on `queue` being non-empty, for the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must contain at least one valid tuple. If there were no valid moves processed, then the `queue` could potentially be empty.

Thus, we need to ensure that `queue` must still contain at least one valid tuple. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `queue` should have at least one tuple in it.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dist` contains the minimum distances from `cur` to all reachable positions for each piece type, `parent` holds the predecessor tuples for all reachable positions corresponding to their respective piece states, and `queue` must contain at least one valid tuple**.
