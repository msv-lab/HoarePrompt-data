The code assigns a value to `parent[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is equal to `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are preserved, and since `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`, it reflects the current state of `cur` and the value of `piece`. The other variables such as `N`, `y`, `A`, `cur`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`**.
