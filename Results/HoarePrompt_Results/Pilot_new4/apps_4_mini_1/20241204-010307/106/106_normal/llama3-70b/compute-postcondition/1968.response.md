According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the direction deltas `[(dx, dy)]`. Each iteration will update the current state based on the values of `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 4. This means the range for `nx` and `ny` is valid as long as the calculated indices fall within bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. As the loop iterates over the direction deltas, it will execute four times (once for each tuple). 

Since there are four tuples in the list, after the last iteration, the loop will have executed all its iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to consider that it will need to be re-invoked, but the loop's internal state itself will not change unless it is called again from outside.

Thus, the state at the start of the loop must reflect that it will now begin from the first tuple again, with no updates to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`, since the iteration conditions do not change.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` is unchanged**
