The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, but they will determine the values of `nx` and `ny`. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1); `dist[1][ncur]` is updated accordingly; `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
