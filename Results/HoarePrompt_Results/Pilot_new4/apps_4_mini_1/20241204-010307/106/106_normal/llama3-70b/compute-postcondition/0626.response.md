The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not given in the initial state, so they remain unspecified. The states of all other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], the value of `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
