Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur` and `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains tuples including `(cur, i)` added to it while `dist`, `parent`, and other variables remain unchanged. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their original state.***
