Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` contains all reachable tuples from the valid moves plus `(ncur, 1)`. Additionally, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
