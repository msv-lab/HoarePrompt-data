The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to the position `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are added to the `parent` array at the indices `1` and `ncur`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all other variables, while `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to the tuple `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][1 + dy]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
