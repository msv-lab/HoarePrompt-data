Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 10, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 to `N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][10]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not satisfied, no actions are performed.***
