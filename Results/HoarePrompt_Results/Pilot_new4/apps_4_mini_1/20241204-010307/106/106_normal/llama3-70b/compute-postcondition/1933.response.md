Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` remains unchanged, `piece` is unchanged, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` is less than `N`***
