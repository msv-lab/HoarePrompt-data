The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` sets the value of `parent[1][ncur]` to a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, after the execution of this code, the values of `parent[1][ncur]` will be updated accordingly, while all other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**
