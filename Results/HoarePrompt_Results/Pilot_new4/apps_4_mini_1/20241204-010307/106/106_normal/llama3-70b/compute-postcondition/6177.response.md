To determine the output state after executing the code snippet provided, we first analyze the given initial state.

Initial State: 
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `y` is 1.
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`.
- `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.

The code snippet:
```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```

Here, `ncur` is assigned the value of the element at the position `[nx][ny]` in the 2D array `A`. 

Since `nx` is determined by the expression `x + dx - 1`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, we can infer that `ncur` will now hold the value of `A[x + dx - 1][1 + dy]`. We do not have specific values for `x`, `dx`, or `dy` from the initial state, but we recognize that `nx` and `ny` depend on these variables.

The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, while `ncur` is newly calculated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
