The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are computed as `2 + dx` and `0 + dy`, respectively. The values of `nx` and `ny` must satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The original values for `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `nx`, and `ny` remain valid. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
