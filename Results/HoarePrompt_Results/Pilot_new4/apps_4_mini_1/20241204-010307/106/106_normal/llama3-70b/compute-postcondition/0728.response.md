The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Thus, the output state reflects that `parent[0][ncur]` is now set to the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`.**
