Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable nodes that correspond to the `dx` and `dy` movements. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to N-1 (inclusive).***
