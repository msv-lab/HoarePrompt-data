The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are unchanged, but the state of `parent` is affected by this assignment.

The other variables retain their previous values or statements as per the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
