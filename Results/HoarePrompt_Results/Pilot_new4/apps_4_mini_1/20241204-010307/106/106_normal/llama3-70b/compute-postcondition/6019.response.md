According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of directional changes represented by `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list, which contains four tuples total. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, meaning the loop has executed once for the first direction. The next direction in the list is `(1, 0)`, which will be handled in the next iteration.

Since the loop is iterating over the fixed list of directions, and there are three more directions to process, I need to adjust `dx` and `dy` to reflect the current state as it prepares for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0**
