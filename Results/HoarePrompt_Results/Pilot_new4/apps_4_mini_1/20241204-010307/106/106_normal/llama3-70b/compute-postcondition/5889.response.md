The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial conditions also state that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), and `ny` is between 1 and 15 (inclusive). However, the array `A` and the specific values for `nx` and `ny` are not provided, so we cannot determine a specific output for `ncur`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ncur` now holds a value dependent on the indices `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ny` is between 1 and 15 (inclusive), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
