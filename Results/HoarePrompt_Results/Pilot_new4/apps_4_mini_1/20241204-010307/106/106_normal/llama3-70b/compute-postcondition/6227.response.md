To analyze the given Python code snippet, we start with the initial state:

- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `y` is 2.
- `dx` is -2.
- `dy` is 1.
- `nx` is equal to `x - 2`.
- `ny` is 1.

Now, let's evaluate the code snippet:

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

This line assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. 

1. **Calculating the new value of `nx`:**
   - From the initial state, `dx` is -2.
   - Therefore, `nx` becomes `x + dx`, which is `x - 2`. 
   - This matches the initial state of `nx`, so we can replace `nx` with `x - 2`.

2. **Calculating the new value of `ny`:**
   - From the initial state, `y` is 2 and `dy` is 1.
   - Therefore, `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

To summarize:
- The value of `nx` remains `x - 2`.
- The value of `ny` is updated to 3.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect these updated values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ny` is 3.**
