The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The preconditions for the other variables remain valid. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` is not empty; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
