Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains path information for valid `ncur`; `queue` now contains all applicable tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where `piece` is 1 and also includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.***
