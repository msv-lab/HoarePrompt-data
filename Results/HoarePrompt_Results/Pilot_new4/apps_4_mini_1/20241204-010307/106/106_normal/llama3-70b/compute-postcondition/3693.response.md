In the provided code, `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The initial values are `x` is 2, `y` is 0, and we do not have specific values for `dx` and `dy`, but they must be valid for the calculations. The calculations for `nx` and `ny` are as follows:

- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which means `nx` will be equal to `2 + dx`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which means `ny` will be equal to `0 + dy`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `piece` is 0**
