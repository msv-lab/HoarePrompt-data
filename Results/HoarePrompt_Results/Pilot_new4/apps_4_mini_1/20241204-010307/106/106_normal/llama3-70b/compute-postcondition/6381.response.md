The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` are both 0, while `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, but they will determine the new coordinates. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, and the initial values of `queue`, `dist[0]`, and `parent[0]` remain unchanged, only the new values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `dx` and `dy`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `nx` and `ny` are now defined based on the operation performed on `x` and `y`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.**
