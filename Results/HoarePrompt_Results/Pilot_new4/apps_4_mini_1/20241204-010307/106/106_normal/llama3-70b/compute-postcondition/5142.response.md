The operation `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` based on the current distance `dist[2][cur]`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, it implies that the new value will be lesser than the current value of `dist[2][ncur]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and we can summarize the impact as follows: 

- The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
```
`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now less than its previous value.
```

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`.**
