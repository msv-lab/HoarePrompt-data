Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist` reflects the updated distances, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece` remains 1, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If `piece` is not equal to 1 or the distance condition is not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
