The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `x` is currently 0 and `y` is currently 2. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact new values for `nx` and `ny`. The states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist` and `parent` are ready for updates based on the loop conditions, `queue` can be empty initially or filled based on the loop execution.**
