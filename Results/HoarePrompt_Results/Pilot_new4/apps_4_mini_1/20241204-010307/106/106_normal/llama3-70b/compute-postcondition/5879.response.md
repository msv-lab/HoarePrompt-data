According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in this list. At the end of the previous iteration, `dx` and `dy` corresponded to the last tuple in the list, which is `(2, 1)`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to move to the next tuple in the list. Since we are at the last tuple `(2, 1)`, we need to reset to the first tuple in the list for the iteration to continue. 

Thus, for the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take on the values of the first tuple in the list, which is `(-2, -1)`. There is no change needed for `N`, `y`, `nx`, or `ny`, as they remain the same.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + (-2)`; `ny` is equal to `y + (-1)`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
