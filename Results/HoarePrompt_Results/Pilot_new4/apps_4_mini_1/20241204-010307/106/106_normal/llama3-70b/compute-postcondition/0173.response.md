The code updates the `dist` matrix by setting `dist[2][ncur]` to the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, meaning that `ncur` holds a value that corresponds to the element in array `A` at indices `nx` and `ny`. The variables `dist`, `cur`, and the indices involved in `dist` are not specified, but the change occurs at `dist[2][ncur]`.

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation, so the output state reflects the information provided without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
