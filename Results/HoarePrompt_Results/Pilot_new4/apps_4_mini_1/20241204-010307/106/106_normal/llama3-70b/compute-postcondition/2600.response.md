According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `[(−1,0), (1,0), (0,−1), (0,1)]`, which means it will execute four times regardless of the values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as it is reached in the program flow. 

The key states to check are whether the loop body relies on the variables being in certain states, but the loop will execute without any specific requirements on those variables. 

Given that the loop iterates over fixed tuples and does not depend on the values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` to execute, we can assert:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains minimum distances from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates parents for each `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable tuples `(ncur, 1)`**
