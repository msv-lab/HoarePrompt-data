To determine the new state after executing the code, we analyze how the assignment affects the variables `nx` and `ny`. The code snippet provided is:

```python
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

However, the values for `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Hence, we cannot definitively calculate the new values of `nx` and `ny`. Regardless, we can state that `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

In the initial state:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is 0
- `ny` is 2

After executing the code, we will have:

- `nx` will be updated to `x + dx`, the specific value of which depends on `dx` (unknown).
- `ny` will be updated to `y + dy`, the specific value of which depends on `dy` (unknown).

Thus, the output state will include the unchanged variables and indicate that `nx` and `ny` have been updated based on the current values of `x` and `y` plus their respective deltas.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is updated to `2 + dx`, `ny` is updated to `1 + dy`**
