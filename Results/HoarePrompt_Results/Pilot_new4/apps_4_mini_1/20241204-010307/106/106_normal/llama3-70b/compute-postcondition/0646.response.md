Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, all possible values of `nx` and `ny` have been checked for validity, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distances calculated from the current position `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` contains the relationships of each position to its predecessor, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` entries added throughout the iterations.**
