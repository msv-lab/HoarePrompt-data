The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this means the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which satisfies the condition. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
