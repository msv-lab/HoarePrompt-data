The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the number `2` are added to the queue, but no other variables are affected. The state of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x`; `ny` is between 1 and 9 (inclusive); `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` has a new element `(ncur, 2)`.**
