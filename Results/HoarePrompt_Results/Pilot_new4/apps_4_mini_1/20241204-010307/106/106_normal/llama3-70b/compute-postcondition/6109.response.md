`nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, where `dx` is -1, thus `nx` becomes `x - 1`. Similarly, `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`, where `dy` is 0, so `ny` remains equal to `y`. The initial conditions for `N`, `y`, `x`, `A`, `cur`, and `dist` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`.
