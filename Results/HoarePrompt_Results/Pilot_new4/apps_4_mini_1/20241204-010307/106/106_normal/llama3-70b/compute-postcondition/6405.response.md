In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. We already know that `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is 1. 

Calculating the new values:
- For `nx`: 
  - `nx = x + dx`
  - `nx = 0 + (-2) = -2`
- For `ny`: 
  - `ny = y + dy`
  - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

The variables `N`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `ncur` remain unchanged after this execution.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is undefined.**
