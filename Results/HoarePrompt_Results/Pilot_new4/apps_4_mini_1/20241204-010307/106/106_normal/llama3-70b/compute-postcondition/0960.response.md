The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the position `[2][ncur]` in the `parent` array. Here, no other variables are directly affected. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged. The only new information is the assignment to `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
