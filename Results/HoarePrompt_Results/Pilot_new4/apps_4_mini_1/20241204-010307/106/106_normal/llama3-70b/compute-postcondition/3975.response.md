Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances, `parent[0]` contains parent information, `queue` is empty; `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, with `dx`, `dy` taking values from the list over 4 iterations. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
