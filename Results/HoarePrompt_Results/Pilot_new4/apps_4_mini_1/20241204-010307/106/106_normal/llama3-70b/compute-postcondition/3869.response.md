The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing the current value of `ncur` and `0` to the list `queue`. None of the other variables are directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `nx` is `x + dx`
- `ny` is `y + dy`
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `parent[0][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur and piece`
- `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur and piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**
