The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` become `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial conditions of the other variables (`N`, `piece`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`) remain unchanged.

Since the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist` remains as it is, `parent` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged.**
