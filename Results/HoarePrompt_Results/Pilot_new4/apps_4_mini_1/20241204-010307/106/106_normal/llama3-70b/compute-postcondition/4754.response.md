According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in this list. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will correspond to the last tuple in the list, which is `(2, 1)`. 

Since this is the last tuple in the list, for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to start from the first tuple again. This means that `dx` and `dy` should be reset to the first tuple `(-2, -1)`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**.
