Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` and `dy` are each taken from the list of tuples for all possible moves; `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on `x` and the values of `dx` and `dy`; `ncur` will have the values from `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` and `ny` are within bounds; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated, `parent[0][ncur]` will be set accordingly, and `queue` will contain tuples of updated `ncur` values with `0`, otherwise no changes will occur.**
