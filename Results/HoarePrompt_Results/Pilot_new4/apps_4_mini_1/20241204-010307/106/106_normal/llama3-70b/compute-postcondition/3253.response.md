Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than the previous value `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**
