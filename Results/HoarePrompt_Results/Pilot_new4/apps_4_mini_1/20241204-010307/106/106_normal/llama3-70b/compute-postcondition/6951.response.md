Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, and `piece` is 1. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 1)` is added to the `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
