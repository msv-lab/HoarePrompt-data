The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, combined with the values of `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot definitively determine the new values of `nx` and `ny`. However, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`**
