The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The initial state indicates that the distance from `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, meaning after this operation, the condition will no longer hold true. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
