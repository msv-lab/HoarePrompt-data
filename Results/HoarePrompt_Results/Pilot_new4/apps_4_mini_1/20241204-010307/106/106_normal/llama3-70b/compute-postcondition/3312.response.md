The line of code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny` to the variable `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the precondition, where `nx` is `0 + dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`. As `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the precondition, we cannot derive specific numeric values for `nx` and `ny`. However, their expressions are defined.

The assignment affects only the variable `ncur`. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` will have no changes unless the condition holds true, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
