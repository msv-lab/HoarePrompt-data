According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]` which contains four pairs representing directions. The loop will execute regardless of the prior state, as it does not depend on any of the variables `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.

However, for the loop to make meaningful updates within its body (though not specified here), we should ensure that `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid structures that can be utilized based on the given `(dx, dy)` tuples. Given that `dist` and `parent` may have been updated for valid `ncur` positions and `queue` contains valid positions, we can confirm that these states are appropriate for the loop to execute.

Since there are no additional conditions provided that would prevent the loop from executing given the initial state, we can state that the loop will run without the need to change any states related to `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions, `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid positions**
