The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not changed, and other variables remain unaffected. 

Thus, the output state maintains the initial conditions, with the addition of the assignment to the `parent` array:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
