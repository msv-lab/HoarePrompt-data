Given the initial state where `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, and `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, we execute the line:

```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```

In this context, `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position indexed by `nx` and `ny`. Since `nx` is -1 and `ny` is 2, the value of `ncur` will be whatever `A[-1][2]` evaluates to.

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. The only variable that is updated is `ncur`.

As `A` is not defined in the given state, we cannot derive a specific value for `ncur`, but we denote it as `A[-1][2]`.

Thus, the output state reflects the valid preconditions and updates the value of `ncur`:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`.**
