The code calculates the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the current coordinates `(x, y)` and the directional offsets `(dx, dy)`. The values of `dx` and `dy` come from a predefined list of tuples representing the four possible directions (up, down, left, right). The `nx` and `ny` are derived by adding the corresponding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`.

Since the initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, and `y` is updated based on reachable cells, the specific values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` will determine the new coordinates.

However, without specific values for `x`, `y`, or the current direction being used (i.e., the specific `(dx, dy)` from the list), we can only express `nx` and `ny` as follows:

- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is updated based on the reachable cells from (x, y); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**
