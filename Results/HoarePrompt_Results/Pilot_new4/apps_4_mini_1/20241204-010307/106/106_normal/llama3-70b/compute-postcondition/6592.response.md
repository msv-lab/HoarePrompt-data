The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is determined from the earlier computations, but since no specific value is provided for `ncur`, we will maintain its expression.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `index` is 1
- `nx` is `1 + dx`
- `ny` is `0 + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`

Since the `queue` variable is being modified by appending `(ncur, 0)`, it is the only change that we need to reflect in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `index` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
