The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. 

- The value of `x` is 2, and `dx` is -2. Thus, `nx` becomes `2 + (-2) = 0`.
- The value of `y` is 0, and `dy` is -1. Thus, `ny` becomes `0 + (-1) = -1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions, `queue` contains all reachable tuples, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions, `queue` contains all reachable tuples, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1.**
