Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions, `parent[1][ncur]` contains associated parent positions, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` retains updated parent positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and newly appended tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid knight move, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (`0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`).***
