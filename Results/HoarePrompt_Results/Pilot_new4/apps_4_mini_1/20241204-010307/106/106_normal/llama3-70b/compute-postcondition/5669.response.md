The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is equal to 2. The state of the other variables does not change.

Given that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, which would now also include `(ncur, 2)`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is `dx`
- `ny` is `1 + dy`
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is equal to 2
- `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`
- `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`

The only change in the state is the addition of the tuple to `queue`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
