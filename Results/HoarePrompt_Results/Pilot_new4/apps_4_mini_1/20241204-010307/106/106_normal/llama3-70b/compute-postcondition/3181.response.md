The code attempts to assign the value `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. However, since `ncur` is unspecified due to invalid index access, this assignment cannot be completed successfully. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `A[0][0]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged as a result of the code execution.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -2, and `ncur` is unspecified due to invalid index access.**
