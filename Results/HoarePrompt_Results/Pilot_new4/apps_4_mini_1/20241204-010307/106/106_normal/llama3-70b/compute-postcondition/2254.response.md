Postcondition: ***`piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur`, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`.***
