The line of code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value from the 2D list (or array) `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny` to the variable `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. 

Since `dist`, `piece`, and `queue` are not directly affected by this line of code, their values remain the same. However, `ncur` will now hold the value of the specific element from `A` at the calculated indices.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `piece` is 0; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
