Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 0; `dx` is not applicable; `dy` is not applicable; if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[0][0]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. If these conditions are not met, there are no changes to the state.***
