The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Given the initial state, `x` is 1 and `dx` is -2, so:

- `nx = 1 + (-2) = -1`
  
For `ny`, since `y` is 0 and `dy` is 1:

- `ny = 0 + 1 = 1`

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 1.**
