To analyze the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -2
- `nx` is equal to `x - 4`
- `ny` is 2

Now we look at the code:

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Here, `nx` and `ny` are being updated based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`.

- `dx` is -1, which means when added to `x`, it effectively decreases `x` by 1: `nx = x - 1`.
- `dy` is -2, so adding it to `y` modifies `y`: `ny = 1 - 2 = -1`.

Now, we need to update the state with these new values:

- `nx` is now `x - 1`.
- `ny` is now -1.

The other variables retain their previous values, so we restate them in the output.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is -1.**
