Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
