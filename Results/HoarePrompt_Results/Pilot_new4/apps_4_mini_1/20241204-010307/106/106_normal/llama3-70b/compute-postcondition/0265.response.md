Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position based on valid moves for piece 2, `parent[2]` contains the parent pointers corresponding to the updated distances for piece 2, `queue` contains all reachable states that have been appended during the iterations based on valid positions. Additionally, the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
