To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the context of the loop and the variables involved.

1. The loop iterates over a set of tuples representing changes in coordinates (`dx`, `dy`). 
2. For the loop to execute, it is important that we have valid tuples available in the list `[(−2,−1),(−2,1),(−1,−2),(−1,2),(1,−2),(1,2),(2,−1),(2,1)]`, which are indeed present.
3. The primary variables of concern are `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `piece`. The loop itself does not directly depend on `N`, `x`, or `y`, but rather on the state of `piece`, `dist`, and `parent`.
4. The current value of `piece` is noted to not equal `1`, which may influence whether the subsequent operations inside the loop body are valid or meaningful.

Given the above analysis, for the loop to execute correctly:

- We must ensure that `piece` is indeed different from `1` to allow for processing inside the loop.
- The state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` should be set in such a way that the loop can perform operations based on their contents.
- The values of `dx` and `dy` will be iterated over, so no specific adjustment is needed for them.

Thus, the state can be defined while ensuring that the loop can execute properly.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` contains its previous valid tuples plus the new tuple (cur, 1), current value of `piece` is not equal to 1, `(dx, dy)` will iterate through valid tuples**
