The code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to the position `parent[2][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` both hold their respective values; `piece` remains 2 as per the initial state. The other variables, including `N`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `parent[2][ncur]`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, 2)`.**
