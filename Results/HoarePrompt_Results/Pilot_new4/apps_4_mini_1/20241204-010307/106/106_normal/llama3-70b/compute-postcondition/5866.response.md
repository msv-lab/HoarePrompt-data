Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` and `y` can be any values. If the `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `piece` is 2 if conditions were met at least once, and `queue` now contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` where conditions were met, along with the initial tuples of the form `(ncur, 1)` and the new tuple `(cur, i)` added to `queue`. If no conditions were met, then `piece` remains 0, and `queue` only contains the initial tuples of the form `(ncur, 0)`. The `dist[2][ncur]` contains the final distances from `cur` for all valid `ncur`, and `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last position and state of `piece` for each valid `ncur`.***
