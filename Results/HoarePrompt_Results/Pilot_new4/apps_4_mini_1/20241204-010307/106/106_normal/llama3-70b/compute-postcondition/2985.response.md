Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
