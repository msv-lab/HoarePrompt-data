The statement `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` has been assigned the value of `A[x - 1][N - 2]`, which is dependent on the values of `x` and `N`. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `parent`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N - 2`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][N - 2]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N - 2`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][N - 2]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
