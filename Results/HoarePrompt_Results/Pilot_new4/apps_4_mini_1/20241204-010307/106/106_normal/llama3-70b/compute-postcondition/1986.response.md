The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, but `dx` and `dy` would typically represent directional changes (e.g., for grid movement). Hence, `nx` will be `x + dx` and `ny` will be `y + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
