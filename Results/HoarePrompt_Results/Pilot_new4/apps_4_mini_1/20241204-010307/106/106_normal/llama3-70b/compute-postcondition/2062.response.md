According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs `(dx, dy)` defined in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Therefore, the loop will execute a total of 4 times, once for each pair of `(dx, dy)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we need to consider how many times the loop has executed and what the current values of `dx` and `dy` are. Since the loop starts at the first pair `(-1, -1)` and will iterate through to `(1, 1)`, after the last iteration, it would have iterated over all four pairs and `dx` and `dy` would now be at the last pair `(1, 1)`.

To execute the loop one more time, we would need to consider the next iteration, which would not occur as there are no more pairs left. Therefore, we must represent the state such that the loop can execute again, and that means resetting to the beginning of the loop pairs.

State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1**
