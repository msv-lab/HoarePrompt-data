The code updates the `dist` array at the position `[0][ncur]` by setting it equal to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The other variables `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The calculation involves taking the current distance at `cur` and adding 1 to it to update the distance at the new position `ncur`.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
