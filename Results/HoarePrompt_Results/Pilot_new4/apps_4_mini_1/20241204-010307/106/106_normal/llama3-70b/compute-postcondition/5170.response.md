The code assigns new values to the variables `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are determined from a tuple in a predefined list.

Since `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, and `y` is between 1 and N-1, we know the following:

- `dx` is assigned the first element of the chosen tuple from the list.
- `dy` is assigned the second element of that tuple.

The values of `nx` and `ny` will be computed as follows:
- `nx = x + dx`
- `ny = y + dy`

The output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while also retaining all other unchanged variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
