Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` may contain tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is equal to 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `4 + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, meaning that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
