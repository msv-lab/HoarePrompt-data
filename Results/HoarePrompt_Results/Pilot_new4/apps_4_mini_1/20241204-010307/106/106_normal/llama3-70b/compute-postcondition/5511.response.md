Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `dist[2]` reflects the minimum distances from the starting point to each valid `ncur` position that can be reached based on the conditions defined in the loop; `parent[2]` contains the corresponding parent positions for each updated `ncur`, indicating the previous position that led to the current distance; `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` pairs that were appended during the loop execution based on valid moves, while any positions that were not reachable remain unchanged. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
