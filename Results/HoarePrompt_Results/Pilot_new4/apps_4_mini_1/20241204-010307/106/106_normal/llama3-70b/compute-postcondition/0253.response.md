The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The initial state mentions that `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, but the exact values of `A`, `dx`, `dy`, and `N` are not specified. The other variables remain unchanged, thus they retain their initial values. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; iteration count is 4; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` has `ncur` and `2` appended.**
