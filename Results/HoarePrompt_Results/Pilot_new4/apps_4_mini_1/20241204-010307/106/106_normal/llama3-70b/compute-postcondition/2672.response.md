According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. This means there are 4 iterations in total, corresponding to each of the direction tuples.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `y` is -1. The loop will execute one more time as long as there are remaining tuples to iterate over. Since the loop will first use the tuple `(-1, -1)` in the first iteration, then `(-1, 1)`, followed by `(1, -1)` and finally `(1, 1)`, we need to track the current iteration state.

Given that `y` is -1 at the end of the previous iteration, this means the loop is currently in the first iteration. Since there are 4 direction tuples, after processing one, we will move on to the next tuple.

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to update the loop variable to reflect which direction tuple will be used next. The next tuple will be `(-1, 1)`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
