The assignment `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny` to `ncur`. The variable `ncur` is defined, and `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, while `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. The conditions ensure that `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` and `N-1`.

After this assignment, the other variables remain unchanged, but `ncur` now holds a specific value from the array `A`. 

The Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
