The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[1][2]`, which is an unknown value. Since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the specific value of `dist[2][cur]` is unknown, but we can express it as `dist[2][cur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[1][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
