Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0]` contains the shortest distances from `(x, y)`; `parent[0]` contains the parent positions; if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `queue` now contains the previous elements plus `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
