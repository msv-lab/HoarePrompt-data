The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are both defined and their previous values are unchanged. The other variables remain as they were. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[nx][ny]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` and `dy` take values from the list of tuples in each iteration, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
