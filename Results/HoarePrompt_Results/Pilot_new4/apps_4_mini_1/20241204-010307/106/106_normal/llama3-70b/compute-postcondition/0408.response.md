The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, along with the variable `piece`. The previous state indicates that `cur` is valid and can be used directly. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, and `dist[1][ncur]` remain unchanged as the code specifically affects `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, piece.**
