Given the initial state where `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0, the code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value of the element in the array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]` to the variable `ncur`. 

The values of `nx` and `ny` are 0 and 1, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will take the value of `A[0][1]`, which depends on the specific content of the array `A`. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Thus, the output state will include the unchanged variables and the assignment of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `ncur` is `A[0][1]`.**
