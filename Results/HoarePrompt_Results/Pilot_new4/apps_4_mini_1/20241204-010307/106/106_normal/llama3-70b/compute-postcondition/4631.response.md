In the provided code, the `queue` is modified by appending a new tuple `(ncur, 2)` to it. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[2][ncur]`, `piece`) are not affected by this specific operation. Therefore, the state of these variables remains the same, except for the `queue`, which will now include the additional tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` includes the previous contents plus the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `piece`.**
