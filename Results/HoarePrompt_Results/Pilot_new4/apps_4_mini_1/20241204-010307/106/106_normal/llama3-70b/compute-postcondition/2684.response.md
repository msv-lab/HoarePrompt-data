The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The initial state indicates that `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, meaning `cur` has a specific value based on `A[x][-1]`. The existing values, such as `dist[1][ncur]`, are already updated, and only the `parent` array is modified. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updates to `parent` while maintaining the relevant information about the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is `A[nx][-2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`.**
