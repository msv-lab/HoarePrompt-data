The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the 2D list `parent` at the position `[0][ncur]`. This does not change the values of `n`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, or `dist`. However, it updates the `parent` array. The specifics of `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state or code snippet, so we will retain their identities.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`; `ny` is equal to `N + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
