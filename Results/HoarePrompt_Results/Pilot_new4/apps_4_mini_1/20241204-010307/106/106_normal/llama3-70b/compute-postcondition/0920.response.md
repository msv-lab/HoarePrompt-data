Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not met, no actions are taken.***
