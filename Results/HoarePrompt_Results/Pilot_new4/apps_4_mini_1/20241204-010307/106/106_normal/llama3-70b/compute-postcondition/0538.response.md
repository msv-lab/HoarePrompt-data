Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 0; and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
