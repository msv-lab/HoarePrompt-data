According to the code, the loop iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing possible moves (dx, dy). Each iteration corresponds to one of the possible moves for a piece on a board. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable (dx, dy) corresponds to the last tuple in the list. The current values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, and `parent` do not directly influence the iteration count of the loop since the loop will execute a fixed number of times based on the length of the list of tuples.

Since the loop has already completed one full pass over the list of tuples, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to start over from the beginning of the list. Therefore, we need to reset the loop variables (dx, dy) back to the first tuple in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1** (the first tuple in the list).
