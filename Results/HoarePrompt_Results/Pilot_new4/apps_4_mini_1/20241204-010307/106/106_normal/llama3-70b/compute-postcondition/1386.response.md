In the provided code, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `nx` has a value of 1 and `ny` has a value of 0, which means `ncur` will now hold the value of `A[1][0]`. The initial state for `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, but this does not affect the assignment of `ncur`. The values of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `dist` is unchanged, `parent` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`.**
