The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from their dependence on other variables. The state of other variables such as `N`, `piece`, and the direction `(dx, dy)` remain unchanged as they are not impacted by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; the next direction will be (dx, dy) for the next iteration.**
