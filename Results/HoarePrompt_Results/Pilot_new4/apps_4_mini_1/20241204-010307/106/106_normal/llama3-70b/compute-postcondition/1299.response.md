The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[2][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this assignment.

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and it is being used as an index, it is important to note that it is being accessed but not altered by the assignment operation. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are assigned to `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
