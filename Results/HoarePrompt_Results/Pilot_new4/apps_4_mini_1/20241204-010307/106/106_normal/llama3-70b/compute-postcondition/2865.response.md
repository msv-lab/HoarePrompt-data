Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is 2, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates predecessors for reachable positions, `dist[1]` holds shortest distances for positions reachable with piece value 1, `parent[1]` indicates predecessors for those positions, `queue` must not be empty, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The current value of `piece` is 2 and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
