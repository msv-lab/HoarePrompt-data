According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples containing the values `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each pair in the list, which contains four tuples. Therefore, there are no constraints on the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `queue`, `dist`, `parent`, or `piece` that would prevent the loop from executing. 

However, it is important to define the initial state of `dx` and `dy` at the start of the loop. Since they will be assigned the values of each tuple in the list sequentially, we can state that `dx` and `dy` will be initialized to the first tuple's values (-1, -1) at the beginning of the loop. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` where valid `ncur` corresponds to positions that satisfy the conditions, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` based on the distance from `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, and `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1**
