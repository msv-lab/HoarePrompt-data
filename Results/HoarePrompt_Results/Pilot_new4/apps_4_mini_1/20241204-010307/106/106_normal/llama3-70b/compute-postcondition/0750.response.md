Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[x + 1][4]`, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If these conditions are not met, no changes occur.***
