Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, all valid `(nx, ny)` pairs have been checked, `ncur` holds the value of `A[nx][ny]` for each valid `(nx, ny)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur` based on the condition `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the predecessor relationships for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` entries that were added during the loop execution. If the loop does not execute, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged, and `queue` remains empty.**
