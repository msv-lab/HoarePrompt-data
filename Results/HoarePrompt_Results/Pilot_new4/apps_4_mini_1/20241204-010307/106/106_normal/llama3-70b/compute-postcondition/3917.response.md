Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, `queue` contains at least one valid position, the newly appended position `(ncur, 2)` is valid, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
