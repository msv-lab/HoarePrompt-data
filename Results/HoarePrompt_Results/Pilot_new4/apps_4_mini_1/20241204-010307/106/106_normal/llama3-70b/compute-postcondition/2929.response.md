The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[1][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The values of `parent` are updated specifically at the index `[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` contains at least one tuple for the processed position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
