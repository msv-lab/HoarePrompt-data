The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`, indicating that the distance from the `piece` (which is equal to 2) to the current position (`cur`) has increased by 1 for the new position (`ncur`). The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `dist[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for all valid moves, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N-1`; `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and is greater than its previous value.**
