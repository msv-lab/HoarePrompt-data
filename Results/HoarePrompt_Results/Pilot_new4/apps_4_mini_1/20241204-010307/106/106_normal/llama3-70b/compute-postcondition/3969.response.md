The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. Given the initial state, we have `ncur` equal to `A[-2][-1]`, which is determined by the values in the array `A`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the main change is that the `queue` now has an additional tuple in it.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
