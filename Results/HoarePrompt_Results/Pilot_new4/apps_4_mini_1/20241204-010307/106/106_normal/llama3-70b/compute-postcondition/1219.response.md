In this case, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `2` and `1`, respectively. Since `A` is not defined in the initial state, the specific value of `ncur` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of the array `A`. The variable states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged because the assignment does not affect them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`.**
