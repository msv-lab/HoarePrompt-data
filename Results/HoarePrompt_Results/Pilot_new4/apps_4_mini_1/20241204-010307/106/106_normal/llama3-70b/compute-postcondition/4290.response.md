Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, and `queue` now contains all previous tuples plus the tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is 2 and not equal to `i`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, the states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
