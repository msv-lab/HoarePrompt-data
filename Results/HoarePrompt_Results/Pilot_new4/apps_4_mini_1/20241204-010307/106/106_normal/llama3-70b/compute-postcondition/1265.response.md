Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is the same as before, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions based on conditions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken for those updated positions, `queue` now contains tuples of all updated positions that met the conditions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece), and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
