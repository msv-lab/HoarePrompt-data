Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains a list of tuples `(ncur, 2)` for each reachable `ncur` from `(0, 0)` where `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` has been updated accordingly. For each `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance from `cur` with the incremented values, and `parent[2][ncur]` indicates the respective predecessors as tuples of `(cur, piece)`. If the loop does not execute, `dist` and `parent` for index 2 remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
