The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Since `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will remain equal to `y`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains the previous values of the variables, but updates `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, and `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`.**
