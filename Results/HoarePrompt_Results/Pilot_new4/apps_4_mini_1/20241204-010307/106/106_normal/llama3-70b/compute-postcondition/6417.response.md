The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue` list. The variable `ncur` has a specific value defined as `A[-1][-1]`, which represents an element from a 2D list or array `A`. The value of `queue` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is assumed that it exists as a list that can accept new elements.

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[-1][-1]`, the output state will reflect that `queue` now includes this new element. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]; queue` now includes the element `(ncur, 0)`.**
