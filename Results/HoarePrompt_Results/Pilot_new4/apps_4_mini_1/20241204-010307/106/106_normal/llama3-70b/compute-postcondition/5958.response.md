The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `9 + dy`, respectively, and both fall within the range of `0` to `N` (inclusive of `0` and exclusive of `N`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the current first element of the tuple, `dy` is the current second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the current first element of the tuple, `dy` is the current second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]**.
