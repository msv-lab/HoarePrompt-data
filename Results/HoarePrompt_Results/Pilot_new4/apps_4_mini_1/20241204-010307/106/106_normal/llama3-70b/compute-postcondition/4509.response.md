The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][0]`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist[1][ncur]` are not changed. It is important to note that `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 1][1]`, which implies that `parent[1][ncur]` is being updated based on the current position of a piece in a knight's move scenario. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change in the `parent` array while keeping the rest of the variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples and potentially now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
