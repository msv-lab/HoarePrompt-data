According to the code, the loop will iterate over the list of tuples `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which contains 4 elements. The loop variable `(dx, dy)` will take on each of these tuples in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `piece` is 1

Since the loop will execute 4 times (once for each tuple), after the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` would have been set to the last tuple `(0, 1)`. 

To prepare for the next iteration, the loop will reset to the first tuple in its iterations. After the last iteration, the next execution will attempt to set `dx` and `dy` to `(-1, 0)`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we can state:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
