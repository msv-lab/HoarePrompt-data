Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all reachable cells and their corresponding pieces that were added during the loop iterations, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` ensure that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
