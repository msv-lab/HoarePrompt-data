The line of code assigns the value of `cur` to the array `parent[2]` at the position `ncur`, which is a valid position in the two-dimensional array `A`. The previous state allows us to deduce that `cur` is an index that has a defined value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, except for `parent[2][ncur]`, which is now assigned the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][N + 1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
