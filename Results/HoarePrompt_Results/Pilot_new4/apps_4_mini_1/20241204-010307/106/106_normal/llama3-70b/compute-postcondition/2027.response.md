According to the code, the loop iterates through the tuples in the list of `(dx, dy)` coordinates, which are used to explore neighboring positions. The loop will execute for each of the 8 tuples. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` would correspond to the last tuple in the list, which is (2, 1), meaning that the next iteration of the loop will take the next tuple in the list, which would be the first tuple again, due to the loop structure. 

Since there are no additional tuples beyond the 8 specified, the next state of `dx` and `dy` would reset to the first tuple in the list, which is (-2, -1). The iteration will continue for each of the tuples until they have all been used.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `dx` will be updated to -2
- `dy` will be updated to -1

The other states remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances, where `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents with `parent[0][ncur]` equal to `cur`; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains (cur, i) and (ncur, 0); `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
