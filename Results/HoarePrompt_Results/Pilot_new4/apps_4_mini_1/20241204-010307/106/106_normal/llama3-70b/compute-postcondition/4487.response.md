The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving the existing values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The new values are calculated as follows:

- `nx` is assigned `x + dx`, which means it takes the current value of `x` and adds `dx` (which is -1) to it.
- `ny` is assigned `y + dy`, which means it takes the current value of `y` (which is 0) and adds `dy` (which is -2) to it.

Given that:
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -2
- `y` is 0

The updated values will be:
- `nx` becomes `x - 1`
- `ny` becomes `0 - 2`, which equals -2.

Thus, the output state reflects these changes while maintaining the information about the other variables that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is -2.**
