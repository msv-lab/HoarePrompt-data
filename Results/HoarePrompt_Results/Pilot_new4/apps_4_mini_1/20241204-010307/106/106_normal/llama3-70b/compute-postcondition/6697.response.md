The variable `queue` is being modified by appending a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer `1`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are preserved, and since `ncur` is derived from an earlier assignment, its value will remain consistent with that context. The precondition regarding the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
