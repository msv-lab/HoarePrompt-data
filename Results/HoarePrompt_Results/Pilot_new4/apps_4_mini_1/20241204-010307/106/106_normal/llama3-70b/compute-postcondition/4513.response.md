According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the possible moves of a knight, which are defined by the changes in the x and y coordinates. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `x` is some integer dependent on the current state, and `y` is 0. The loop iterates over the list containing 4 moves, and since this is a "for" loop, it will increment the index automatically for each iteration.

After the last iteration, the index for the loop has moved to the next tuple in the list, which means that if the loop is to execute again, it must go through all 4 tuples. Given that `dx` and `dy` will take each of the values from the list one at a time, if it has executed one iteration, it will now take the second tuple or the next one, depending on how many times it has executed.

Since the list has 4 elements, after the last iteration, we need the loop state to reflect the next tuple. As we have not yet done any iterations, the loop hasn't been executed yet. After the first execution, it will be set to the case of the first element of the tuple.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `dx` and `dy` are the second tuple in the list of possible moves.**
