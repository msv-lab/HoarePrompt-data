Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dist[2]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell for piece 2; `parent[2]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell for piece 2; if the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`; if `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
