According to the code, the for loop will execute a fixed number of times based on the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]` provided in the loop header. There are 8 pairs of values, meaning the loop will execute 8 iterations regardless of the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, or `A`. 

Since these values do not affect the loop's ability to execute, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run. However, since the loop body may depend on `x`, `y`, or the values in the array `A`, we should ensure that their initial values are noted. 

To clarify, at the start of the loop:
- `dx` will take on each of the first elements of the pairs in the list.
- `dy` will take on each of the second elements of the pairs in the list.

Thus, we can state that for the loop to run, `dx` will begin as -2 and `dy` will begin as -1, reflecting the first iteration. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
