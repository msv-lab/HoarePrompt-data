The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, meaning it will depend on the values at the specific indices `nx` and `ny` in the array `A`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are not changed by this operation, and their definitions still hold true (`nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`). The other variables (`N`, `piece`) remain unchanged as well.

Since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, and `piece` is still 2, we preserve that information in the output state. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
