The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. However, since `nx` is -2, which is out of range (as it must be between 0 and N), accessing `A[nx][ny]` would typically result in an error or an undefined behavior in Python if `A` is a list or array. Therefore, we cannot determine a valid value for `ncur` based on the current state since `nx` is not within the valid range.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is undefined due to invalid index access.**
