The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged as there are no further operations affecting them. 

Since `ncur` has been updated with a value from `A[nx][ny]`, the state of `queue` is updated by adding a new tuple while keeping all the other precondition states intact.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` now contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` has been appended to `queue`.**
