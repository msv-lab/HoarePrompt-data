Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[2][ncur]` represents all previous positions leading to each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(cur, i)` if the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the condition is not met, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
