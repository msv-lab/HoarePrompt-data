Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, and `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the conditions are not met, there are no changes to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
