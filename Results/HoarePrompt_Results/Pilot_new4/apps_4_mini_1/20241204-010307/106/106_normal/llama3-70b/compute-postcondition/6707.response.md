Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the conditions are not met, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
