To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state.

Initially, we have the following information:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is `2`
- `nx` is `x + 1`
- `ny` is `3`
- There are no more pairs in the loop.

Now, let's analyze the code snippet:
```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

From the initial conditions:
- `ny` is already `3`, and it will be updated with the expression `y + dy`. Since `y` is `2`, the `ny` will equal `2 + dy`.
- `nx` is updated with the expression `x + dx`.

However, we do not have explicit values for `x`, `dx`, or `dy`. Therefore, we can only express the changes in terms of these variables.

After executing the code:
- `nx` becomes `x + dx`
- `ny` becomes `2 + dy` 

The other variables' states remain unchanged. 

Now we summarize the valid information:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is `2`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`**.
