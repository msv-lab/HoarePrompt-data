The line of code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[2][ncur]`. The initial state does not specify the values of `cur` and `piece`, but `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[-2][0]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned values `cur` and `piece`.**
