The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, and no specific values for `cur`, `piece`, or `ncur` are provided, they will not affect the output. The relevant updated variable is `parent[0][ncur]`, which is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
