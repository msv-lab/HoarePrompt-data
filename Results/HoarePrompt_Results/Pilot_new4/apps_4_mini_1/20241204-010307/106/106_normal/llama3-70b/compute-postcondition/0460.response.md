The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are affected by this operation, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, it has a specific value based on that, and `0` is a constant. Thus, the state of the `queue` will now include this new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `3`, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `loop index` is 8 (which is out of bounds), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
