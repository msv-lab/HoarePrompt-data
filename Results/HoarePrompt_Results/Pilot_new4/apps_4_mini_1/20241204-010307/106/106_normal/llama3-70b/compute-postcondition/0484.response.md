The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are already defined, with `nx` being equal to `x - 1` and `ny` being equal to `1`. The variable `N` is within the range of 3 to 10, and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, which implies that `nx` will be `x - 1`, thus `0 <= nx < N - 1`. 

The states of the other variables, including `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `x`, remain unaffected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`.**
