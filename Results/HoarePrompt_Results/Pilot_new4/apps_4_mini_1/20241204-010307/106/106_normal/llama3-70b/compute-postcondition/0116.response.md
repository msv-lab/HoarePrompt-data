According to the provided code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional changes `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. Since the loop has 8 directions, it will iterate for each `(dx, dy)` pair.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `piece` equals 0, which is a condition to check before updating the `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`. The variables `nx` and `ny` must also be within the specified bounds (0 to N exclusive). 

Since the loop iterates through 8 pairs, and no specific iteration state is given (like which `(dx, dy)` pair has been processed last), I can assume that the loop is at the beginning of the next iteration. The next values of `(dx, dy)` need to be referenced.

Assuming the loop has processed one `(dx, dy)` pair so far, for the loop to execute again, the first iteration would be over, and the next tuple would be processed.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, and `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), and `piece` equals 0, with one of the pairs `(dx, dy)` needing to be processed next.**
