The code assigns `nx` and `ny` the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial values for `x` and `y` are `0` and `1`. The variables `dx` and `dy` are not explicitly defined in the initial state but are meant to represent the changes in the x and y coordinates respectively. Thus, `nx` will be `0 + dx` and `ny` will be `1 + dy`. 

Since `dx` and `dy` can take various values based on the loop that executes for all valid tuples, the exact values for `nx` and `ny` will depend on those specific values of `dx` and `dy`.

Other variables such as `N`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0]` contains the shortest distances from `(x, y)`; `parent[0]` contains the parent positions; `queue` contains potential positions to explore.**
