Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 0, 1, or 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
