The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`. The specific values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are utilized in this assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

The previous values of `ncur` has been previously defined as `A[nx][ny]`, while `piece` is equal to `1`. Since `cur` is also referenced in the assignment, its value remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is updated to reflect the assignment made to `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is either 0 or 2, `ny` is either 0 or 2 depending on the values taken from `dx` and `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
