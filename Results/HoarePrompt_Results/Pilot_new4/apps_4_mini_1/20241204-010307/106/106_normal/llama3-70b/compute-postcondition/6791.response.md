In the provided code snippet, there is an operation to append a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `1` are used as they are; no changes occur to any of the other variables. The initial values and state of the other variables remain valid.

The output state reflects that `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, but the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
