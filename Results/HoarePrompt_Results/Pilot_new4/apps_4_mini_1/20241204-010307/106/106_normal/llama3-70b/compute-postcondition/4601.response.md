The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `x - 1` and `0`, respectively. Since the specific value of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `nx`, but we know that `ny` is `0`. Therefore, `ncur` will be `A[nx][0]` where `nx` is `x - 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that `ncur` is now equal to `A[nx][0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`.**
