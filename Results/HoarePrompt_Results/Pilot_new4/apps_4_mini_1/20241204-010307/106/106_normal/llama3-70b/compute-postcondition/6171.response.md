The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are unknown, so we cannot specify them. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
