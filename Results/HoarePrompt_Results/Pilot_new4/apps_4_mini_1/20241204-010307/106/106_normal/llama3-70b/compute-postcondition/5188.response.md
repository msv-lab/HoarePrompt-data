`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are known, with `dx` being -2 and `dy` being 1. Therefore, `nx` will always be `x - 2` and `ny` will be `y + 1`. The constraints on `x` (which is between 0 and N-1) and `y` (which is between 1 and N-1) ensure that after the modifications, `nx` could potentially be negative if `x` is 0, but `ny` will always remain within the bounds depending on the value of `y`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is `y + 1`.**
