Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable nodes that correspond to the `dx` and `dy` movements, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, and the distance from node 1 to `ncur` is greater than the distance from node 1 to `cur` plus 1.***
