Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions for reachable states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from the valid moves, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` and `ny` are valid indices within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`. The value of `piece` is 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
