According to the code, the loop will iterate over the tuples in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, which means it will execute 4 times in total, once for each pair `(dx, dy)`. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will have taken on the values of the last tuple, which is `(1, 1)`.

Since the loop is structured to iterate over a fixed list of tuples, the state will need to reset to the first tuple in the list for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `dx` and `dy` must be set to the first tuple `(-1, -1)`.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 1 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + (-1)`; `ny` is equal to `y + (-1)`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1**
