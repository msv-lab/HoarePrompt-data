The operation `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The other variables in the state remain unchanged, and their previous values still hold. 

The variable `ncur` is defined as equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but since we do not have the specific structure of `A`, we still maintain that definition. The value `2` is a constant and does not change.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the operation performed on `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
