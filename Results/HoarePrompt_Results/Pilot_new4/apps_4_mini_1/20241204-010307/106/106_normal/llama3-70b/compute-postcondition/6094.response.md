The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` remain unchanged, but the `queue` variable will now have an additional element. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `queue`, we will indicate that it has been updated with the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
