Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances, where `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents with `parent[0][ncur]` equal to `cur`; `piece` remains unchanged at 2, except when it was 0, in which case it is updated to 0; `queue` contains (cur, i) and (ncur, 0); `dx` and `dy` iterate through the 8 tuples in the list; `nx` is updated to `x + dx` and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then all the conditions hold as stated.***
