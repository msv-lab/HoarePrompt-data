Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2 (if updates occurred), `dist[2]` is updated based on the shortest distances from the starting position, `parent[2]` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position as per the updates, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations. If no updates occurred during the loop, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
