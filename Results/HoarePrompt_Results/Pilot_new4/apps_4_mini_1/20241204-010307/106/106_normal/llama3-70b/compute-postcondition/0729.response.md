In the provided code snippet, `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are pushed into the `queue`, but no other variables are modified or affected in this operation. 

The valid preconditions that remain after executing the code are:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `nx` is `x + dx`
- `ny` is `2 + dy`
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`
- `piece`
- `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
