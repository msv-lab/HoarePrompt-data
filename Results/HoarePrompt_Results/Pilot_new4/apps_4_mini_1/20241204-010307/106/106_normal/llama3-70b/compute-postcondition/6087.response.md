Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, and `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`. If the conditions for the if statement are not met, the `queue` remains unchanged and no updates are made to `dist` or `parent`.***
