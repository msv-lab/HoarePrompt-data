The line of code updates a 2D array `dist` at the position `[0][ncur]`, setting it equal to the value at `[0][cur]` plus 1. The variable `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` and `ny` are defined based on `dx` and `dy`.

Since we are not given specific values for `dx`, `dy`, or the contents of the array `A`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`. However, we know the following:

- `N` is between 3 and 10 (inclusive).
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 0.
- `index` is 0.
- `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`.
- `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Assuming `cur` has some value that is not specified, `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated based on whatever value `dist[0][cur]` had plus 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updates:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `index` is 0, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
