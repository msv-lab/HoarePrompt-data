The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The initial values of `x` and `y` are both 0, so if `dx` and `dy` are defined, then `nx = 0 + dx` and `ny = 0 + dy`. Furthermore, the conditions for `ncur` and the values of `nx` and `ny` depend on whether `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true, but this condition does not affect the assignment of `nx` and `ny`.

The output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while all other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `nx` is updated to `0 + dx`, `ny` is updated to `0 + dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is defined.**
