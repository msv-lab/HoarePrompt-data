Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 0. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there is no change. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes occur.***
