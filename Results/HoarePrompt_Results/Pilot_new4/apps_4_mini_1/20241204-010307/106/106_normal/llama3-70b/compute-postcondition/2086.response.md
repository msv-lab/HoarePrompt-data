The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. Since the initial states of the variables `ncur` and `piece` are given, we can directly assign their values to the tuple being appended. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]` and `piece` is equal to 2, the output state reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(A[x][y + 1], 2)`.**
