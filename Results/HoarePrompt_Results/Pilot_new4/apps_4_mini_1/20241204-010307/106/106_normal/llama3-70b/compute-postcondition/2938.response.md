Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` and also includes `queue.append((ncur, 1))`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 1][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
