According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples of `(dx, dy)`. Since these tuples are fixed and there are 8 iterations in total, the loop will continue to execute as long as we haven't reached the end of the list of tuples.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, and `cur` is defined. The state of `dist` and `parent` might have changed depending on the conditions checked during the loop body, but the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

The loop will execute one more time for the next tuple in the list. The index of the current tuple can be tracked, and since there are 8 tuples, if the loop just completed the 7th iteration, the loop will proceed to the 8th iteration.

The specific `dx` and `dy` values will be taken from that next tuple: `(2, 1)` at the last iteration. 

To summarize, we know that `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` remains 0, `y` remains 0, `cur` remains defined, `nx` and `ny` will take the values from the next tuple `(2, 1)`, and therefore `ncur` will change accordingly based on `A[nx][ny]`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to 2, `ny` is equal to 1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is defined, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`**.
