The line of code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value at the first dimension of the `dist` array. Specifically, it assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` remain unchanged, while the `dist` array's first dimension at index `ncur` is updated based on the value at index `cur`. 

Since the distance from the start to `ncur` is now one more than the distance from the start to `cur`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the current first element of the tuple, `dy` is the current second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, the distance from the start to `ncur` is equal to the distance from the start to `cur` plus 1, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
