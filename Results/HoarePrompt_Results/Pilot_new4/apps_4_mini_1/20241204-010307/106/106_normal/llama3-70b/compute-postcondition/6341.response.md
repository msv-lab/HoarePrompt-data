The line `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. In this context, `cur` is the value of `A[0][0]`, and `piece` is assigned the value `1`. Hence, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to a tuple containing `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable nodes that correspond to the `dx` and `dy` movements, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
