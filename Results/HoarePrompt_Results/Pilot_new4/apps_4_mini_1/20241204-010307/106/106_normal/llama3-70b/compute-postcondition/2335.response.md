The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the matrix `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. Since `nx` and `ny` are both within the range [0, N), this means that `ncur` will take on a value from the matrix `A` located at valid indices. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` contains at least 1 reachable position, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
