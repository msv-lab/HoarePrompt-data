According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the possible changes in coordinates (dx, dy). For the next iteration of the loop, `dx` and `dy` will take on the next tuple in the list. 

The current state indicates:
- `N` is between 3 and 10, meaning the valid index range for both `nx` and `ny` is from 0 to N-1.
- The loop will iterate over the tuples. In the current iteration, it is unspecified which tuple is currently being processed, but there are a total of 8 tuples in the list.

Since only `dx` and `dy` are adjusted in each iteration and there are no other conditions affecting them, the next tuple will be processed in the next iteration. 

After processing the last tuple `(2, 1)`, `dx` and `dy` will have already cycled through all 8 pairs, so for the loop to run an additional time, they will wrap around to the first tuple `(-2, -1)`.

Hence, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `dx` will be set to -2.
- `dy` will be set to -1.

There are no other changes required for the state variables given since other values remain unaffected by the loop iteration itself.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
