Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A` is a 2D array where `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1 + dx][dy]`, and the current values satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The value of `piece` is 0 and the distance from the first index of `dist` to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the first index of `dist` to `cur` plus 1.***
