The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the preconditions, specifically `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
