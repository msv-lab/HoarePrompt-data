Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)` if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, with `parent[1][ncur]` set to `cur`.***
