The line of code updates the `dist[1][ncur]` variable. The value it gets assigned is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The variables `ncur` and `cur` are both involved in this operation. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-1]`, but the value of `cur` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. 

The other variables remain unchanged and retain their original conditions. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the relationship established by the assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-1]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
