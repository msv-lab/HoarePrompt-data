The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]`, along with the value of `piece`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The variable `parent[2][ncur]` will now hold the value of `cur`, while the values of `dist`, `queue`, `N`, `current direction`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions; current direction is (1, 0); `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
