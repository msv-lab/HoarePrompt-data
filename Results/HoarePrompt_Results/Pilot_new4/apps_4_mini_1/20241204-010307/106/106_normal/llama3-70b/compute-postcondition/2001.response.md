Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` remains 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)` if the condition `piece == 2 and dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` is true. If the condition is false, then no changes are made to the variables.***
