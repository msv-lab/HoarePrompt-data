Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, and since `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be one more than `dist[2][cur]`, with `parent[2][ncur]` assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`.***
