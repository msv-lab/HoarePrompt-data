The assignment `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[1][ncur]`. 

Given that `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this means `dist[1][cur] + 1` is now assigned to `dist[1][ncur]`, making `dist[1][ncur]` less than or equal to the previously stored value.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as they are not impacted by the operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updates to the relevant variables while maintaining the constraints and conditions of the others.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
