According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable in the for loop, which in this case is a list of tuples representing the pairs `(-2, -1)`, `(-2, 1)`, `(-1, -2)`, `(-1, 2)`, `(1, -2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, -1)`, and `(2, 1)`. This list is static and does not depend on the state of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. 

Since the loop will execute regardless of other variables and will iterate over the 8 given pairs, no variables need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. 

The only relevant states before the loop execution are that `N` is in the range of 3 to 10 and that `y` is equal to `N`, while the states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the adjustments needed are minimal and merely confirm the existing states.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged**
