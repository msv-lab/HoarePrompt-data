Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and `queue` includes previous valid tuples plus the new tuple (ncur, 0). The current value of `piece` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
