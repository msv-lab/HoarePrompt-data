The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the values from the tuple `dx` and `dy`. Given that `dx` and `dy` are set to the first tuple (-2, -1), we can determine the impact of the code.

The new values will be:
- `nx = x + dx` which translates to `nx = x - 2`
- `ny = y + dy` which translates to `ny = y - 1`

The variable `y` is initially 1, thus `ny` will be calculated as `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`. The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, but it can take any integer value within the constraints.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0.**
