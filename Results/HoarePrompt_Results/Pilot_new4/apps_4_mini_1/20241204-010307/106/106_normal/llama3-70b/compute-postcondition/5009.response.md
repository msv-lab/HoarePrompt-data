The value of `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and `nx` is 1 and `ny` is -1. Therefore, `ncur` will take the value from the 1st row and -1st column of the array `A`. However, since `ny` is negative, it may lead to an index error depending on how `A` is defined, but we will assume it is a valid operation for the sake of this task.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is -1; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions; `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` contains all valid tuples; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[1][-1]`.**
