Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, with `dist[2][ncur]` now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices; `piece` is 2; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is now `cur, piece`.**
