The line of code `parent[0][ncur] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the `parent` array at the specified indices. The variable `ncur` is already associated with the value `A[-2][-1]`, but the specific value of `cur` was not provided in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
