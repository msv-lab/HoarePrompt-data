In the given code, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are fixed, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the exact values of `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined without knowing `dx` and `dy`.

However, we know that:
- `N` is an integer between 3 and 10,
- `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`,
- `piece` is 1,
- `dist` contains updates based on valid `ncur` values,
- `parent` reflects the last valid `cur` and `piece` for those updates,
- `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for all valid updates,
- The loop will execute four times with fixed `(dx, dy)` values.

Thus, `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `x` and `y` plus the fixed changes `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` is updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
