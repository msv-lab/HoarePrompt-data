The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the expression `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` and `ny` are calculated from the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

The output state will reflect that `parent[0][ncur]` now holds a tuple containing the current values of `cur` and `piece`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is A[nx][ny]; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
