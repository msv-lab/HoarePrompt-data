The code assigns values to `parent[0][ncur]`. The specific value of `ncur` is based on the earlier calculation, which is `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `cur` is also referenced in the assignment but its value is not provided in the initial state. Consequently, the output state reflects the assignment of `parent[0][ncur]` with both `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`.**
