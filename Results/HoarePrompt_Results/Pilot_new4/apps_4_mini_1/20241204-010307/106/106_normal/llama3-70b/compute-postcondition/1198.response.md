Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances for reachable `ncur` positions from `(x, y)` considering the piece type; `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for all reachable `ncur` positions updated during the loop iterations, or remains unchanged if no conditions for updating were met.**
