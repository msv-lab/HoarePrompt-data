The operation `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the position `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `parent` is modified at the specified index. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

The relevant conditions are:
- `dist` still contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions.
- `parent` has been updated at index `[2][ncur]` to hold the tuple `(cur, piece)`.
- `queue` still contains at least one valid tuple.
- `nx` and `ny` remain equal to `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively.
- `ncur` remains equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
- The current values of `nx` and `ny` are still within the bounds of 0 and N, inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N.
- `piece` is still equal to 2.
- `dist[2][ncur]` is still equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent[2][ncur]` is now (cur, piece), `queue` contains at least one valid tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, current values of `nx` and `ny` are within bounds of 0 and N, inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
