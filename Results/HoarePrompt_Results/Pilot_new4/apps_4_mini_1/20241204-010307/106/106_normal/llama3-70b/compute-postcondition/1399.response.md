Postcondition: ***Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, and `dy` is 1, if the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied, then `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the pair `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, if the conditions are not met, no changes are made to the state.***
