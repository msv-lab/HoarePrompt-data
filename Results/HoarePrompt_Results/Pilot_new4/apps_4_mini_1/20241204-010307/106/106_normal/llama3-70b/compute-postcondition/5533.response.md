The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. 

Given that `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is -1, we can compute the new values:
- `nx = 0 + (-2) = -2`
- `ny = 0 + (-1) = -1`

The other variables (`N`, `queue`, `A[0][0]`, `cur`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.**
