According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]` which represent the possible movements in the grid. Each iteration modifies the states according to the current values of `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `N` is between 3 and 10, which means it is still within the required bounds for the loop to execute.
- Variables `x` and `y` represent the current position in a grid or matrix.
- The tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, `(0, 1)` represent movements: up, down, left, and right respectively.

The loop will be executed four times in total. If we are at the end of the last iteration (the fourth iteration) which corresponds to moving right `(0, 1)`, the next state would correspond to moving up `(-1, 0)` again. 

Thus, if we have completed the fourth iteration with the last values of `dx` and `dy` as `(0, 1)`, the next values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the first tuple in the list, which is `(-1, 0)`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0**
