Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2]` is updated based on the shortest distances from the starting position, `parent[2]` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position as per the updates, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations. If no updates occurred during the loop, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.***
