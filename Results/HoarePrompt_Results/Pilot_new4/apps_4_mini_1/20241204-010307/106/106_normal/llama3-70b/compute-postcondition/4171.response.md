Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on the conditions checked during the loop iterations, `parent[1][ncur]` contains references to nodes reachable from (0, 2) depending on `dist[1][cur]`, `queue` contains tuples of positions and piece states that were added during the loop execution. If none of the conditions are satisfied for any iteration, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains empty.**
