The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[2][ncur]`, establishing a relationship between the current node `ncur` and its parent `cur` with an additional piece identifier. The previous values of `parent[1][ncur]`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates parents for each `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `current value of dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
