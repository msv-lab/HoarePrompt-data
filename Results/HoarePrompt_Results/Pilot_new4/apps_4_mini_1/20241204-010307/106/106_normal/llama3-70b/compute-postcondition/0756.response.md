The variable `queue` is updated by appending a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` to it. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added to the queue, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`, `queue` has a new element `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
