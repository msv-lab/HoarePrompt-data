To evaluate the code, we need to analyze the assignment of `nx` and `ny` based on the provided state.

The initial state includes:
- `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10
- `y` is 2
- `piece` is 0
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is -1
- `ny` is 3
- `nx` is equal to `x + 2` (but the value of `x` is not provided)

Now, let's look at the assignment:
```python
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

From the code, we see that:
- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `x - 2` (since `dx` is -2).
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `2 - 1 = 1` (since `y` is 2 and `dy` is -1).

Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `nx`. However, we can note that `nx` will be `x - 2`.

Updating the values of the variables that have changed:
- `ny` is now 1.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ny` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`.**
