Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, where `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, and `ny` is `dy`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `piece`, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not satisfied, no actions are taken.***
