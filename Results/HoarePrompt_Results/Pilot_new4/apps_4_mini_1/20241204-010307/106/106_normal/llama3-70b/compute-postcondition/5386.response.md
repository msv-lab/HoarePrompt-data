The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be a valid state since it is used to update the `dist` and `parent` arrays.

Other variables remain unchanged, but we can affirm that `queue` will have a new entry after this operation. Since `N` is between 4 and 10, we do not change `N`, and all other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `piece` is 1; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 5; `ny` is 2; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
