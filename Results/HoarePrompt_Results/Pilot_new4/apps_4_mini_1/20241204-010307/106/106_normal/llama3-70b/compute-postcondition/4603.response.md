The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to an element of the `parent` array. The other variables remain unchanged in this context.

The initial conditions include:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is 0
- `piece` is 1
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -1
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`
- `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`

The assignment modifies `parent[1][ncur]`, but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
