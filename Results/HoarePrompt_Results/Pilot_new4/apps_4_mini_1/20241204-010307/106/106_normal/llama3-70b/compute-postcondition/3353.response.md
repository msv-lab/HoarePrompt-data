The code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. The previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` is not given, but it will now be equal to the value of `dist[0][cur]` plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and `dist[0][ncur]` is modified based on the value of `dist[0][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
