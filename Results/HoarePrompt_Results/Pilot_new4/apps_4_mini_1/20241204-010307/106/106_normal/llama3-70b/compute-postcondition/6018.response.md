Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, and if `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and the piece is equal to 2 with `dist[2][ncur]` greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`.***
