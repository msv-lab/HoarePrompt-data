The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are used directly in this operation. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` retain their previous conditions, except for the addition of the new element in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
