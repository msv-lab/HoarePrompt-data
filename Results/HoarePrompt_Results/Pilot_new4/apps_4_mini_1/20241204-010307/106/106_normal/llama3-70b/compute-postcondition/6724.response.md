The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation, and the conditions provided in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of the variables along with the queue being updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents.**
