The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. From the initial state, `nx` is 0 and `ny` is 2. Therefore, `ncur` will take the value of the element at the first row and third column of the array `A`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1**.
