The statement updates the `dist` array at the index `[2][ncur]` with the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The value of `cur` is not mentioned in the initial state, but `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`. Therefore, `ncur` is determined based on the values of `A`, `nx`, and `ny`. 

The state of the other variables remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
