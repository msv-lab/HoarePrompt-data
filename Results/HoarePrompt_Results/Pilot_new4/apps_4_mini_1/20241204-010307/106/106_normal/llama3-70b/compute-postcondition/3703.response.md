To analyze the provided code snippet, we start by identifying how the state of the variables changes:

1. The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified, so `ncur` will depend on these values.

2. The line of code executed is `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1`. This means that the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[0][cur]`, incremented by 1. However, the specific value of `cur` is not mentioned.

Given the above points, we summarize the changes:
- `ncur` is updated to `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`.
- `dist[0][ncur]` will be `dist[0][cur] + 1`, but we do not know the specific values for `dist` and `cur`.

We retain all other variables in the output state unchanged.

Based on this reasoning, the output state can be articulated as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the next pair of (dx, dy), `ncur` is equal to `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
