The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The given values for `dx` and `dy` are `(1, 0)`. Therefore, `nx` becomes `x + 1` and `ny` becomes `y + 0` (which is simply `y`). The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `piece`, and `dx`, `dy` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the output state is updated to reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `0`; `piece` remains equal to 2; the next (dx, dy) is `(1, 0)`**
