The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, which means that the previous value of `parent[0][ncur]` will now be replaced by `cur`. Other variables involved in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
