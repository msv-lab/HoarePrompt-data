In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x` and `y` combined with the respective values from the lists `dx` and `dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state provided, we cannot determine their values. However, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged, as the operation only assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated information on `nx` and `ny` without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 0, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, and `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` must allow for movements from position (2, 0) within the bounds of array `A`.**
