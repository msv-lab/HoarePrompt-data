Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `piece` is 2. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2]` reflects the updated shortest path distances for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(x, y)`, `parent[2]` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, and `queue` includes all reachable tuples `(ncur, 2)` along with the additional tuple `(cur, i)`.***
