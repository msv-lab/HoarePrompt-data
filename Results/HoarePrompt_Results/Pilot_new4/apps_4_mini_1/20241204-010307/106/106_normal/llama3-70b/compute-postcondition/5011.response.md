The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` are not directly affected by this assignment, so they remain the same. The output state reflects the new assignment in the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is -1; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
