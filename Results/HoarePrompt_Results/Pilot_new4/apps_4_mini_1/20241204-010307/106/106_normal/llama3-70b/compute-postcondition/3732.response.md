The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer `1` to the `queue`. The initial state does not specify the current value of `ncur` or the previous state of `queue`. Thus, the output state will include this action without changing the existing values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `nx`, and `ny`. 

Since `ncur` is referenced but not defined in the initial state, we will retain it as is in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1 (invalid), and `queue` has a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended.**
