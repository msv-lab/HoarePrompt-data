The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The previous values indicate that `nx` is -2 and `ny` is 0. This means `ncur` will be assigned the value located at the indices `-2` and `0` of the array `A`. The other variables retain their values, and the state of `N` being between 3 and 10 is still valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is `dx`, `y` is `dy`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is A[-2][0]**
