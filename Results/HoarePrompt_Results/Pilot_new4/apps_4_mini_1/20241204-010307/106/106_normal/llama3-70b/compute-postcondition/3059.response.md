The code appends a tuple containing the variable `ncur` and the constant `2` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are now included in `queue`, but no other variables have been modified.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
