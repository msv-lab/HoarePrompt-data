The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them. The important change is the addition of the tuple to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`.**
