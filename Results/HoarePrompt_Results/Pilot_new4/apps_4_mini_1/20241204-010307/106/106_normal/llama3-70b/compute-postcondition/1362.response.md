The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this operation, but we can note that `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, and `1` is a constant value being added to the queue. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`**
