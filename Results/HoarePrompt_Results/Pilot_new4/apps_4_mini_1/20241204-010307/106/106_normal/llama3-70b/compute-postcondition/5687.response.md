Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 0`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, no actions are performed.***
