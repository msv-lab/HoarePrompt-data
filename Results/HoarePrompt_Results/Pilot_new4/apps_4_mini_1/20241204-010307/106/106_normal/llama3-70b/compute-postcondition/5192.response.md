The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are now added as a pair to this collection. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[x - 2][y + 1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
