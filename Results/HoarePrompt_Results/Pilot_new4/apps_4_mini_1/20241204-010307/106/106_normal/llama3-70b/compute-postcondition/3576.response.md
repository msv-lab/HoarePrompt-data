The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the end of the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are unchanged; however, it modifies the state of the `queue` by appending a new element to it. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the element `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
