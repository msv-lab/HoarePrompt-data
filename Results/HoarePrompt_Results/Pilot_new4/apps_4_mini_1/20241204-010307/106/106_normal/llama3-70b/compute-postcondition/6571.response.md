Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` arrays are initialized, `parent` arrays are initialized, `queue` contains valid moves processed during the loop, the current value of `A[1][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` set for 8 iterations; `nx` is `1 + dx[i]`, `ny` is `0 + dy[i]` for each iteration `i`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the array, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
