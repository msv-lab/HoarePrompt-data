The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is `A[-1][1]`, but we do not have information on `A` or its contents. Therefore, `ncur` remains unspecified. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `queue` has `ncur` and `1` appended to it.**
