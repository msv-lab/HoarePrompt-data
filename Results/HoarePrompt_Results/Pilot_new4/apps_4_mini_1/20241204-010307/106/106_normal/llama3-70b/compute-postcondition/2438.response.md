According to the code, the loop iterates over the directions represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. Each iteration will take a different tuple `(dx, dy)` from this list. At the end of the last iteration, `dy` is 0, which means the last tuple that was used is either `(-1, 0)` or `(1, 0)`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next tuple in the sequence.

The tuples are in the order:
1. `(-1, 0)` 
2. `(1, 0)` 
3. `(0, -1)` 
4. `(0, 1)`

If the last iteration used the tuple `(1, 0)`, the next tuple will be `(0, -1)`. If it used `(-1, 0)`, the next will be `(0, -1)` as well. Therefore, `dx` will be `0` and `dy` will be `-1` for the next iteration.

In summary, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` will be `0` and `dy` will be `-1`. The other states will remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + 0`; `ny` is `-1`; `piece` remains equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on conditions; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`; `queue` has appended the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**
