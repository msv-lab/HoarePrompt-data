The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are known, where `nx` is equal to `x + 1` and `ny` is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
