The code assigns the value of the element in the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny` to `ncur`. Given that `nx` is between 0 and `N-1` and `ny` is also between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` will take the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The states of `nx`, `ny`, and other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2**.
