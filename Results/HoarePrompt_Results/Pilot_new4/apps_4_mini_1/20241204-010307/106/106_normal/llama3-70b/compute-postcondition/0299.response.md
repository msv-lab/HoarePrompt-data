Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, after executing the loop, `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated for each valid move if `piece` is 0 and the condition `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` is satisfied, `parent[0][ncur]` will be set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` will include all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples. If no valid moves exist, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their state prior to the loop execution.**
