The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Since `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `dist[1][ncur]` will be based on the current distance at index `cur`, incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` is unchanged, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
