Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[0][ncur]` continues to represent the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` holds updated parent positions, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.***
