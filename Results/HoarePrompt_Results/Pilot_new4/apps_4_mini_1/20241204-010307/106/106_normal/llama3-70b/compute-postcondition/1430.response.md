Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
