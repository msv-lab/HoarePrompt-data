The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are currently -1 and `N-2`, respectively. Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, the value of `ny` can range from 1 (when `N = 3`) to 8 (when `N = 10`). The value of `nx` is -1, and this gives us an index outside the bounds of a typical 2D array, which may lead to an error unless `A` has been defined to handle negative indices in some manner. However, assuming `A` is defined with negative indices, we can still evaluate.

Since the value of `ncur` is being fetched directly from the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`, it introduces that `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N-2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N-2`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N-2]`.**
