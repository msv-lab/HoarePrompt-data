The code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The states of the other variables are not affected directly by this assignment. We maintain the conditions around `N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the distance-related conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
