The value of `ncur` is assigned from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the current positions `x` and `y` adjusted by `dx` and `dy`, respectively. Since we know that the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N` are satisfied, we can conclude that `ncur` will hold a value from the `A` array within valid indices.

The states of other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` holds corresponding values, `queue` contains reachable `ncur` values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` holds corresponding values, `queue` contains reachable `ncur` values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
