Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is not met, no actions are taken.***
