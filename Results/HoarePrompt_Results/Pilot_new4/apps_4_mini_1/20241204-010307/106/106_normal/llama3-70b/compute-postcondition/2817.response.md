According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the given list. Since there are 8 tuples in total, the loop will execute 8 times for the respective coordinate changes.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed one of the tuples. Assuming it was the last tuple `(2, 1)`, the loop would now be at the next tuple in the list, which does not exist. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to start over from the first tuple in the list.

However, the current state should reflect the next iteration where the loop can execute again. In this case, we will need to reset the iteration index to the start of the tuple list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples including `(ncur, 0)`, `(dx, dy)` is the first tuple in the list, which is `(-2, -1)`**
