The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` is `0`, `dx` is `-2`, `y` is `0`, and `dy` is `1`, we can calculate the new values:

- `nx = 0 + (-2) = -2`
- `ny = 0 + 1 = 1`

The values of `N`, `A`, `cur`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1**
