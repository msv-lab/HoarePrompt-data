According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. Since `N` is an integer with the constraint `3 <= N <= 10`, the loop will execute a total of `N` times, starting from `y = 0` up to `y = N - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `y` should be initialized to 0, and we also need to ensure that `N` satisfies the given constraints.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0**
