The code `queue.append((cur, i))` appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 2)` pairs, and since the condition states that the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, this operation is valid. The values of `cur` and `i` are not specified in the initial state but are required for the tuple being appended. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `dist[2]` reflects the minimum distances from the starting point to each valid `ncur` position; `parent[2]` contains the corresponding parent positions for each updated `ncur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` appended to its previous contents; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
