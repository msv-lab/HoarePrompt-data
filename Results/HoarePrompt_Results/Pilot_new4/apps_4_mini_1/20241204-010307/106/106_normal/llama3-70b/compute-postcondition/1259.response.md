The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the values of `dx` and `dy`. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but `nx` would become `x + dx` and `ny` would become `y + dy`. Thus, the calculated values for `nx` and `ny` depend on `dx` and `dy`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is the same as before, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions based on conditions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken for those updated positions, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions that met the conditions, `piece` is 0; `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`.**
