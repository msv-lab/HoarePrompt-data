The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` is executed, which means a tuple consisting of `ncur` and the integer `1` is added to the list `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur] = (cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur] = (cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
