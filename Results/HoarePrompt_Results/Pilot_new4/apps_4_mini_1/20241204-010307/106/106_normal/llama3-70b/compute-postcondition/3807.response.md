To analyze the impact of the code snippet `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, we first recognize the variables involved:

- `nx` is defined as `2 + dx`
- `ny` is defined as `1 + dy`
- The array `A` is accessed using the computed indices `nx` and `ny`.

At this point, we do not know the values of `dx` and `dy`, but we do know that:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1

The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are not provided.

Since `ncur` is assigned a value based on the indices `nx` and `ny`, the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state must include the definitions of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny`, along with the new assignment for `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
