The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variables affected by this operation are only `queue`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ncur` is determined by the initial state and the calculations leading to it. Thus, the `queue` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, 2)`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`.**
