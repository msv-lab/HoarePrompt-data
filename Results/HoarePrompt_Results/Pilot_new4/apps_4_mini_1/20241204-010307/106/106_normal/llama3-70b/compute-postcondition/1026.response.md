Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 1, `nx` is 0 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains corresponding `cur` values for updated `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` appended during loop execution. The current value of `nx` is between 0 and N-1, and the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N-1.***
