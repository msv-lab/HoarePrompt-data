Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for all valid moves and now includes `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`. `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N-1`; `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
