The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, where `dx` and `dy` are values that determine the next coordinates based on some movement logic. The previous values of `x` and `y` are unknown, but their new values will be determined by the addition of `dx` and `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny` based on the initial values of `x` and `y` plus the respective deltas.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid moves `(nx, ny)` that were within bounds, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of the previous indices leading to each `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid moves `(ncur, 1)` for each update made during the iterations, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`**.
