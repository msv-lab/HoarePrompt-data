Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, `parent` is valid for reachable indices, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` is set according to loop conditions, `cur` is valid for index calculations, `x` is a valid index, `y` is a valid index, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).***
