Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances for all reachable `ncur` positions from the current position `(x, y)` based on valid knight moves, `parent[2][ncur]` stores the associated parent positions for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` for each valid knight move executed, along with previously existing tuples. If no valid moves occur, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
