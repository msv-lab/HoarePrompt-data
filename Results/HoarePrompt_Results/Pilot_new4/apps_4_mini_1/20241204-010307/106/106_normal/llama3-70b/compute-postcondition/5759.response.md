The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, `nx` becomes `x - 1` and `ny` remains equal to `y`. Therefore, the new values are `nx = x - 1` and `ny = y`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y.**
