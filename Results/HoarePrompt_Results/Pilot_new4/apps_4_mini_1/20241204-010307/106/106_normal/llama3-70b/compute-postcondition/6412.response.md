According to the code, the for loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates (dx, dy). In this case, there are 8 pairs of (dx, dy) values. The variable `x` and `y` determine the current position, and for each iteration, the loop iterates to the next pair in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1, which means the loop has processed the first two pairs of (dx, dy) values. After the loop processes the last pair, the next iteration would use the third pair.

In terms of iterations:
- The loop has executed with the first pair `(-2, -1)` and the second pair `(-2, 1)`.
- The next index pair to be processed will be `(-1, -2)`.

Given this, the state needs to reflect that the loop has moved to the next iteration with the updated values of `dx` and `dy`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N, then `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` and the queue now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
