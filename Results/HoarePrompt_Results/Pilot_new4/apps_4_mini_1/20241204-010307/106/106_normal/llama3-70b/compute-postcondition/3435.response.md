The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and assigns the value of `piece` to the same position in the `parent` array. The values of `parent[0][ncur]` and `piece` are now defined by the value of `cur` and the variable `piece`, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `piece`.**
