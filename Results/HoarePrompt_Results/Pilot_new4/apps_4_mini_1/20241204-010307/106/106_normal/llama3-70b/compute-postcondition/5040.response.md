Postcondition: ***If `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `ncur` is not assigned a valid value, and the `queue` now contains `(None, 1)`. There is no else part in the code.***
