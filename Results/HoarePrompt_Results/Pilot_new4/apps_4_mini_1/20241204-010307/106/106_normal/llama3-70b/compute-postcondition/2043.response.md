Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, where `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance calculated from `dist[0][cur]` plus the number of steps taken; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents, where `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to reflect the last piece that led to `ncur`; `piece` remains unchanged at 2, unless it was initially 0; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, namely `(cur, i)` and all valid `(ncur, 0)` entries for reachable indices; `dx` and `dy` represent the tuples iterated over for movement, and `ncur` is the value obtained from `A[nx][ny]` for all valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates. If the loop does not execute, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
