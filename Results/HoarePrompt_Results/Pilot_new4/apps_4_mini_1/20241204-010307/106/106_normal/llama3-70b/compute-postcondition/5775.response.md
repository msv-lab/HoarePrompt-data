Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if the loop executed, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum distances from `cur` for all updated `ncur` where `piece` is 2; `parent[2][ncur]` holds the values `(cur, piece)` for each updated `ncur`; the `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 2) for all valid `ncur` that met the distance condition; if the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged for those `ncur`; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
