The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `0` are not altered by this operation; instead, the operation affects the `queue` variable by adding a new element. The previous values of `ncur` (which is the result of `A[-2][1]`) and `0` remain unchanged. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-2][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned an undefined value from `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
