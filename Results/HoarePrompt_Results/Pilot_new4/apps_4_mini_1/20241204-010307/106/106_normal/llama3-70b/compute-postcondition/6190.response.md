The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, where `ncur` is previously defined as `A[x - 1][1]` and `cur` is a variable that is assumed to have a defined value. The output state will now reflect that `parent[2][ncur]` has been updated to the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][1]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, 2)**.
