The variables `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `(dx, dy)`, where `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 1. Therefore, we compute:

- \( nx = x + dx = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
- \( ny = y + dy = 0 + 1 = 1 \)

The values of `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The initial state of `N` being between 3 and 10 is still valid, as it is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dist` remains unchanged; `parent` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1**.
