Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
