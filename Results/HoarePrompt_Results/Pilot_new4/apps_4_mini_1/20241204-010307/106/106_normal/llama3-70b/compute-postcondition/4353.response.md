The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The initial state provides that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is derived from the grid based on the indices `nx` and `ny`. Since `piece` is equal to 2, `parent[2][ncur]` is now updated with these two values.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid prior values, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the value of `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid prior values, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the value of `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`.**
