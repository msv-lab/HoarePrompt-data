Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices and `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 2 while `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
