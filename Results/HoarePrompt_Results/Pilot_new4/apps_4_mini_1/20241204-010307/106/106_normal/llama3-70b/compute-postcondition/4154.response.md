Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is either -1 or 1, `ny` is either 1 or 3. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made. If the conditions are not met, no actions are taken.***
