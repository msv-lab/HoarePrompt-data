The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple containing `cur` and `i` to the list `queue`. The initial state does not change any of the other variables; it only modifies `queue` by appending the new element. Since the initial conditions specify that `piece` is not equal to `i`, this operation continues to hold true after the execution.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position based on valid moves for piece 2, `parent[2]` contains the parent pointers corresponding to the updated distances for piece 2, `queue` now contains all previously reachable states plus the new state `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
