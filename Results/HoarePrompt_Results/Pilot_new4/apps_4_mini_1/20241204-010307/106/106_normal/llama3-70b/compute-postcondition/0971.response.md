The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The current values are `x = 0`, `dx = -2`, `y = 2`, and `dy = -1`. 

Calculating these:
- `nx = 0 + (-2) = -2`
- `ny = 2 + (-1) = 1`

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1**
