According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of `dx` and `dy` specified in the list. The loop will execute once for each pair in the list. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine what the state will be for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `piece` is equal to 1. The loop has already processed one of the pairs from the list. The pairs in the list are `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`, making a total of 4 iterations.

If we consider that the loop has iterated once, we can infer that the current state of the loop variables (dx, dy) will move to the next pair in the list. 

Since there are 4 pairs in total, if the loop has processed one iteration, it will be processing the second pair next. The next pair to be processed would be `(-1, 1)`.

So for the loop to execute one more time, we need to describe the state in terms of what the next `dx` and `dy` would be.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, dx is -1, dy is 1**
