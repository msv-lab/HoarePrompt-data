Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][7]`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
