Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
