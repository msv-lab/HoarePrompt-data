The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the value in a 2D array `parent`. The variable `ncur` is already defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and thus it is being assigned the value of `cur` in the parent array at the specified indices. The other variables remain unchanged.

The output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment made to `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
