The statement `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The variable `ncur` is already assigned a value based on `A[nx][ny]`, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. The variable `piece` remains unchanged as it was initialized to `0`. The other variables, including `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `parent`, remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value (cur, piece); and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value (cur, piece); `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
