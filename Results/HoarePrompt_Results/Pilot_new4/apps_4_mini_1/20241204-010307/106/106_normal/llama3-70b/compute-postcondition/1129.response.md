Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[2][0]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
