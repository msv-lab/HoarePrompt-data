The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, as well as the values of `dx` and `dy`. However, the values for `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, which means the impact on `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined specifically. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state, only indicating that `nx` and `ny` will change according to the addition of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` must contain at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)` where all conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` were met; `piece` remains 0 for the tuples in `queue`; `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`; `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`.**
