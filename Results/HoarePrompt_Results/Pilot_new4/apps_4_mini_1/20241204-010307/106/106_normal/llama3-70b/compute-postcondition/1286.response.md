The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial values for `x` and `y` are 1 and 2, but the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided. Based on the given information, we know that `N` is between 3 and 10, which means that valid updates to `nx` and `ny` must satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.

Since the specific values for `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot compute specific values for `nx` and `ny`. However, we can state that `nx` will be `1 + dx` and `ny` will be `2 + dy`. Both `nx` and `ny` must also meet the condition of being within the bounds dictated by `N`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and must satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
