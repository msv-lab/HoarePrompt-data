In the given code, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The previous state defines `nx` as `1 + dx` and `ny` as `0 + dy`. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to the value in the 2D array `A` at the indices determined by `nx` and `ny`.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, the other variables remain unchanged unless specifically mentioned. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` also remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the assignment made to `ncur` based on the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2 if the conditions are met; `dist[2][ncur]` must be greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` if conditions are unmet; `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged; `queue` may include the next position accordingly.**
