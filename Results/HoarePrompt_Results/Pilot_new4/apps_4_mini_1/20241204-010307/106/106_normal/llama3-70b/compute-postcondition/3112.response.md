Postcondition: ***If `N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, then `ncur` is set to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
