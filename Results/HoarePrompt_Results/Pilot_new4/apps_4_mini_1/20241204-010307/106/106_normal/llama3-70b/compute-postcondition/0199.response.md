Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`; `ny` is equal to `N + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` added to it.**
