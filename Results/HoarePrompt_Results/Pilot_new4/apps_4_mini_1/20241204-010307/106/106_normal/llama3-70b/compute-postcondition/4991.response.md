Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains tuples including `(cur, i)` added to it, while `dist`, `parent`, and other variables remain unchanged. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their original state.***
