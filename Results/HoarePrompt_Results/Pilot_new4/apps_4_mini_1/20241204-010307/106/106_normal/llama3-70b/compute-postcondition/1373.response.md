Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances updated based on valid moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding previous positions for reachable states; `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves; `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`; `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates. If no valid moves were possible, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` maintain their initial state.**
