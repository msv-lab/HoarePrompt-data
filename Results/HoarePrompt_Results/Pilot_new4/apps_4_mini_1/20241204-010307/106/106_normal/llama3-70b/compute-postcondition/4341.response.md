The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The value of `ncur` is assigned from `A[nx][ny]`, but since the specific values of `dist`, `cur`, and `A` are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that the value of `dist[1][ncur]` is now one greater than the previous value of `dist[1][cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
