The `queue` variable is updated by appending a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer `1`. The values of `dist`, `piece`, `index`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `parent` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated state of `queue`.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices; `piece` is equal to 1; `index` in directions is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]; parent[1][ncur] is updated to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains (ncur, 1).**
