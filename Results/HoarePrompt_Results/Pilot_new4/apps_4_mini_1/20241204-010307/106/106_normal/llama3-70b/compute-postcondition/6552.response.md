According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of direction tuples, `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`, which represent changes in the `x` and `y` coordinates. Each iteration of the loop modifies the variables `nx` and `ny` based on the current `dx` and `dy` values.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `x` is between 0 and `N-1`.
- `y` is between 0 and `N-1`.
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`.
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

We need to consider the next iteration of the loop:
1. In the first iteration, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0.
2. In the second iteration, `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0.
3. In the third iteration, `dx` is 0 and `dy` is -1.
4. In the fourth iteration, `dx` is 0 and `dy` is 1.

Since there are four iterations in total, we will adjust `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration, which will be the third iteration (0, -1).

If we are currently in the second iteration, then after it, `dx` will be 0 and `dy` will be -1. We must ensure that `nx` and `ny` computed from this next `dx` and `dy` are within bounds. 

Thus, we will have:
- `nx` will be `x + 0` (which is still `x`).
- `ny` will be `y - 1`.

Considering the bounds again:
- `nx` must satisfy `0 <= x < N`.
- `ny` must satisfy `0 <= y - 1 < N`, which implies `y` must be greater than 0 to be within bounds.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `y` to be greater than 0.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`**
