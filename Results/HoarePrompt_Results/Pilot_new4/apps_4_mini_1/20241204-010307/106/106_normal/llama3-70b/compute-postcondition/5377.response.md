The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The preconditions indicate that `ncur` is determined by the current positions of `nx` and `ny`, and it assumes valid values as per the distance and path information provided.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `parent[1][ncur]`, while all other variables maintain their initial states.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` contains valid distances for at least one move, `parent[0][ncur]` contains valid path information, `queue` contains valid tuples for the current position and piece, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
