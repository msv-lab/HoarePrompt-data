Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. If the conditions for the if statement are not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
