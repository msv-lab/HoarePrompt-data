Postcondition: ***`dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
