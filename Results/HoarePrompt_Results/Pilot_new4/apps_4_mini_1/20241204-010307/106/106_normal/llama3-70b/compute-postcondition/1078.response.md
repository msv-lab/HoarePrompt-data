The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions provided. Here, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. 

Given:
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is -1

Calculating:
- `nx = 1 + (-2) = -1`
- `ny = 0 + (-1) = -1`

Other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions about `N` do not affect the changes of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1**
