Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` contains the updated minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points, `parent` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, and `queue` contains the tuples representing the reachable points and their associated pieces. The current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`.***
