The assignment statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. The previous state tells us that `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be one more than the value of `dist[0][cur]`. 

Given the precondition that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this means the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` must have been at least `dist[0][cur] + 2` before the update. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 

`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is now -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is now -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
