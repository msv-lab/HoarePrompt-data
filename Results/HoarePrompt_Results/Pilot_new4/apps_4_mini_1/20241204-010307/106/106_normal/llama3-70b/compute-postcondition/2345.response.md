The code snippet updates the value in the `dist` array at index `[2][ncur]` to be equal to the value of `dist[2][cur]` incremented by 1. The specific values of `dist[2][cur]` and `ncur` are relevant here, but since we have not been provided with their values, we can only describe the output in terms of their variables.

The previous state of `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` is not directly affected by this operation, but we need to specify the new value for `dist[2][ncur]`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
