The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are involved in this assignment. The preconditions regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and the relationships among these variables are unchanged, except for the new assignment to `parent[2][ncur]`.

Since `dist[2][ncur]` was already established to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the condition regarding its value relative to `dist[2][cur]` remains valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` has been updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
