The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is 2 and `dy` is 1, the new values become `nx = x + 2` and `ny = y + 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `A`, and the relationships of `cur`, `nx`, and `ny` with respect to `x` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1.**
