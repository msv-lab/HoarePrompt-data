The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The value of `cur` is known as `A[x][-1]`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`. The initial values of `dist[1][cur]` and `dist[1][ncur]` are not provided, but the calculation for `dist[1][ncur]` is dependent on `dist[1][cur]`.

Since `dist[1][ncur]` is being updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, the output state indicates that `dist[1][ncur]` has been incremented by 1 based on the current value of `dist[1][cur]`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
