Postcondition: ***If N is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1, `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][-1]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to (cur, 1), and `queue` contains (ncur, 1) as well as (None, 1). If the conditions are not met, no changes occur in the state of the relevant variables.***
