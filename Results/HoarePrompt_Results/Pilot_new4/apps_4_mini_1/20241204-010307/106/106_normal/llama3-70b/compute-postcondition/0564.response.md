The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are previously computed to ensure they are within the bounds of the array. All other variables remain unchanged. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, ensuring that the assignment of `ncur` is valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` is updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` stores the previous position and piece for each reachable position, `queue` contains all the valid `(ncur, 0)` positions, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
