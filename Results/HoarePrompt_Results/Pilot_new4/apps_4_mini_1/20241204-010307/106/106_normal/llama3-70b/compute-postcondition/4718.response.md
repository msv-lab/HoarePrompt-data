Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x][1]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated; `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1. If `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
