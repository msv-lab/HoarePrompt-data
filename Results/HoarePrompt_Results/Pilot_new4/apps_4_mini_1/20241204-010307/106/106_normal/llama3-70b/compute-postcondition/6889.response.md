The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` is currently greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this assignment will result in `dist[2][ncur]` being updated to a new value that is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` remain unchanged except for the updated value of `dist[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is updated based on the reachable cells from (x, y); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1; the current value of `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
