The `queue` gets updated by appending a tuple containing `(ncur, 2)` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the tuple will reflect the calculated value based on `nx` and `ny`. The conditions for `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include `ncur, 2`.**
