Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is updated to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, having decreased from its previous value, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` if `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1`. If the conditions are not met, there are no changes to the states of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
