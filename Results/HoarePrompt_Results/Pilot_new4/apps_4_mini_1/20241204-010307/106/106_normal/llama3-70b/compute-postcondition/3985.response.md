The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are both 1, which means `ncur` will be equal to the element at the second row and second column of the 2D array `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[1][1]`.**
