The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The previous values are as follows: `x` is 2, `dx` is -1, `y` is 2, and `dy` is 1. Therefore, `nx` becomes `2 + (-1)` which is `1`, and `ny` becomes `2 + 1` which is `3`.

Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 3.**
