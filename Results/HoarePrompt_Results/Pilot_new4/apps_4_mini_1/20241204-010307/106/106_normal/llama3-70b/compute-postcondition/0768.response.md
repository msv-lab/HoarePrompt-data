Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`***
