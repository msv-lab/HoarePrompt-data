Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][1]`, and if `piece` is 2 and the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, 2), and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
