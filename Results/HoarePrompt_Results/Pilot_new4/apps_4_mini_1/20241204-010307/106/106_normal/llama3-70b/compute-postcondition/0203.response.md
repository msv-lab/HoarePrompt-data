The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -2, this means:

- `nx` becomes `x - 1`
- `ny` becomes `y - 2`

Since `y` is equal to `N`, we can also express `ny` as `N - 2`. The previous conditions regarding `N`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` still hold.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N - 2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N - 2.**
