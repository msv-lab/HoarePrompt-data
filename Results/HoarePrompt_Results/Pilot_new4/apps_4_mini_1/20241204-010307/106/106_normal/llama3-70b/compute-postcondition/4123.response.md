The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given the condition that the distance from `ncur` is greater than the distance from `cur` plus 1, it implies that `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which contradicts the original condition. However, the specific value of `dist[0][cur]` is not provided, and as such, we cannot compute the exact value of `dist[0][ncur]`.

Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, we summarize the changes accordingly.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
