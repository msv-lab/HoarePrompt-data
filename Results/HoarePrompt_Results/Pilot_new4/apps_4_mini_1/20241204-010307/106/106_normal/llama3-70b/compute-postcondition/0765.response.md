The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `dist[2][ncur]`, which is now updated, and `dist[2][cur]`, which remains unchanged. The other variables retain their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and the distance from the second piece at `ncur` is now `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
