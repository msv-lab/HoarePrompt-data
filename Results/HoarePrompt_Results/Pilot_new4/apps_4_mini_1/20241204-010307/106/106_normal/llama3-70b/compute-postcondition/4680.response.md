The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` based on the current distance `dist[1][cur]`. 

- The variable `ncur` is already defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which means it holds a specific value from the array `A` based on the computed indices `nx` and `ny`.
- The current value of `dist[1][ncur]` will now be set to the value of `dist[1][cur]` plus 1. 

However, we have not defined or mentioned `cur` in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `dist[1][cur]` or the new value of `dist[1][ncur]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` (the specific value of `dist[1][cur]` is unknown).**
