In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the existing values of `x`, `y`, and the direction tuple `(dx, dy)`. Since `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, their specific values are unknown. Therefore, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`.

The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, and `y` is 0. The conditions regarding `nx` and `ny` remain valid after this operation. However, without knowing the values of `x`, `dx`, or `dy`, we can only state that `nx` and `ny` are derived from the initial values of `x` and `y`.

As a result, the Output State is: 
`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `y + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `y + dy`.**
