The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. This operation alters the state of the `queue` variable by adding a new element, but it does not affect any of the other variables present in the initial state.

The initial values are preserved, and the only change is that `ncur` is added to the `queue` along with `0`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ny` is between 1 and 15 (inclusive), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
