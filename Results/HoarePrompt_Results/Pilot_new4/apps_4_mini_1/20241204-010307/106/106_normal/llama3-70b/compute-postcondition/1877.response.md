The line of code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[1][ncur]`. Given that the current value of `piece` is 1 and the condition `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this line effectively sets `dist[1][ncur]` to a new value that is one greater than `dist[1][cur]`. 

Since `dist[1][ncur]` is updated from its previous value, we know:
- `dist[1][ncur]` was originally greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, hence it will now be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, `parent` is valid for reachable indices, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` is set according to loop conditions, `cur` is valid for index calculations, `x` is a valid index, `y` is a valid index, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current value of `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
