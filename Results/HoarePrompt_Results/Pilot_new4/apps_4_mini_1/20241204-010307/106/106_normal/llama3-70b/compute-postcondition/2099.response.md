The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. Since `piece` remains equal to 2 and is not equal to `i`, we can infer that the loop does execute and `queue` is modified. The states of `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged from their initial values. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for all reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, `piece` remains 2, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` entries generated during the iterations along with the new entry `(cur, i)`.**
