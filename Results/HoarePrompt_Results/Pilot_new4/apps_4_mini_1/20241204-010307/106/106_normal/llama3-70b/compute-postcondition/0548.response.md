The code assigns values to `parent[0][ncur]` using the current values of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur`, `piece`, and `ncur` are determined by the existing state, but they are not specified in the initial state. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `A`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
