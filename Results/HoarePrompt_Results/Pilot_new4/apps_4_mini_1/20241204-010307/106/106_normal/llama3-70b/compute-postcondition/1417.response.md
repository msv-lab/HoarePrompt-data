`nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, meaning we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, `nx` and `ny` will depend on the unknown values of `dx` and `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`**
