The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` have been defined such that they are derived from `x` and `y` using `dx` and `dy`, and are guaranteed to be within the range of 0 to `N` (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `N`). The initial state does not indicate the specific values of `A`, `x`, or `y`, but since `ncur` is a valid index for `dist` and `parent` updates, it can be inferred that `ncur` will hold a value from the 2D array `A` based on the current indices `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0), `dist` must be initialized for `N` values, `parent` must be initialized for `N` values, `piece` must be defined before the loop, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N` (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `N`).**
