Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. The current value of `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, and `parent[1][ncur]` indicates parents for each `ncur`, while `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`, with `ncur` equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
