The code modifies the `dist` array at the position `[2][ncur]`. The value assigned to this position is calculated by taking the current value `dist[2][cur]` and adding 1 to it. The values of `piece`, `(dx, dy)`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code.

Given that `ncur` is defined as `A[x + 1][y]`, the output state retains the relationships and values of the variables as they were, but updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0), `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
