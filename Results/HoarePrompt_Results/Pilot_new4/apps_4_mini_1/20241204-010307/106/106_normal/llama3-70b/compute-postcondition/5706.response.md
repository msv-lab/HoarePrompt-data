The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`. The values of `N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged; only `ncur` is affected. The specific value of `ncur` depends on the value of `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. Therefore, we maintain the current state of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
