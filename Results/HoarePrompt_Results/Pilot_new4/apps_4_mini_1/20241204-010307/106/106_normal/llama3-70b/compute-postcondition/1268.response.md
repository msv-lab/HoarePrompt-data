According to the code, the for loop iterates over four possible direction changes represented by the tuples `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. Each tuple corresponds to a direction in which adjustments to `nx` and `ny` can be made. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following state: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of updated positions, and `piece` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it will iterate through the next direction tuple. Since each iteration of the loop will take one of the tuples, we need to keep track of which tuple was last processed. 

Since we started with the first tuple `(-1, -1)`, we can assume that we have processed it in the previous iteration. The next tuples are `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)` in order. After processing `(-1, -1)`, the next direction tuple will be `(-1, 1)`, so we can expect the next states to adjust according to this.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, and `piece` is 1. The next direction tuple is `(-1, 1)`**.
