Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values where the piece is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`***
