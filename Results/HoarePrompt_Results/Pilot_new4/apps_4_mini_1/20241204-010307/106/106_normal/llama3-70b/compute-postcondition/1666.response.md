The line of code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `i` to the `queue`. Since `cur` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, we assume they hold their current values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur` based on valid knight moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` added to it. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
