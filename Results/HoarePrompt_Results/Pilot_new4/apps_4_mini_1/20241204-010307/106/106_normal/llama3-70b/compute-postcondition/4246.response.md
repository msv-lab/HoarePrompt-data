The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `1 + dx` and `N - 1 + dy`, respectively. Since the initial state defines `A[x][y]` as equal to `cur`, but does not specify values for `A[nx][ny]`, we can only express `ncur` in terms of `A[nx][ny]`.

The state of other variables remains unchanged, so the output state reflects the new assignment of `ncur`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, `queue` contains the tuples representing all reachable points and their associated pieces after processing all valid moves defined by the `dx` and `dy` offsets, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
