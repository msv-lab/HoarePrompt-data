The variables `nx` and `ny` are updated with the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `dx` is 0, so `nx` will equal `x + 0`, which simplifies to `nx = x`. The value of `dy` is -1, so `ny` will equal `y - 1`. The variable `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), so after decrementing it by 1, `ny` will be between -1 and 7. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is between -1 and 7 (inclusive)**
