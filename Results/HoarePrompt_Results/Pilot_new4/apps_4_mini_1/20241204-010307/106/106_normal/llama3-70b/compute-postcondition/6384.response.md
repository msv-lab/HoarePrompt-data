The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, which indicates the relationship between the indices in the `parent` structure. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but it is important to note that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
