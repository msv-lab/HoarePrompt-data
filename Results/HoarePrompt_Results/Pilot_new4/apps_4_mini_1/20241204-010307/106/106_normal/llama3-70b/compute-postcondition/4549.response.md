Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1; `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position that meet the conditions; if `piece` is 2, then for each valid `(nx, ny)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)` for all valid `ncur` positions; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
