The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0` to `N-1`, and `A[1][0]` is equal to `cur`, we know that `A` is a valid 2D array and that `ncur` will be assigned a specific value based on the indices `nx` and `ny`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dist[0]` has been updated for valid positions, `parent[0]` is set accordingly, `queue` contains valid tuples from previous executions, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0` to `N-1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
