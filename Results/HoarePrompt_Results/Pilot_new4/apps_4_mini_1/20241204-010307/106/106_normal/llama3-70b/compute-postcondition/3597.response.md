Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2` (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
