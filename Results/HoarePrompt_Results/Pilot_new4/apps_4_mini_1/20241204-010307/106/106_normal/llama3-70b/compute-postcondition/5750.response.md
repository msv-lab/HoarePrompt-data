Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1); `dist[1][ncur]` is updated accordingly; `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `nx` is within the range 0 to N-1, and `ny` is within the range 0 to N-1.***
