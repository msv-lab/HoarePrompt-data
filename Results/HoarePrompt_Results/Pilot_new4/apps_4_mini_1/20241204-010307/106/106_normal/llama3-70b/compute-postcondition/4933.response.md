Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and N-2, `dx` and `dy` are processed, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds [0, N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` has appended `(ncur, 0)`. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
