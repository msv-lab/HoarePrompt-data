The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The variables that have been updated are `parent[1][ncur]`, which is now equal to `cur`. The other variables retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` is updated accordingly for the next iteration, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
