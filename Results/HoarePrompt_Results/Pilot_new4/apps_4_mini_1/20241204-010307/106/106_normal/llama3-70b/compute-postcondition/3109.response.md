The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the element `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are now associated with the index `ncur` in the `parent` array for the first row. The states of the other variables, including `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the `dist` array, remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.**
