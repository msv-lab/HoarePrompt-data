The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The other variables, including `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, remain unchanged. Therefore, since `parent` is updated, but other variables are not affected, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[dx][2 + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`, `queue` remains unchanged.**
