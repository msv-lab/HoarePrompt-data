The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `A` is presumably a two-dimensional array. The values of `nx` and `ny` are constrained by the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The value of `ncur` will depend on the specific values stored in `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected; hence, the output state reflects that `ncur` now holds the value `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0 (for the first iteration), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
