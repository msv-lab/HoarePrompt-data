Postcondition: ***If `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and the `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part in the code.***
