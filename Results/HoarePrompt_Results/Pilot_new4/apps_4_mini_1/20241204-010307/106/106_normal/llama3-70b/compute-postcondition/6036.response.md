Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distance from the starting point to `ncur` using piece equal to 2, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur` when piece is 2, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and the appended `(ncur, 2)` tuples for all valid updates made during the iterations, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
