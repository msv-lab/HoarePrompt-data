The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are added to the `queue` without modifying any other variables. The previous values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `cur`, and `dist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` remains equal to 2; the next (dx, dy) is (1, 0); `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][0]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, 2); `queue` now contains (ncur, 2).**
