The `queue` variable is updated by appending a tuple `(cur, i)` to it. There are no changes to the other variables `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece`, as the loop did not execute, and the preconditions remain valid. The value of `cur` and `i` are not specified in the initial state but represent the current state values that are being added to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, `piece` remains unchanged, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
