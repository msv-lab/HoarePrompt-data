The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The exact values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `x` and `y`. Given that `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, the expressions for `nx` and `ny` will be `2 + dx` and `1 + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` is empty.**
