The `queue` is updated by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `1`. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]`. Therefore, the state of `queue` changes to include this new position, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`; `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`; `queue` contains reachable positions which can now include `(ncur, 1)`; `queue` must not be empty; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]`; `(dx, dy)` is `(-1, -1)` for the next iteration; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur] = cur`; `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 1)`**.
