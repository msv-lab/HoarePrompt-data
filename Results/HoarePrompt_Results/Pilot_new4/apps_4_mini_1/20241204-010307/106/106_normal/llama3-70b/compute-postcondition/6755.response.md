The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array where the first index is `0` and the second index is `ncur`. The variable `cur` is assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`, and `piece` is also associated with this assignment, but it is not specified how `piece` is defined or used alongside it. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The initial states of the variables remain valid, with the exception of `parent[0][ncur]` which now holds the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece` is associated with `parent[0][ncur]`**.
