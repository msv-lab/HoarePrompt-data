Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`. If `nx` (where `nx = x + dx`) and `ny` (where `ny = 1 + dy`) are both valid indices such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not satisfied, no changes are made.***
