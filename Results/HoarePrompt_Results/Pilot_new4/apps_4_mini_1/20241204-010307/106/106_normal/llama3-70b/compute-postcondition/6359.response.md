Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is updated to `dx`, `ny` is updated to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`, if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` is assigned, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
