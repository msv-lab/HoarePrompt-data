The code assigns the value `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. This means that `parent[2][ncur]` now holds a tuple consisting of the value of `cur` and the value of `piece`. Since no other variables are changed by this operation, the rest of the initial state remains the same. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but they are retained in the output state as part of the tuple assigned to `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x][1]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated; `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1; parent[2][ncur] = (cur, piece)`**.
