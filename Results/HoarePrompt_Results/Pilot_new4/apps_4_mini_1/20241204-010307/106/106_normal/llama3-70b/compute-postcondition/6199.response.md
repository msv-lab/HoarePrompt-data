The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are still valid after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
