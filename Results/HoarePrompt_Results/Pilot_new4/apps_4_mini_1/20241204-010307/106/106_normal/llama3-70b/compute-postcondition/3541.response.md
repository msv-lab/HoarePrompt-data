Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is within `0` and `N-1`; `y` is within `0` and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for reachable positions based on the conditions of the loop; `parent[0][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`; `queue` now contains the previous positions plus the new position `(ncur, 1)`; `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged for any unreachable positions; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
