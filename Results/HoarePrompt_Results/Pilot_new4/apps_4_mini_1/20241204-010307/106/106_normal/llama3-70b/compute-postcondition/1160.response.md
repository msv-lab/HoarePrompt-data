The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the constant `0` are now part of the `queue`, but no other variables have been modified by this code.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `ncur` is still `A[-1][0]`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[-1][0]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
