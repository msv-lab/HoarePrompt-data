The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0, `nx` will be equal to `x + 1` and `ny` will remain equal to `y`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, and `ny` is `y`.
