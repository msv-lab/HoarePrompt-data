According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible directions represented by the tuples in the list `[( -1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. Each iteration of the loop processes one direction change based on `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the important states to consider are the contents of `dist`, `cur`, and the list of directions itself. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are remaining tuples in the list to iterate over. 

Since the current loop iteration processes one tuple at a time and the next tuple from the list will be used, we need to track the state as follows:

1. The loop will iterate over the four tuples: hence after processing one tuple in the current iteration, there will be three tuples remaining to process.
2. The next tuple (`(dx, dy)`) from the list will depend on how many iterations have already taken place. If this is the first iteration, the next `dx` and `dy` will be the second tuple from the list.

Assuming that this is the first iteration (or any prior iteration), we can conclude from the current state that once the loop processes the first tuple, it will move to the second tuple.

State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `cur` is the current position, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` and `dy` will be the second tuple from the list (1, 0) in the next iteration.**
