The code attempts to assign a value to `ncur` from `A[nx][ny]`, but since `ny` is invalid (it is -1), it cannot retrieve a valid value for `ncur`. Therefore, `ncur` remains unchanged or is not assigned a value at all.

The code then tries to assign a value to `dist[1][ncur]` based on the current state of `ncur`, but since `ncur` could not be assigned a valid value due to the invalid index, this assignment cannot be completed.

Since the code does not modify any of the valid variables or states, the output state remains as it was initially, with the exception that the attempted assignment of `dist[1][ncur]` is invalid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1 (invalid), and the attempted assignment of `dist[1][ncur]` based on invalid `ncur` is not performed.**
