Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` includes the previous contents plus the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1. If `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist[2][ncur]` or `parent[2][ncur]`.***
