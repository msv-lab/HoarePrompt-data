To analyze the code snippet given the initial state:

Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

The code:
```
dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1
```

In this operation, the value in the `dist` array at the position `[1][ncur]` is updated to be the value at `[1][cur]` incremented by 1. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and the `dist` array are affected. 

Since `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, it is influenced by the values of `nx` and `ny`, which depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. However, since we don't have concrete values for `dx`, `dy`, or `cur`, we can only express the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
