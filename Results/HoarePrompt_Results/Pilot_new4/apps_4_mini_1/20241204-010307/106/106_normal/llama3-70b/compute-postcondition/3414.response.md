The operation `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. Since `piece` is still equal to 2 and does not equal `i`, the state of `piece` remains unchanged. The state of the other variables such as `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` will also remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified by this code. The only change here is the addition of the tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances for all reachable `ncur` positions from the current position `(x, y)` based on valid knight moves, `parent[2][ncur]` stores the associated parent positions for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` in addition to the previously existing tuples.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances for all reachable `ncur` positions from the current position `(x, y)` based on valid knight moves, `parent[2][ncur]` stores the associated parent positions for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` along with the newly added tuple `(cur, i)`.**
