The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the increments defined by `dx` and `dy`. The initial state indicates that `y` has already been incremented by 1, so the new value of `y` is now `y + 1`. The states of the other variables do not change, but `nx` and `ny` will be equal to the values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The conditions regarding `N` and its relationship with `y + 1` remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `y + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `N` must be greater than `y + 1`.**
