Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and `N-1`; if the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` holds true, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
