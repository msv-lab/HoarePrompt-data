The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` using the current values of `x` and `y` and the increments defined by `dx` and `dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are not provided, the output will remain in terms of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
