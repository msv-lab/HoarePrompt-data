According to the code, the loop iterates over a set of directional moves defined by the pairs \((dx, dy)\). There are no specific constraints on the enumerated values that would prevent the loop from executing, as it is a fixed iteration over four predefined pairs. 

For the loop to execute, no changes to the states are needed. The variables `N`, `x`, and `y` do not affect the iteration of this loop since the loop will execute a fixed number of times regardless of those values. The only requirement for the loop to be meaningful is that it runs through its defined pairs.

Thus, the necessary state adjustments are:
State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for reachable positions based on the conditions of the loop, `parent[0][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `queue` contains all positions reachable by the current piece from `(x,y)` using the defined moves, `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged for any unreachable positions**
