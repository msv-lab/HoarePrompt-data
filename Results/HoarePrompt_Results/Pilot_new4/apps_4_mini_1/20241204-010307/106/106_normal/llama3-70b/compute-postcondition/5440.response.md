According to the code, the loop will iterate over the list of tuples representing the movements defined by `dx` and `dy`. Each iteration will pick a new `(dx, dy)` pair to execute the loop body. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 4 and `y` is 2. The loop will execute a total of 8 times since there are 8 tuples in the list.

Since we are currently on the last iteration of the loop with `dx` and `dy` values, we need to determine what happens to the variables when the loop iterates one more time. The iteration for the last pair will take the values `dx` and `dy` from the last tuple `(2, 1)`, and we want to prepare for the next iteration where the loop will pull the first tuple from the list, which is `(-2, -1)`.

Since the loop has completed its last iteration using `(2, 1)`, and we want to adjust for the start of the loop again, we need to set `dx` to -2 and `dy` to -1 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + (-2)`, `ny` is equal to `2 + (-1)`, and both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1.**
