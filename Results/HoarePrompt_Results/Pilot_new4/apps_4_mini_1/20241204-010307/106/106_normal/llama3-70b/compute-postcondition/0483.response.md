The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are -1, which means `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will be `y - 1`. 

Given that `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, and `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` can take values from 0 to 9. Consequently:
- `y` starts at 2, and after adding `dy`, which is -1, `ny` will be 1.
- `nx` will be affected by the current value of `x`.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated values of `nx` and `ny` while keeping the conditions for `N` and the other variables intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 1.**
