In the provided code snippet, the variable `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`. The variable `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x` and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `piece` is `2`
- `nx` is equal to `x`
- `ny` is equal to `y + 1`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`

The line of code modifies `dist[2][ncur]`, assigning it the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Since the initial values of `dist` and `cur` are not provided, we can only state that `dist[2][ncur]` will be updated accordingly.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated `dist[2][ncur]` based on the given conditions, while keeping the initial state of other variables intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
