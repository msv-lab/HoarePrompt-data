The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `queue` is now updated to include the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
