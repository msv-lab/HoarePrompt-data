Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.***
