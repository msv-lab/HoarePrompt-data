The line of code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `cur`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, `queue`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged in state.

Given that `ncur` is defined as `A[1][1]`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dist[1][ncur]`, which is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[1][1]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
