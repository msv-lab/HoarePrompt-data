Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `x` is between 2 and N-1; `nx` can be `x - 1` or `x + 1`; `ny` can be -1 or 1 based on the pairs in `dx` and `dy`; 0 <= `nx` < `N`; 0 <= `ny` < `N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to (cur, 1), and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
