Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` now contains all the tuples of positions that were valid and explored during the loop execution plus the tuple `(cur, i)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(x, y)` considering all valid knight's moves, and `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves. If `piece` equals `i`, the state remains unchanged, as none of the variables are modified.***
