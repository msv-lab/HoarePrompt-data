The code snippet assigns the value `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. Given the initial state, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The conditions also state that the distance from `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which implies that the assignment will update `dist[1][ncur]` to a value that is immediately one unit greater than `dist[1][cur]`. 

Since we have `dist[1][ncur]` being updated, the only variable affected in this case is `dist`. The other variables retain their initial conditions without change.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `x` is between 2 and N-1; `nx` can be `x - 1` or `x + 1`; `ny` can be -1 or 1 based on the pairs in `dx` and `dy`; 0 <= `nx` < `N`; 0 <= `ny` < `N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; distance from `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
