The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, combined with `dx` and `dy`, which are presumably defined elsewhere in the code. The values of `x` and `y` are currently `0` and `1`, respectively. The new values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy` but are currently unknown. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` may contain tuples of positions that were explored.**
