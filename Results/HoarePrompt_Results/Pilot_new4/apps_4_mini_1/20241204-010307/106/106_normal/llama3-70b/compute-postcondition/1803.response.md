The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The variable `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `piece` remain unchanged. However, we need to determine the specific values for `nx` and `ny` based on the initial state of `y`, which is 2. Thus, `ny` will be `2 - 1 = 1`. The value of `nx` depends on `x`, which was not defined in the initial state, so it remains as `x + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][1]`.**
