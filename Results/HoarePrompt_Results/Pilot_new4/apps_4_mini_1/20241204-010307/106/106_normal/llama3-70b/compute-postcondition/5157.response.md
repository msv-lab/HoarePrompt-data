The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. Since `nx` is defined as `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`, the value of `ncur` will depend on the values of `x` and `y`, which are both between 0 and N-1, and `N` is defined as being between 4 and 10. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`.**
