According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing direction changes (dx, dy). The loop will execute four times, once for each direction. At the end of the last iteration, we have `dx` and `dy` corresponding to the last tuple in the list, which is (0, 1). 

To execute the loop one more time, the next tuple in the list must be used. Since the loop will iterate over the specified list of tuples, it will cycle back to the first tuple after the last one. Therefore, we need to reset to the first tuple (-1, 0) for the next iteration.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:
- `dx` will be -1
- `dy` will be 0

The other variables remain unchanged as they do not directly influence the loop's execution in this context.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 0`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
