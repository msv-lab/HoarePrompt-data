The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is determined to be equal to `A[nx][0]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
