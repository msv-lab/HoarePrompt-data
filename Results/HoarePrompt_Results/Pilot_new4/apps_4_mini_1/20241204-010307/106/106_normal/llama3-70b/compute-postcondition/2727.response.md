The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is already defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which is derived from `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
