The code assigns the value of `ncur` to the element in array `A` at the indices determined by `nx` and `ny`. Given the initial state, we know that `ny` is `N` and `nx` is `-1`. 

However, the specific values of `A[-1][N]` depend on the implementation of the array and the definition of `A`. Thus, the output state will reflect that `ncur` is assigned a value from the array `A`, specifically from the indices determined by `nx` and `ny`.

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `A[x][y]`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged in the output state. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N]`.**
