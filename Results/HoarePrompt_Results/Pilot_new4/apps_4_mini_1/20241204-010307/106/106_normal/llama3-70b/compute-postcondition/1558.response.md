To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the program's variables based on the initial state.

Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is defined as `2 + dx`, `ny` is defined as `2 + dy`

The code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` accesses the element of the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are based on the expressions defined in the initial state:

- `nx = 2 + dx`
- `ny = 2 + dy`

However, without specific values for `dx` and `dy`, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, we can represent them as expressions based on `dx` and `dy`.

Since none of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, or `A` have their values changed, we will include all valid information about the state. The output will reflect that `ncur` has been assigned a value from the array `A` based on `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`**
