Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1`, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the queue now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the state of the variables.***
