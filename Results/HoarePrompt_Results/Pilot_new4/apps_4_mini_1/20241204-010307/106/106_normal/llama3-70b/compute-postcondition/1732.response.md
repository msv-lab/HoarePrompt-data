Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
