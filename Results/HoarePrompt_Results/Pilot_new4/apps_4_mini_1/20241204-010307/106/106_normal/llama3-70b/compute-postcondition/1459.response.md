Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid; `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell; `queue` contains tuples of cells added for processing based on valid moves. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
