The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the existing list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the `queue`, but the other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains one element `[(cur, n + 1)]` and now also contains `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` is less than or equal to `n`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
