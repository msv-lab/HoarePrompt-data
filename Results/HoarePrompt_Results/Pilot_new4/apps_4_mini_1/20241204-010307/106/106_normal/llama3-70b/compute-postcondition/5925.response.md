Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid moves `(nx, ny)` that were within bounds, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of the previous indices leading to each `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid moves `(ncur, 1)` for each update made during the iterations, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition that 0 ≤ `nx` < `N` and 0 ≤ `ny` < `N`.***
