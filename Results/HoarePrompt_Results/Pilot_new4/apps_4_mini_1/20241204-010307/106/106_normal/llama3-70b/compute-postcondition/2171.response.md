The variables `nx` and `ny` will be assigned the new values based on the current values of `x` and `y` along with the values from the tuple `(dx, dy)`, where `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0. Therefore, `nx` becomes `x + 1` and `ny` becomes `y + 0` (which is simply `y`). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`.**
