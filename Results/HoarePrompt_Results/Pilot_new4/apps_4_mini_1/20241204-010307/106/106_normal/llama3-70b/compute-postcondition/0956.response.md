According to the code, the loop will iterate over the list of directional changes specified by `dx` and `dy`. Each iteration will assign a different pair of changes to `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10, indicating that it is a valid size for any operations dependent on `N`.
- `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, which are the current coordinates being considered.
- `nx` is -1 and `ny` is 0, which are derived from the first tuple in the list of directional changes `(-1, 0)`.

For the next iteration:
1. The first iteration of the loop will have already assigned `dx` as -1 and `dy` as 0. 
2. The second iteration will then assign `dx` as 1 and `dy` as 0.
3. The next pair for the third iteration will be `dx` as 0 and `dy` as -1.
4. Finally, the fourth iteration will assign `dx` as 0 and `dy` as 1.

Since we are currently at the first tuple of the list `(-1, 0)`, we need the state variables adjusted for the upcoming iteration. 

So, at the start of the next iteration, `dx` will now be 1 and `dy` will be 0. The calculations for `nx` and `ny` will be:
- For the second iteration: `nx` would be `x + dx` = `0 + 1` = `1`, and `ny` would be `y + dy` = `1 + 0` = `1`.

This results in `nx` being 1 and `ny` being 1, which are both within the valid range of `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, assuming `N` is at least 2.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1**
