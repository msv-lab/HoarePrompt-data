The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the entry in `dist` are not affected by this assignment, so they remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the new assignment.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 8, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][8]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
