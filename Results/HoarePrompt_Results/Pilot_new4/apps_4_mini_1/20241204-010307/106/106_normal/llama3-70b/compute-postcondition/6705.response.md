In the provided code snippet, the operation involves appending a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged in terms of their values; only the `queue` variable is affected.

The values of `ncur` and `1` are being added as a tuple to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and since `nx` is equal to `1 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, it will hold its respective value based on the array `A` and indices `nx` and `ny`.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
