Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1). If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `(ncur, 1)` has been appended to `queue`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.***
