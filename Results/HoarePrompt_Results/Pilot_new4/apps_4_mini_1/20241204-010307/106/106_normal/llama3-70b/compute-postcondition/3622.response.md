Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` must be valid, `ncur` is updated for valid moves. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
