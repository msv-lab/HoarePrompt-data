Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `nx` is `x + dx` where `dx` is within bounds; `ny` is `y + dy` where `dy` is within bounds; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `piece` is 1, and the distance from the first piece to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the first piece to `cur` plus 1.***
