The code updates the `dist` array at the index `[2][ncur]`, where `ncur` is derived from the initial state. The value assigned to `dist[2][ncur]` is the current value of `dist[2][cur]` incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `dist[2][cur]` is not specified, so we denote it as `dist[2][cur]` for clarity. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
