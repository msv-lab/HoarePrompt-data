Let's analyze the code snippet and its impact based on the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `N` is between 4 and 10
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 2
- `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`

The line of code provided is:
```
parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece
```

### Step-by-Step Impact:
- This line assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and also relates to a variable `piece`, which isn't defined in the initial state. However, it indicates that another value is being set alongside `cur` in some context.
- The values of `ncur`, `parent`, and `cur` are directly affected:
  - `ncur` is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`, which are dependent on `dx` and `dy`. However, these variables are unspecified in the initial state.
  - The assignment does not alter the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, or `dist`, but updates `parent[0][ncur]` with the current value of `cur`.

### Conclusion:
The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and the relationship with `cur` remain unchanged, except for the assignment of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
