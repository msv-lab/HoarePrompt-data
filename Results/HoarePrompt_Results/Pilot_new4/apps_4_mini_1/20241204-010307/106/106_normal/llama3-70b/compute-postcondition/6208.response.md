Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][0]`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`.***
