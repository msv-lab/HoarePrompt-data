Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` may contain tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for all reachable `ncur` from the initial position `(0, 0)`, based on conditions involving `piece`, `dist[1][ncur]`, and `dist[1][cur]`. If the loop does not execute, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
