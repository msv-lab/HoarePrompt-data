The `queue` variable, which is likely a list or similar structure, is updated by appending a tuple containing the values `(ncur, 1)`. The other variables' states remain unchanged. The specific values of `ncur` and `1` are added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is set to 1; `x` is at least 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][3]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
