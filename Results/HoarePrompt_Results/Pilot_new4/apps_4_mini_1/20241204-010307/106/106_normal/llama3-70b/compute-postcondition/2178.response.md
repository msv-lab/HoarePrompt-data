According to the code, the loop iterates over four possible directions defined by the pairs (dx, dy). The loop will continue to execute for each direction until all directions have been processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, `piece` is 2, and `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`. The loop has processed one direction, so it needs to process the next direction from the list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. 

Since there are a total of four pairs, and assuming this was the first iteration, the next pair will be processed. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider that the loop variable `(dx, dy)` will take the next values in the list. If the current iteration is for `(-1, 0)`, then the next values will be `(1, 0)` in the second iteration, followed subsequently by `(0, -1)` and then `(0, 1)`.

Since we are not given specific information about which iteration we are on, we can generalize the concept to assume that we are moving to the next direction in the list.

State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, and the next direction `(dx, dy)` is `(1, 0)`**
