The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added to the `queue`, but the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
