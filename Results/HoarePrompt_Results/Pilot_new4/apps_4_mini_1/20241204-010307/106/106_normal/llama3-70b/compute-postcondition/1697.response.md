To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions dependent on the variables involved.

1. **Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over the pairs `(dx, dy)` from the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. This means that the loop will always execute four times regardless of the state of other variables.

2. **State Variables**:
   - `N` is between 3 and 10, which is valid for the loop execution.
   - `y` is initialized to 1, which is a valid starting point.
   - `dx` and `dy` are chosen from specified sets, affecting the calculations for `nx` and `ny`.
   - The key calculations for `nx` and `ny` are `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. 

3. **Bounds Checking**: The conditions for `ncur` being valid are:
   - `0 <= nx < N`
   - `0 <= ny < N`
   Since `y` is 1, the values of `ny` must also be valid. We need to ensure that after the adjustments from `dx` and `dy`, `nx` and `ny` remain within the bounds defined by `N`.

4. **Valid Combinations of `dx` and `dy`**:
   - For each pair `(dx, dy)`, determine if `nx` and `ny` remain valid:
     - For `(-1, -1)`: `nx = x - 1`, `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`
     - For `(-1, 1)`: `nx = x - 1`, `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - For `(1, -1)`: `nx = x + 1`, `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`
     - For `(1, 1)`: `nx = x + 1`, `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

5. **Ensuring Valid `ncur`**: After performing the above calculations, we need to ensure that for at least one valid combination of `(dx, dy)`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the array `A` which is `N x N`.

6. **Summarizing the Adjustments**: 
   - The variable `x` must be chosen such that `x - 1` and `x + 1` remain valid indices for the calculations of `nx`.
   - For `ny` to be valid, `1 - 1` must be 0 and `1 + 1` must be 2, which are already valid if `N >= 3`.

Thus, for the loop to execute with valid `ncur`, we need to ensure that:
- `x` is within the range `[1, N-2]` to guarantee valid `nx` values when `dx` is -1 and +1, ensuring `nx` does not exceed the bounds of `N`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }**
