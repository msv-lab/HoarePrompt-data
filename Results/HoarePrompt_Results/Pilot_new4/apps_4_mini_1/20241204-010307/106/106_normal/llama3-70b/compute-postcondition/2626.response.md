Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances from `cur` to each valid `ncur` position for all reachable positions, `parent[2][ncur]` indicates the parent positions and pieces leading to each `ncur`, and `queue` contains all reachable tuples `(ncur, 2)` for valid positions after all iterations of the loop have completed. If the loop does not execute, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
