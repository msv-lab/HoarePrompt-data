Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, and if `nx` and `ny` are within the valid range of `0` to `N-1`, then `ncur` is set to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to the variables.***
