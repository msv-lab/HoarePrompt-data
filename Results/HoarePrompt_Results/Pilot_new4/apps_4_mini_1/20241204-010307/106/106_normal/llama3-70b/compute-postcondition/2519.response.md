The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. The current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, so this assignment will update `dist[2][ncur]` to a new value that is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `piece` remain unchanged, while `dist[2][ncur]` is updated.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`**.
