The `queue` variable is modified by appending a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` to it. The values of `ncur` and the integer `1` are added to the existing `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`; `queue` now includes the element `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`; `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
