The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state, but we assume they have been assigned values somewhere previously in the code. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, 1, 3, or 4, `ny` is 0, 2, or 3, `ncur` is assigned the value from A[nx][ny], `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1, parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
