Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.***
