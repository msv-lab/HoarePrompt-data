The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but since `x` must be greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `nx` will be greater than `1 + dx` and less than `N - 1 + dx`. Similarly, `ny` will be `y + dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` must be greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` must be greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`.**
