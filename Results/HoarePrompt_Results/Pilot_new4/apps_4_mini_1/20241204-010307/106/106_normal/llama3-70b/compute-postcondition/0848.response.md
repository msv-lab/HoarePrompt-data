The `queue` variable will have a new tuple appended to it, consisting of the current value of `ncur` and the integer `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[0][0]`, the appended tuple will have specific values based on the state of `A[0][0]`. However, the exact value is not provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 0; `dx` is not applicable; `dy` is not applicable; `ncur` is equal to `A[0][0]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
