The line of code updates the `dist` array at the position `[2][ncur]`. Initially, `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. We know that `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `cur` remains unchanged. 

Since `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the current value of `dist[2][cur]`, we must acknowledge that the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, while the values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
