Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, the `queue` now contains the additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`. The values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.***
