The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a new tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the existing `queue`. This operation does not affect other variables; instead, it modifies the `queue` by adding a new element based on the current values of `ncur` and `piece` (which is equal to 2).

The previous state of the program indicates that `ncur` holds the value `A[nx][ny]`, which must be valid due to the previous context, and thus is within the bounds determined by `N`. The `queue` now includes an additional tuple reflecting the current state regarding `ncur`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples including `parent[2][ncur]` which is now `(cur, 2)`, `queue` contains valid tuples and now includes `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`.**
