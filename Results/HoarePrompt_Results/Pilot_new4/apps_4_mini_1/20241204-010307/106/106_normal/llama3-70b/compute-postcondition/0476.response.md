Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0]` is in a state that allows updates based on valid moves, `parent[0]` is in a state that reflects potential connections, `queue` contains tuples of nodes that will be manipulated according to the loop's execution, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = 2 + dy`, `ncur = A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The current value of `piece` is 1, and it holds true that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
