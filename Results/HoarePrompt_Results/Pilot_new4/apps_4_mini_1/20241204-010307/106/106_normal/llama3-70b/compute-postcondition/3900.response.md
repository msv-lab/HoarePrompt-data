The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so they remain unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values for `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables (`N`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`**
