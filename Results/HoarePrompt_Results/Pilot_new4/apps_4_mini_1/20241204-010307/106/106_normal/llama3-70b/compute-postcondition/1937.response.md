The line of code `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the indices `[0][ncur]`. The initial state provides context that `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices, and since `piece` is unchanged, it remains 0.

The output state now reflects that `parent[0][ncur]` has been updated to contain the values of `cur` and 0, but we do not know the specific value of `cur` from the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent` now has `parent[0][ncur] = cur`, `piece` is unchanged and remains 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[0][ncur]` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now `cur`, `piece` is unchanged and remains 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
