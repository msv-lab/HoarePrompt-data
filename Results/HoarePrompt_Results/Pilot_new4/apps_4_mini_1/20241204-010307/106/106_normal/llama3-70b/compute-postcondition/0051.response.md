`ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]**
