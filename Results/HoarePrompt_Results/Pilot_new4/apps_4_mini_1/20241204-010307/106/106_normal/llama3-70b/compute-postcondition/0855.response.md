Since `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is equal to `dy`, the value of `ncur` will now depend on the specific elements in the 2D array `A` at indices `(dx, dy)`. The initial states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for all valid moves, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N-1` (i.e., `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`); `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`.**
