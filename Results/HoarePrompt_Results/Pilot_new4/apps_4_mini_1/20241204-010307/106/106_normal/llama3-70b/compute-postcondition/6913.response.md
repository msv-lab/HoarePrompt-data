Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from `cur` to each reachable cell based on the given conditions, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the previous cell and piece for each reachable cell, and `queue` contains the tuple `(cur, i)` along with any previous tuples; if no cells were reachable, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
