The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the position `[0][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy` for each pair (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1); `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy` for each pair (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1); `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
