Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1), `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1
```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```
Now, please think step by step: 

The code assigns `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are both -1, which means `nx` will be equal to `x - 1` and `ny` will be equal to `y - 1`. 

The variable `N` remains unchanged as there are no operations affecting it. The `queue` also remains unchanged since there are no operations affecting it. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1), `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`.**
