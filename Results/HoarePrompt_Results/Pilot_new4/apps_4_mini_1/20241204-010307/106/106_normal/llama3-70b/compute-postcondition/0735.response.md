Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 + dy`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid positions reachable based on the original `x` and `y`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the predecessor positions in the path, `queue` contains all reachable positions `(ncur, 0)` where `piece` equals 0 and valid updates occurred. The current values satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
