The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` paired with the variable `piece`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` are not directly affected by this assignment, meaning they retain their initial conditions. The output state reflects the assignment made to `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` paired with `piece`.**
