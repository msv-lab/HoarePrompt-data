According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. The loop will execute for each tuple in this list. Therefore, the loop is executed a number of times equal to the length of this list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last tuple in the list. The last iteration of the loop would correspond to the index of the last tuple in the list, which is 3 (for the tuple `(1, 1)`).

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to acknowledge that there are no more tuples in the list after the last one. Thus, there will not be any adjustments to `dx` and `dy` as the loop will not execute again.

Thus, since the loop has completed all its iterations (there are no additional tuples left), we can conclude:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` remains unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged.**
