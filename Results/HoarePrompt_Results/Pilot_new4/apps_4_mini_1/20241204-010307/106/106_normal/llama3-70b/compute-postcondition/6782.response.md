The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, it will depend on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The initial state remains valid but updates the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `piece` is the same, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` is unchanged, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
