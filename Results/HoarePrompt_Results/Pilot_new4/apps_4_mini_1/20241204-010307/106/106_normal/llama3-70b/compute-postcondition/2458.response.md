Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, and if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances calculated from `cur` for all valid `ncur` reached from `(x, y)`; `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the previous state leading to `ncur` for all valid `ncur`, and the tuple `(cur, i)` is appended to `queue`. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
