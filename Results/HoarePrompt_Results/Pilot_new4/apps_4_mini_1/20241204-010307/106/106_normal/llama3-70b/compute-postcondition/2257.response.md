To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code within the context of the initial state. 

Initial State: `piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0)

The code snippet assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` using the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. However, there are no initial values provided for `x` and `y`, which makes it impossible to calculate specific numeric values for `nx` and `ny`. 

Since we don't have the actual initial values of `x` and `y`, we can state that `nx` will depend on `x` (specifically, `nx = x + 1`) and `ny` will depend on `y` (specifically, `ny = y + 0`, which simplifies to `ny = y`).

Thus, after executing the given code, the output state retains all the information of the precondition except for the newly calculated values of `nx` and `ny`. 

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0), `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`**
