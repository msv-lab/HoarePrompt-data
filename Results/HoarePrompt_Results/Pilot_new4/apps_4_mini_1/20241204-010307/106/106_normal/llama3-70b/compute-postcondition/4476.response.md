Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
