The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` now includes the new tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples and now also includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
