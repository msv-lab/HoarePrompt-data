Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, there are no changes made to the variables.***
