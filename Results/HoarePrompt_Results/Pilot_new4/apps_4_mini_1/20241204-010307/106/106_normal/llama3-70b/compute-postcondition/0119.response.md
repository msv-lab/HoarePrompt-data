The code snippet updates the distance from a current position (`cur`) to a new position (`ncur`). The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Since `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` and `ny` are both constrained between 0 and `N` (exclusive), we can conclude that `ncur` is an integer value that is determined at runtime based on the values in the array `A`. Additionally, `dist[0][cur]` represents the current distance to the position indexed by `cur`. 

The impact of the code is that it assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`, which is one unit greater than the current distance at position `cur`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), `piece` equals 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
