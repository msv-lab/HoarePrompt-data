In this code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The variables `x` and `y` have specific values: `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so their exact influence on `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined. Therefore, `nx` becomes `1 + dx` and `ny` becomes `0 + dy`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`.**
