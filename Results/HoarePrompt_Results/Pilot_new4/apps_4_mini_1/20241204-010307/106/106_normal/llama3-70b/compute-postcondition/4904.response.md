The code appends the tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, which does not directly affect the `queue` operation, but the loop's execution has implications for `dist`, `parent`, and the other variables mentioned. The state of `dist` and `parent` remains unchanged as they are not modified by this operation. The variable `piece` is not equal to `i`, which suggests that the appending operation is valid under the current conditions. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `dist[2]` may have been updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution; `parent[2]` contains the parent positions corresponding to the updated `dist[2]`; `queue` now contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` positions and the appended tuple `(cur, i)`; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
