Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
