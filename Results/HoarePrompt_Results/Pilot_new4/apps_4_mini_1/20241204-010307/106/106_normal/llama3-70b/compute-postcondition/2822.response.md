The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The variable `queue` is now updated to include this new tuple, but the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
