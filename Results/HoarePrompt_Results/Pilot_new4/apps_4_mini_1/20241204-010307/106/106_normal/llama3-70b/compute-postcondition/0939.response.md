The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, with `dx` and `dy` representing the increments in the x and y directions respectively. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, and that `dx` and `dy` are not specified but are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program.

The values of `nx` and `ny` can be calculated as follows:
- `nx = x + dx`, therefore, `nx = 0 + dx`.
- `ny = y + dy`, therefore, `ny = 1 + dy`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as this code only affects `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`**.
