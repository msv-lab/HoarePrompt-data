Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `piece`; the queue now contains `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
