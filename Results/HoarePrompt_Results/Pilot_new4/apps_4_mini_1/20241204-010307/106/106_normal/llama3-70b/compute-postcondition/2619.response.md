To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the effects on the variables involved.

1. `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`.
2. `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`.

From the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, which means `y < N - 1`.
- `dx` must be either `0` or `1`.
- `dy` must be either `0` or `1`.

Since `dx` and `dy` can take the values `0` or `1`, the resulting values for `nx` and `ny` will depend on their specific values.

However, we know that:
- If `dx = 0`, then `nx = x + 0 = x`.
- If `dx = 1`, then `nx = x + 1`.
- If `dy = 0`, then `ny = y + 0 = y`.
- If `dy = 1`, then `ny = y + 1`.

The value of `y` is less than `N - 1`, and since `dy` is either `0` or `1`, `ny` could be either `y` or `y + 1`, still remaining valid given `y < N - 1`.

Therefore, the output state maintains all original information while updating the variables affected:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `dx` must be (0, 1), `dy` must be (0, 1), `nx` is either `x` or `x + 1`, `ny` is either `y` or `y + 1`.**
