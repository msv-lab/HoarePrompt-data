The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is computed as `x + dx`, which equals `0 + (-1)`, resulting in `nx = -1`. Similarly, `ny` is computed as `y + dy`, which equals `-1 + 1`, resulting in `ny = 0`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
