The code snippet `cur, piece = queue.popleft()` modifies the values of `cur` and `piece` by assigning them the first elements from the `queue` after removing that element. The variables `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are not directly modified, but the value of `queue` changes as its first element is removed.

After executing the code:
- `cur` will hold the first element of `queue` (which represents the current position of the processed piece).
- `piece` will hold the type of the last processed piece, also derived from the first element of `queue`.

The state of `queue` has been altered as its first element has been removed, but we donâ€™t know the specifics of the first element, so we cannot provide a specific value for `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the minimum distances from the original position to all reachable positions based on piece types, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `cur` is the first element from the previous `queue`, `piece` is the type of the last processed piece from the previous `queue`, and the first element has been removed from `queue`.**
