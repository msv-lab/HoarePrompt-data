The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)` and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
