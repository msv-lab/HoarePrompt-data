Postcondition: ***If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2]` is updated with the minimum distances for valid moves, `parent[2]` reflects the previous valid positions for those updates, and `queue` contains an additional entry `(cur, i)`. If `piece` equals `i`, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
