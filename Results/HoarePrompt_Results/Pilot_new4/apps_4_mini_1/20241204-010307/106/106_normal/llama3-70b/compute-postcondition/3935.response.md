Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2. After all iterations of the loop, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the shortest distances for valid positions that could be reached from the starting position `(x, y)` based on the piece type being 2, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the parent references for those positions, and `queue` contains all valid positions that were appended during the loop execution. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no valid moves were possible, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their states before the loop.***
