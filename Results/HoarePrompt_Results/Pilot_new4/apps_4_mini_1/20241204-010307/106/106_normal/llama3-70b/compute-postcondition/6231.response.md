The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are used directly in this operation, while the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `queue` is expected to be a list that holds the appended tuple.

The output state reflects that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` has been updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`. Now, the `queue` has the tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**
