The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` along with `piece`. The state of the variables `cur`, `ncur`, and `piece` is now reflected in the `parent` array. Since `parent[0][ncur]` is being set to `cur`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
