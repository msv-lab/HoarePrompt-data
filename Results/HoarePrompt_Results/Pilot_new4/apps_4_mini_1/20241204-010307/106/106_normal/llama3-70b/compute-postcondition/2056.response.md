The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of the element at the position `(nx, ny)` in the array `A`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` are `x - 1` and `y - 1`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `N` is at least 5, and other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
