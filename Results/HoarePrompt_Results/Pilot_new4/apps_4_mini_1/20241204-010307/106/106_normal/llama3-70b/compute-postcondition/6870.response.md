The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The specific values of `cur` and `ncur` are not provided, but since `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`, the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` will be `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The other variables (N, piece, parent, queue, dx, dy, nx, ny, A) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set as needed, `queue` contains the necessary elements if updates occur, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 1), `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
