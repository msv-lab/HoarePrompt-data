The code updates `dist[0][ncur]` to be the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The previous value of `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but we don't have the specific values of `cur`, `dist[0][cur]`, and `A[nx][ny]`. Therefore, we can state that `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, while the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
