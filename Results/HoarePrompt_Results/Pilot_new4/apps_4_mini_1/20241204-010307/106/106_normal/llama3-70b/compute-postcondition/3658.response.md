The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are not defined, `nx` and `ny` will also be undefined. As such, the output state reflects that `nx` and `ny` are not defined, while retaining the existing states of `N`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is not defined, `ny` is not defined**
