The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are included in the tuple, but no other variables are affected or changed by this operation. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`.**
