Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy` and `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
