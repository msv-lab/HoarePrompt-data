The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The value of `ncur` is determined to be equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`. The initial state provides that `N` is between 4 and 10, and the values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are also defined. Since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, we do not know its value, but we can express the new state based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1.**
