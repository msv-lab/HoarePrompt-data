According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs `(dx, dy)` from the list of offsets `[( -1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. During each iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the next pair in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -1 for the first iteration. The next pair in the list, which will be used in the next iteration, is `(-1, 1)`. 

The loop will execute again as long as there are more pairs in the list to iterate over. Currently, there are 4 pairs in total, and since the last iteration corresponds to the first pair, the next pair will be the second one.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
