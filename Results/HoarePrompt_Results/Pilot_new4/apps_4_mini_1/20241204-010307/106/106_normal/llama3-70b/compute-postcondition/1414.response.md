Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, 1, 3, or 4, `ny` is 0, 2, or 3, and `ncur` is assigned the value from A[nx][ny]. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.***
