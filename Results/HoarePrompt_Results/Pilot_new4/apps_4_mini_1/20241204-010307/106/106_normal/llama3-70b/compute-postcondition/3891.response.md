To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to analyze the loop's control variable and the data structures involved.

The loop iterates over the tuples in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, which contains 4 pairs of values. The loop will iterate over each pair of `(dx, dy)` one by one.

At the end of the last iteration, we are currently working on the second tuple (1, -1) or potentially the third tuple (1, 1) depending on how the iteration was functioning. However, we do not have information about which tuple was used at the end of the previous iteration in this case. 

Given that the loop body is omitted, we can assume that the for loop will execute one more time unless we've reached the end of the iterable.

In any case, the loop should advance to the next tuple after the current one. Since the list contains 4 tuples, and for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the index of the tuple is less than 4.

Assuming we were on the second tuple (1, -1) in the last iteration, the next tuple would be (1, 1). If we were on the third tuple (1, 1) in the last iteration, the next tuple would be out of bounds, thus ending the loop.

So, if we consider the state must reflect the next tuple in order to execute again, we conclude:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then on the next iteration the loop will use the next tuple, which will be the last tuple if previously it was the third. The next tuple is (1, 1) leading to `nx` and `ny` being updated accordingly.** 

However, since we don't know the current tuple, we represent it as the next tuple to be used in the iteration.

Thus, the state can be represented as:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + 1`, `ny` is `2 + 1`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]` (with the next tuple being (1, 1))**.
