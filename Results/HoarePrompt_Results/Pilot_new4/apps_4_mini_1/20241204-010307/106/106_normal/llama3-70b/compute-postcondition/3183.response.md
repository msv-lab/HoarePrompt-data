The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are used directly as they are in the tuple. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, and the specific values for `ncur` are not provided, but the tuple will still be formed with the current value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -2, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
