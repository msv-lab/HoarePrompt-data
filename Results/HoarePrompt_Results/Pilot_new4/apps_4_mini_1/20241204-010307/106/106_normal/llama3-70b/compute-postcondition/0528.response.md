Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[2]` reflects the updated minimum distances after checking all valid moves, `parent[2]` contains the updated connections for valid moves corresponding to the final state of `dist[2]`, `queue` includes the tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
