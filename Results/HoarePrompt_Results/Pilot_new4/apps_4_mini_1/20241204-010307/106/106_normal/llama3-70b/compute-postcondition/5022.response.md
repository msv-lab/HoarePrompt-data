Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `nx` is `3 + dx`, and `ny` is `dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
