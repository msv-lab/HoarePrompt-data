`nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is 2 and the value of `y` is also 2. The exact values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified, but they can be reset to iterate. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `2 + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `2 + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, `queue` are in a valid state, `dx` and `dy` can be reset to iterate over the tuples again, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`.**
