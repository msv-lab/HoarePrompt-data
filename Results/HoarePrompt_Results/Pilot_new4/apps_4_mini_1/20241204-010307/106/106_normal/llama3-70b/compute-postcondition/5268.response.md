According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterations over the pairs `(dx, dy)`. The current state indicates that `x` is 4, which is the starting index for the `dx` and `dy` pairs. The pairs provided represent offsets that will be applied to `x` and `y` respectively. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` are taken from the current index of the loop. The loop will execute for each pair in the list, starting from index 0. Since `x` is currently 4 and `y` is 0, the loop will execute an additional time for the next pair.

The pairs in the list are indexed from 0 to 7, and currently, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the first element in the list. Therefore, in the next iteration, the index will be incremented to 1, corresponding to the second pair `(-2, 1)`.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `4 + (-2)`, `ny` is equal to `0 + 1`, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made.**
