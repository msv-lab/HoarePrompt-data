The assignment `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[1][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and since `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` will reference the value at the matrix `A` at the indices `(x - 1, y - 1)`. 

The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, but since the assignment involves `dist[1][cur]`, we will treat it as an unknown value since its specific value does not affect the output.

The important aspect is that `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be one more than the current value at `dist[1][cur]`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `dist[1][ncur]` is now set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, but without knowing the value of `cur`, we cannot express a numerical value for `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
