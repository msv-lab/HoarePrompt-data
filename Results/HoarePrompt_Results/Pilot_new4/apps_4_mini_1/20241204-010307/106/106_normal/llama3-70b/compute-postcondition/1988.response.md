The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are already specified to be within the bounds of the grid, meaning that `A[nx][ny]` is a valid access operation. As such, `ncur` will hold the value found in the 2D array `A` at the specified indices.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices; `piece` is 1; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
