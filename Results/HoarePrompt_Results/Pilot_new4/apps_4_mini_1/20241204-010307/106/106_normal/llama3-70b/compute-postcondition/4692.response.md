Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not met, no actions are taken.***
