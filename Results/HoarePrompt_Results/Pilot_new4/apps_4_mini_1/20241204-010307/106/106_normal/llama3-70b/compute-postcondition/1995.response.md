According to the code, the loop iterates over the directions specified by the tuples in the list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. There are a total of 4 iterations for this loop, corresponding to each direction. At the end of the last iteration, `piece` is 2. 

Since no specific index is mentioned for the iterations of the loop in the information provided, we can infer that the loop will start with the first direction and proceed to the next on each iteration.

To execute one more time, we need to consider that the loop has executed for each direction. If we assume that the loop has iterated through all four directions, after the fourth iteration, the next iteration would attempt to access the fifth direction, which does not exist.

Therefore, to adjust for the next state of the variables, we still need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time for the last direction in the list. Since there are no changes made in the loop body, the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, and `piece` is still 2.**
