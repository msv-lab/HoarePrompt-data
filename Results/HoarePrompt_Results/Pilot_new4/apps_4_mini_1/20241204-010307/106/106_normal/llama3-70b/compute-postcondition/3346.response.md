The code snippet updates the `parent[0][ncur]` variable to be a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece`. The initial values for `cur` and `piece` are unchanged. The other variables in the initial state remain valid and unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, `queue` may contain new tuples based on the conditions, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
