The code snippet updates the `dist` array at the position `[0][ncur]` by adding 1 to the current value at `dist[0][cur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The important aspect to note is the new value of `dist[0][ncur]`, which will now reflect the increment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of A[x - 4][0], and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
