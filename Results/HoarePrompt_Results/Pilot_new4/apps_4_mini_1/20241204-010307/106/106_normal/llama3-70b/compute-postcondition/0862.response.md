According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction tuples `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, which means it has 4 iterations in total. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of `0` to `N-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, both `dx` and `dy` would need to take on the next direction tuple in the list.

If the loop was just executed for the last direction `(0, 1)`, the next direction to be processed would be `(-1, 0)`, and the values of `dx` and `dy` would be updated accordingly. If the current iteration index is at the last direction, the loop will not execute again.

However, since we reach the end of the loop, we need to prepare for the next iteration, which means we cannot actually execute the loop again; therefore, we need to reflect on the index for the next loop:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
