To determine the conditions under which the for loop will execute, we need to analyze the components involved in the loop statement.

The for loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy) for dx in [-1, 1] for dy in [-1, 1]]`. This means it will iterate through four pairs of `(dx, dy)`: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. 

Given the states before the loop starts:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 0
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reached from `(x, y)`
- `parent[0][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` reached
- `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` for valid `ncur` values

The important aspect for the loop to execute is that the list of tuples `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]` is not contingent on any other variable. It will always contain these four pairs regardless of the state of other variables. Therefore, the for loop will always execute.

However, the impact of the loop on other variables (like `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) is determined by the logic within the loop body, which is omitted in this case. Given the provided state information, we can conclude that the loop will execute without needing further adjustments to `N`, `y`, or other variables.

Thus, the states that need to be acknowledged are primarily about the context rather than adjustments, as the loop execution does not depend on them.

In conclusion:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` will be updated based on the loop body, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs**.
