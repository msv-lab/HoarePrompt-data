The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the indices `[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided, so we cannot determine their specific values, but they will be stored in `parent[1][ncur]`. The states of other variables are not affected during this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
