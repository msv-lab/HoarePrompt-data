The code `cur, piece = queue.popleft()` extracts the first tuple from the `queue`, which removes that tuple from `queue`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are assigned the values from that tuple. Since the contents of the `queue` are unspecified, the specific values of `cur` and `piece` are unknown, but we can infer that `queue` will now contain one less tuple. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dist` contains the minimum distances from `cur` to all reachable positions for each piece type, `parent` holds the predecessor tuples for all reachable positions corresponding to their respective piece states, `queue` contains one less valid tuple, `cur` and `piece` are assigned values from the tuple that was on the front of the `queue`.**
