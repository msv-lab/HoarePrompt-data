In the given code, `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The value of `dist[0][cur]` is increased by 1 and assigned to `dist[0][ncur]`. The other variables retain their previous states.

The output state reflects that `N` remains at least 4, `piece` is determined by the loop conditions, `y` remains 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, but we now also have a new value for the `dist` array.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains determined by the loop conditions, `y` is still 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
