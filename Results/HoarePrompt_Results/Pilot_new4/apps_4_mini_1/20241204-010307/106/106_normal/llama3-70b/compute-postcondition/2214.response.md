The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, and also assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. Since `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, it suggests that `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the value of `cur`. The previous state of `parent` reflects that the parent of `ncur` is updated to `cur`, indicating a relationship in the graph or tree structure represented by the `parent` array. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `queue` contains two elements `[(cur, n + 1), (ncur, 0)]`, `nx` is now `x + dx`, `ny` is now `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, piece is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, now processing the second pair `(-2, 1)`**
