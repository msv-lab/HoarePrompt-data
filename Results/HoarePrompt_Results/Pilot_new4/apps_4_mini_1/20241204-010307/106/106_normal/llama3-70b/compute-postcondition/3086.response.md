According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing possible movements in a 2D grid defined by `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the current values of `dx` and `dy` will change according to the next tuple in the list. The current value of `dx` and `dy` is `(2, 1)` from the last iteration (the last tuple in the list). Therefore, on the next iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the first tuple in the list, which is `(-2, -1)`. 

The loop will execute for all tuples in the list one by one. Since the loop already made it through the last tuple `(2, 1)`, and the loop will run until all tuples have been processed, the next `dx` and `dy` pair will be `(-2, -1)` for the upcoming iteration. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ny` is 3; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`.**
