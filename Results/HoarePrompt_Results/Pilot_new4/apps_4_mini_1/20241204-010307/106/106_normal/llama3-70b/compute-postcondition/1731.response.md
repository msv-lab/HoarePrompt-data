The `queue` variable is modified by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `2`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged, as they do not get modified by the code snippet provided. Other variables that were mentioned in the initial state are not affected either. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the tuple to the `queue`, while keeping all other variables as they were.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
