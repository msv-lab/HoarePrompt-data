The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. This indicates that the `parent[2][ncur]` variable is now updated to hold these values. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `dist[2][cur]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 1 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is not greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`**.
