Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, and if `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `queue` contains an additional entry `(cur, i)`, otherwise `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their previous state.***
