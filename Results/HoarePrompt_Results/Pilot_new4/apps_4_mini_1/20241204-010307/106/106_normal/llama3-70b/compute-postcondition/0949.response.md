In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state or the provided code. Therefore, without values for `dx` and `dy`, we cannot determine the new values of `nx` and `ny`. 

As a result, the values of `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged as their new values depend on undefined variables. The initial conditions for `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` still hold, but we cannot update `nx` and `ny` specifically without knowing `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` must be -1, `ny` must be 0, `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged due to undefined `dx` and `dy`.**
