The code assigns values to `parent[1][ncur]` with the values of `cur` and `piece`. The variables `parent[1]` will now include the new assignment for the specific index `ncur`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is either -1 or 1; `ny` is either 0, 2, or both based on the combinations of `dx` and `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
