Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` are valid, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` entries, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
