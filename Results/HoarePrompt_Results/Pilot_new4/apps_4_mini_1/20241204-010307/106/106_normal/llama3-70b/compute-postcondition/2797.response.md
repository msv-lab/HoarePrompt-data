The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `cur` is a variable whose value is not explicitly mentioned but is used in the assignment, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][y + 1]`. The other state variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][y + 1]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
