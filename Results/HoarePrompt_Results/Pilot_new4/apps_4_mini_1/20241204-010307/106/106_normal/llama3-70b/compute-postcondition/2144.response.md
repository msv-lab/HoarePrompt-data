The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variables `x` and `y` represent the current coordinates, while `dx` and `dy` represent the increments to be applied to these coordinates. The Output State will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny` while maintaining the valid distance information in `dist` and the initialization of `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is initialized for valid `ncur`, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `y + dy`.**
