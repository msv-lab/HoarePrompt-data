Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1) after all possible moves have been considered, `parent[0]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1) after the loop execution, and `queue` contains tuples of all valid positions that had their distances updated during the loop execution. If no valid positions were reachable, `dist[0]` remains unchanged from its initial state, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
