The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, and `nx` and `ny` are defined in terms of `x`, `dx`, and `y`, `dy`. Since all pairs `(dx, dy)` have been processed, the values for `dx` and `dy` are now fixed after the loop completion.

Thus, `nx` is now equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is now equal to `0 + dy`, which simplifies to `dy`. The values of `N` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`.**
