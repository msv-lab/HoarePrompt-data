The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` are not changed by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of A[x - 4][0], `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
