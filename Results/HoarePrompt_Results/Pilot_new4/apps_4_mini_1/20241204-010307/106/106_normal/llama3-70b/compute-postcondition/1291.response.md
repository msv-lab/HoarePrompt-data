The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the indices `[2][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and the state of `dist` remain unchanged from their previous definitions, as the code does not modify them directly. Therefore, we only need to note the assignment performed.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which is no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)`.**
