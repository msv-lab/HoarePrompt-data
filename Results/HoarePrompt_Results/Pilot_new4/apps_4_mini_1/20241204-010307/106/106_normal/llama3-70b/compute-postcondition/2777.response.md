Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates the predecessors of each position in the path, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values which can be empty if no positions are reachable, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` indicating that `(nx, ny)` is within the bounds of the grid.***
