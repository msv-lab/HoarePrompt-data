The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`. The value assigned is the current value of `dist[1][cur]` incremented by 1. The precondition indicates that `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact change in `dist[1][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `ncur` will affect only the index of the `dist` array that is updated, but we do not have specific information about the values in `A` or `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
