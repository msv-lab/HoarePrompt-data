The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which is based on the current values of `nx` and `ny`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and their previous values are still valid. The `queue` list is now updated with a new entry. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now a combination of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`**.
