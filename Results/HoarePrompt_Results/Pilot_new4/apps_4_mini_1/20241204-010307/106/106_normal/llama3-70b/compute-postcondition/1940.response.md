Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now `cur`, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the condition is not met, there are no changes to `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, or `queue`.***
