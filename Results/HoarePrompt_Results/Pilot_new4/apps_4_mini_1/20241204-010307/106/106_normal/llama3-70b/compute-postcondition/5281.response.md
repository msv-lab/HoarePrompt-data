The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur`, `0`, and the `queue` are affected by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, but `queue` was not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `queue` now contains a new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
