The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + 1` and `y`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` takes the value of the element in array `A` at the position `(x + 1, y)`. The states of the other variables, including `dist`, `cur`, and `piece`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `cur` is the current position, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`.**
