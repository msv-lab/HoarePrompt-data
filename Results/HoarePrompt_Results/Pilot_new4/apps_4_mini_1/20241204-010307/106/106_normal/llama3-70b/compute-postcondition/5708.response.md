The code assigns the value of `cur` to the `parent[0][ncur]` variable along with `piece`. There are no changes to the values of `N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, or `dist` as a result of this assignment. The output state will reflect the assignment made without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`**.
