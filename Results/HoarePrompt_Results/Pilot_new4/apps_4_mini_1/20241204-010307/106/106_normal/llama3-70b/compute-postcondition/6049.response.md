The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is determined from the array `A` at the coordinates `(nx, ny)`, which are valid indices based on the preconditions. The variable `cur` corresponds to the value of `A[x][y]`, and since `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the relationship holds after the assignment. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and the previous relationship holds.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
