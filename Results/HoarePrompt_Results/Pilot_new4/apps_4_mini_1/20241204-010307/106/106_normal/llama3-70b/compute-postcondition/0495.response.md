Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][3]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
