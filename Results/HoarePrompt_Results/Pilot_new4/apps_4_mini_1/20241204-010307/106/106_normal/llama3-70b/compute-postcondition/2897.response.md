Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations, `x` is `N`, `nx` is equal to `N + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, where `N + dx` is between 0 and N-1 and `0 + dy` is between 0 and N-1 for all (dx, dy).**
