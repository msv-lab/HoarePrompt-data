The code updates the distance array at the given indices. The calculation involves incrementing the value at `dist[1][ncur]` by 1, adding it to the current distance `dist[1][cur]`. The specific values of `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` are not known, but they are updated based on the operation performed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
