The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. Since no information is given about the specific values of `cur` and `piece`, we cannot determine their values directly. However, we note that `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, which may have been impacted by previous operations, but that impact isn't specified in this context. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` is not empty; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
