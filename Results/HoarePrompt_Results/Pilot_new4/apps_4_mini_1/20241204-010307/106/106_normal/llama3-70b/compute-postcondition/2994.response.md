`ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 2` and `ny` is `0`. The value of `nx` is calculated based on the value of `x`, and since `N` can range from `3` to `10`, we do not know the specific value of `x`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, `ncur` will depend on the two-dimensional array `A` at the position corresponding to `nx` and `ny`, while the other variables maintain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x - 2][0]`.**
