In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, and `y`, `dy`. 

- The value of `dx` is 0, and the value of `dy` is -1. 
- Therefore, `nx` becomes `x + 0`, which simplifies to `x`, and `ny` becomes `2 - 1`, which equals `1`.

Thus, the updated values are:
- `nx = x`
- `ny = 1`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][2]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated; `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1**.
