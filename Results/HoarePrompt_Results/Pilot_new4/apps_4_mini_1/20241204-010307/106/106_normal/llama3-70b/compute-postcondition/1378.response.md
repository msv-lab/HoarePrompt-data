Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances updated based on valid moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding previous positions for reachable states; `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves; `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 2; and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
