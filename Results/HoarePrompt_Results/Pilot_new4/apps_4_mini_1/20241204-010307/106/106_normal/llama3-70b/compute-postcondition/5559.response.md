According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which consists of four pairs. During each iteration, the variables `dx` and `dy` take on the values of these tuples sequentially. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed one of those pairs. Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, it will continue to execute until all pairs have been utilized. 

Since `dx` and `dy` are updated in each iteration of the loop, after the last iteration completes, the next values for `dx` and `dy` will depend on the current iteration index. At the beginning of the next iteration, the loop will be on the second pair. Thus, for the loop to execute again, it will use the next pair of values.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1**
