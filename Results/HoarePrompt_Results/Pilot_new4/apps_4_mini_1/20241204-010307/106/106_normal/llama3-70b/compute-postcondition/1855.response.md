According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the directional changes `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute as long as there are more tuples in the list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, we are currently processing the first tuple `(-2, -1)`, corresponding to the values of `dx` and `dy`.

The loop will execute one more time for the next tuple in the list. Since the list contains 8 tuples (representing 8 directions), and we are currently at the first one, after this iteration, we will move to the second tuple.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the `dx` and `dy` values will be updated to the next tuple in the list, which is `(-2, 1)`.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + (-2)`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, if both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the distance to reach `ncur` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now `cur` with the value of `piece` when `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1**.
