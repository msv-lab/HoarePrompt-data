The code updates the `dist` array at the position `[2][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, and `cur` is known to be `A[2][0]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unaffected.

Thus, the updated state reflects that `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `dist` is updated at [2][ncur] to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`.**
