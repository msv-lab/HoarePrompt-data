The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged, and no other computations or assignments are made in the provided code snippet. Therefore, `queue` is updated with a new element, while all other variables retain their previous state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ny` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
