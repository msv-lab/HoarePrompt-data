Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur` that was reachable from `cur` with `piece` equal to 1; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur` reached; `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples generated during the loop iterations; the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged.**
