The code snippet updates the `dist` array at the index `[2][ncur]` based on the value at `dist[2][cur]`. Specifically, the value at `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. However, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated.

Here's the breakdown:
- `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 
- The values of `dist[2][cur]` and `cur` are not specified, but `dist[2][ncur]` is now one greater than whatever `dist[2][cur]` was.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `dist[2][ncur]` while maintaining the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is `2 or 3`; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
