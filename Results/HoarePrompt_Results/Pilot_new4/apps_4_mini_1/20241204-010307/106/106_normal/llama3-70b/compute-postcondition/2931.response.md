Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
