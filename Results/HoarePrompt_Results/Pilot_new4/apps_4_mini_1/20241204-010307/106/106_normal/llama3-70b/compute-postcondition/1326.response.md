The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the `parent` array at position `[0][ncur]` is being set to a tuple comprising `cur` and `piece`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are known, and they are updated in the `parent` array.

Since `piece` is initially 0, the assignment means `parent[0][ncur]` will store the values of `cur` and 0 as a tuple. This does not affect any other variables.

Here is the updated state based on the execution:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains all reachable tuples, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, an error occurs as `A[0][-1]` is out of bounds, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
