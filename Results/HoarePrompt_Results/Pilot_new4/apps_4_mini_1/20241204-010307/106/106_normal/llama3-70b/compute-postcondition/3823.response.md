The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, where `dx` and `dy` represent a change in the `x` and `y` coordinates based on one of the four possible movement directions. The initial states of `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` holds tuples for positions added during the loop, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` holds tuples for positions added during the loop, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
