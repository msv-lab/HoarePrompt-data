According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`. Each iteration modifies `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` based on the conditions related to `piece`, `dist[1][ncur]`, and `dist[1][cur]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, and `piece` is equal to 1. This means that the conditions have been evaluated, but we need to consider how the loop's state will change for the next iteration.

The loop will execute one more time for the next direction tuple in the list, which means we need to adjust to the next index in the list of directions. Since there are 4 tuples in the list, the current index should be incremented by 1 after the last iteration.

State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 1, current index in directions is 1 (for the tuple `(-1, 1)`)**
