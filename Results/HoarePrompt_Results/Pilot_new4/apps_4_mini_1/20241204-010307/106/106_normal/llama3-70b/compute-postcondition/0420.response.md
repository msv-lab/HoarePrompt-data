The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` do not change as a result of this operation, but the `queue` variable will now contain an additional element, which is the tuple. The other variables remain unaffected. 

The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is the current value of `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains an additional element `(ncur, 2)`.**
