The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. Given that `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N-1, `A[nx][ny]` can be accessed without any out-of-bounds issues. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
