According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list of directions `[(dx, dy)]`. The loop iterates over this list, and since it contains four tuples representing possible directional movements, the loop will always execute its body four times regardless of the values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`. 

Since the loop is not dependent on these states for execution, there is no need to adjust the states related to `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. The variables `dx` and `dy` will simply take the values from the tuples during each iteration. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is updated based on the reachable cells from (x, y), `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable cell, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous cell and piece for each reachable cell, `queue` contains tuples of all reachable cells along with their corresponding piece value, (dx, dy) will take values from the list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
