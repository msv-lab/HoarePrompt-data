Since `nx` is defined as `x + 1` and `ny` is defined as `y - 1`, the value of `ncur` is assigned from the 2D array `A` at the position corresponding to the values of `nx` and `ny`. However, the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, meaning we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, `ncur` will simply be `A[nx][ny]` based on the latest values of `nx` and `ny`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is A[nx][ny].

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is A[nx][ny].**
