Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is `x - 1`, `x + 1`, or `x`, `ny` is `1`, `2`, or `3`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated where conditions are met, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all tuples of updated `ncur` values with `1`, `dx` and `dy` are defined as the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. The current value of `nx` is within the range [0, N) and the current value of `ny` is within the range [0, N).***
