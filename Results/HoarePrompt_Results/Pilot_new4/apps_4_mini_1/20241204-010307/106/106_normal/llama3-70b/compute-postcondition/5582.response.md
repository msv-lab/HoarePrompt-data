In the provided code snippet, we are updating the `parent` array at index `[2][ncur]` to hold a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `piece`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, and there are several other variables and arrays with specific relationships.

Here's the breakdown of the impact:
- The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, where `piece` is 2 and `cur` retains its previous value from the context of the execution. 
- Other variables such as `dist`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `A[0][0]`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Since the only change is to `parent[2][ncur]`, we will include this updated information in our output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples; values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1; parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`.**
