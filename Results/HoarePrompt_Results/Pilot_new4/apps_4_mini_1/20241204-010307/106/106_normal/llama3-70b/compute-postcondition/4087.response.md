The values `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and `dx`, `dy`. Here, `x` is 0, and `y` is 1. The values of `dx` and `dy` can take on one of the four pairs in the provided list. The new values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on which pair of `(dx, dy)` is chosen for that specific iteration.

Since `dx` and `dy` can take values from the set [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], we can analyze the potential new values of `nx` and `ny`:

1. If `dx = -1` and `dy = 0`, then:
   - `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`
   - `ny = 1 + 0 = 1`
   
2. If `dx = 1` and `dy = 0`, then:
   - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - `ny = 1 + 0 = 1`
   
3. If `dx = 0` and `dy = -1`, then:
   - `nx = 0 + 0 = 0`
   - `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   
4. If `dx = 0` and `dy = 1`, then:
   - `nx = 0 + 0 = 0`
   - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

Since the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine exact values for `nx` and `ny`. However, we can state that they are dependent on the combinations of `dx` and `dy`.

The output will therefore include the possible new values for `nx` and `ny` based on the possible combinations of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is one of [-1, 1, 0, 0], `ny` is one of [1, 1, 0, 2] depending on the values of `dx` and `dy`.**
