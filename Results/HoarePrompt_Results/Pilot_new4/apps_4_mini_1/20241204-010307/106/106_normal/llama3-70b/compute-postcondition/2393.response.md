The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, without knowing the values of `dx` and `dy`, we can only express `nx` and `ny` in terms of those variables.

The initial state provided is:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 0
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`
- `nx` is equal to `x + 2`
- `ny` is equal to `1`

After the code executes:
- `nx` will be updated to `x + dx`
- `ny` will be updated to `0 + dy` (since `y` is 0)

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated variables `nx` and `ny`:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`**.
