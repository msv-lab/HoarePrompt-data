Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, and `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then the queue is updated to include the new tuple `(A[3][0], 2)`, `dist[2][ncur]` remains equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `ncur` remains equal to `A[3][0]`.***
