The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous values of `parent[1][ncur]` are not known, but after executing the code, `parent[1][ncur]` will reflect the current move from `cur` with the respective `piece`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y + 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, the next `(dx, dy)` pair being processed is `(1, 1)`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.**
