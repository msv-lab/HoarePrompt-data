The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. Given the initial state, `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]`, and `2` is a constant. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The variable `queue` is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is 5; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]; `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
