In the code snippet provided, the line `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value in the `dist` array at position `[0][ncur]`. 

To analyze the impact:
- The variable `cur` represents the current position in the `dist` array, and `ncur` is derived from `A[-2][1]`. 
- The value at `dist[0][ncur]` is set to the value at `dist[0][cur]` plus 1. This means that `dist[0][ncur]` will be incremented based on the current distance at `cur`.

Because we do not have specific values for `cur` and `ncur`, we use these variables directly in the output. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `A[0][0]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
