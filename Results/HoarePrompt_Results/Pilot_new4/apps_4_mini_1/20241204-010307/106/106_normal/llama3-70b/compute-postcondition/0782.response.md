The code is assigning a value to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous state indicates that `ncur` was assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, which is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`. The variable `cur` retains its prior value from the preconditions. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is `2 or 3`; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
