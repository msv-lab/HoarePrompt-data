The code updates the `dist` array at the position `[0][ncur]` by adding 1 to the value at the position `[0][cur]`. The variables that are affected and the calculations involved are as follows:

- `ncur` remains unchanged as it is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and this value will be used to determine `dist[0][ncur]`. 
- We do not have the specific values of `cur` or `dist[0][cur]`, but the state of `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated based on `dist[0][cur]`.

The output state remains consistent with the existing values of the variables, except for `dist[0][ncur]`, which will now be `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`; `ny` is equal to `N + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
