The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value at the first index of the `dist` list based on the current index `cur`. The other variables' values remain unchanged. The impact of the code means that the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Since `ncur` is already defined as `A[dx][dy]`, we will use that in our output state.

Assuming `cur` has a value (which we don't have specific information about), `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated accordingly. However, as the specific values of `dist`, `cur`, and `ncur` are not provided, we will express the output state as much as we can based on the impact of the operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
