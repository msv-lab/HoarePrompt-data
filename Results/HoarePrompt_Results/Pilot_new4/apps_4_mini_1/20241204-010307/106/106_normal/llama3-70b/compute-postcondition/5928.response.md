The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given the preconditions, we know that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, meaning that the new value for `dist[2][ncur]` will still be greater than `dist[2][cur]` after this update. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid moves `(nx, ny)` that were within bounds; `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of the previous indices leading to each `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid moves `(ncur, 1)` for each update made during the iterations; `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and is greater than `dist[2][cur]`.**
