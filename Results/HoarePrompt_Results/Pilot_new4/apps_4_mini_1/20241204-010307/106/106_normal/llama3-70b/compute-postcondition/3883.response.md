Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The current value of `nx` is between 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N) and the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N).***
