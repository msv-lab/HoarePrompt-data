Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 2)` where valid moves were possible, `piece` remains unchanged, and if the loop did not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
