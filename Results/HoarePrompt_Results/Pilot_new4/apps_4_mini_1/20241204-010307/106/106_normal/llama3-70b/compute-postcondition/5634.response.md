Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` may contain multiple elements as a result of appending `(ncur, 0)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is the final value computed from `x + dx` for the last iteration; `ny` is the final value computed from `y + dy` for the last iteration; `ncur` is the last computed value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`. If no valid position was found for any iteration, `queue` remains unchanged, and `dist` and `parent` would not have updated entries for `ncur`.**
