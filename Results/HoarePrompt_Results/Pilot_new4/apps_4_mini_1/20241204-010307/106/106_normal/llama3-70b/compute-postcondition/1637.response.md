Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur` based on valid knight moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells; `queue` contains all reachable cells and their corresponding pieces that were added during the loop iterations. If the loop did not execute, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
