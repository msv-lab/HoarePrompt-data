Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and now also (ncur, 1). If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`.***
