Postcondition: ***`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.***
