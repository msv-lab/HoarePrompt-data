The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The constraint states that `N` must be an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`. The values of `A` remain unchanged since the code focuses only on updating `N`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, and `A` is a 2D list of distinct integers satisfying 1 <= A[i][j] <= N^2 for all valid indices i and j; `N` is an input integer.**
