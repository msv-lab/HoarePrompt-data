The `nx` variable is calculated as `x + dx`, and the `ny` variable is calculated as `y + dy`. Given the initial values, `x` is 0 and `dx` is 1, so `nx` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`. Similarly, `y` is 2 and `dy` is -2, so `ny` becomes `2 + (-2) = 0`.

The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions pertaining to `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `queue` remain untouched based on the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value, `piece` remains 0, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` remains 0, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`.**
