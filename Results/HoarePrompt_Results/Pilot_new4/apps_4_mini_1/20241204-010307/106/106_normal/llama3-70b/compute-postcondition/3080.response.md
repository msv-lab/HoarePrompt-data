To determine the output state, we need to analyze the assignment `ncur = A[nx][ny]`. 

1. The initial state provides that `nx` is equal to `x + 2`. However, the exact value of `x` is not given. Therefore, `nx` is not explicitly defined until we know the value of `x`.
2. The variable `ny` is given as `3`.
3. Thus, regardless of the specific value of `x`, `ny` contributes a clear definition to `ncur` as it is part of the assignment.
4. The code assigns the value from a 2D array `A` at the coordinates `[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. This means `ncur` takes on whatever value is stored in that position in the array `A`.

The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `ny`, and `nx` do not change their definitions. However, the value of `ncur` becomes specifically `A[nx][3]`.

Given that `nx` is dependent on the unknown `x`, we can't articulate a specific numerical value for `ncur` without that information. Therefore, we will leave it as an expression.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][3]`.**
