Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` is empty, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N - 1 inclusive.***
