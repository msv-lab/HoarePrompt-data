Postcondition: ***`dist[2]` is updated with the minimum distances for valid moves, `parent[2]` reflects the previous valid positions for those updates, `queue` contains the valid `ncur` movements for piece 2, while `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged if no valid moves were made. Additionally, the value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
