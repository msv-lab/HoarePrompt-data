Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`, where `ncur` equals `A[nx][ny]`. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
