The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the specified indices. The values of `cur` and `piece` do not change, but the value at `parent[1][ncur]` is now a tuple containing both `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is (cur, piece)**.
