Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `piece` is 1; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `piece` is updated; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
