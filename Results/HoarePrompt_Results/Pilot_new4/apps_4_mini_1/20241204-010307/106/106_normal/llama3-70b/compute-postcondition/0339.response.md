The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are given as `x - 1` and `0`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will take the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `[x - 1][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`.**
