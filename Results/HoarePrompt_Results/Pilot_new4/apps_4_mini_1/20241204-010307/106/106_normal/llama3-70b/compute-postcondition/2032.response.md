The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the list `queue`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the earlier state, which has not changed, and the value `0` is a literal integer. Other variables remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances, where `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` now contains (cur, i), (ncur, 0), and (ncur, 0); `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`.**
