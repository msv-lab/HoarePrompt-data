The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer 1 to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` holds the value of `A[1][1]`, but since this value is not specified in the initial state, we cannot specify it in the output. 

The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged conditions along with the new addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `ncur` is `A[1][1]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple (`ncur`, 1) has been appended to `queue`.**
