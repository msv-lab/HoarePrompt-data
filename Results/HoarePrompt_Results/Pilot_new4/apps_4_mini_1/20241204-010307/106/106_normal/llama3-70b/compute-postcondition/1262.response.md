Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is the same as before, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions based on conditions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken for those updated positions, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions that met the conditions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
