According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute as long as `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is set to `y + 1`, and since `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, we can assume `y` has been incremented by 1.

Thus, if `y` was the final y-coordinate before incrementing, after the increment, `y` will be `y + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y + 1` must be less than `N`. Therefore, the new value of `y` will be `y + 1`, and we need to ensure that `N` is greater than `y + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the final y-coordinate which is now `y + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors of each reachable position with their corresponding piece values, and `queue` contains the previous tuples of reachable positions with piece value 2 plus the new tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged, and `N` must be greater than `y + 1`.**
