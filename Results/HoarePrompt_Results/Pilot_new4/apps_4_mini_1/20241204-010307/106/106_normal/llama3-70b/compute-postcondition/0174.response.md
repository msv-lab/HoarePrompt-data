The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` remain unchanged, and the state of other variables is retained as is. The conditions regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain valid after this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
