In this code snippet, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The initial state indicates that `x` is 0 and `y` is 0. Since `dx` and `dy` are not applicable, we can assume that they default to 0. 

Thus:
- For `nx`: 
  - `nx = x + dx = 0 + 0 = 0`
- For `ny`: 
  - `ny = y + dy = 0 + 0 = 0`

The values of `nx` and `ny` both remain 0 after the execution.

None of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`) are affected, so we retain their original states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 0; `dx` is not applicable; `dy` is not applicable; the loop has processed all tuples.**
