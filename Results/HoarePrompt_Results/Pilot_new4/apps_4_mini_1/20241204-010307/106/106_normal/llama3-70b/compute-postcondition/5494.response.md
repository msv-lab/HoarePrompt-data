According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on these direction tuples, affecting their values. 

At the end of the last iteration: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` can be 3, 5, or 4, and `ny` can be 1, 2, or 3. Before the next iteration of the loop, the values of `nx` and `ny` will be calculated based on the current `(dx, dy)` values from the list.

In the first iteration, the values are:
1. For `dx = -1` and `dy = 0`, the new `nx` will be `x + dx = 4 - 1 = 3` and `ny` will be `2 + 0 = 2`.
2. For `dx = 1` and `dy = 0`, the new `nx` will be `4 + 1 = 5` and `ny` will remain `2`.
3. For `dx = 0` and `dy = -1`, the new `nx` will be `4 + 0 = 4` and `ny` will be `2 - 1 = 1`.
4. For `dx = 0` and `dy = 1`, the new `nx` will be `4 + 0 = 4` and `ny` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `nx` and `ny` fall within the bounds of `N` (0 ≤ nx < N and 0 ≤ ny < N). 

Since `N` is between 4 and 10, let's summarize the possible values:
- From the first iteration `(dx = -1)` gives `nx = 3` and `ny = 2` (valid).
- From the second iteration `(dx = 1)` gives `nx = 5` and `ny = 2` (valid).
- From the third iteration `(dx = 0, dy = -1)` gives `nx = 4` and `ny = 1` (valid).
- From the fourth iteration `(dx = 0, dy = 1)` gives `nx = 4` and `ny = 3` (valid).

Since all the derived states from the current `(dx, dy)` pairs are valid, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `nx` and `ny` must correspond to the next direction tuple.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` can be 3, 4, or 5, `ny` can be 1, 2, or 3.**
