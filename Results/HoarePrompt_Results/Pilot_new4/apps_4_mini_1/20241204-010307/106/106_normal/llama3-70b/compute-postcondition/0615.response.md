Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2]` is updated with the minimum distances from `cur` to all reachable positions for piece 2, `parent[2]` tracks the previous position and piece for each reachable position for piece 2, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` tuples added during the loop execution. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no conditions are satisfied for any iteration, `dist[2]` remains unchanged, `parent[2]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains empty.***
