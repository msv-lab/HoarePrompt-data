Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, and `queue` now contains three elements `[(cur, n + 1), (ncur, 0), (ncur, 0)]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are set to `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The second pair `(-2, 1)` is now being processed when `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true.***
