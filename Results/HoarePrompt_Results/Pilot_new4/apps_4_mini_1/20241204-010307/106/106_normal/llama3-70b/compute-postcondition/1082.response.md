The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous values of `ncur` and `queue` are not provided; thus, we can only describe the change that occurs in the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[0][ncur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
