The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of the `queue` containing the new tuple but doesn't modify any of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; and `dist[0][cur]` is less than `dist[0][ncur] - 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
