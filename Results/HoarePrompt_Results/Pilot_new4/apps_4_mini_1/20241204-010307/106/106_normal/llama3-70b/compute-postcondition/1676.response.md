The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are already defined in the initial state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`**.
