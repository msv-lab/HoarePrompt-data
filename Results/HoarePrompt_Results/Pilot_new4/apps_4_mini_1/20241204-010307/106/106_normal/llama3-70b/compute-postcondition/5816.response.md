The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)`. Since `piece` is currently 1, the assignment results in `parent[1][ncur]` being updated to `(cur, 1)`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to the `parent` array while retaining all other conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`; `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is not assigned a valid value due to out-of-bounds access; the current value of `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, 1)`.**
