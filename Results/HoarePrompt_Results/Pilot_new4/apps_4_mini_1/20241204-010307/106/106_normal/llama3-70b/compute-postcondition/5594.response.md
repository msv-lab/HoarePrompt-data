According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible directions represented by the tuples in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `nx`, `ny`, and `piece` are involved in the conditionals that determine if any changes are made to `parent`, and if `(ncur, 2)` is included in `queue`.

Since the loop iterates over each tuple `(dx, dy)` in the list, after the last iteration, it has completed an iteration for one of the direction tuples. Therefore, we need to adjust the values of `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration.

If the last iteration was for the first direction `(-1, 0)`, then the next iteration will be for `(1, 0)`, followed by `(0, -1)` and then `(0, 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, since there are no specific values provided for `dx` and `dy`, I will assume that the loop could continue to execute as long as there are more tuples left in the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`; `piece` is 2; the next (dx, dy) will be (1, 0)**
