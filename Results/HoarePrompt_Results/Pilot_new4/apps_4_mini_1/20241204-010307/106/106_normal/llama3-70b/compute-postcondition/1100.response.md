The line of code updates the `parent` array at index `[1][ncur]` with the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, except for `piece` being 1. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, we cannot know the exact value of `parent[1][ncur]` after the assignment without knowing `cur` and the value of `ncur`.

However, we can conclude that `parent[1][ncur]` will contain the tuple `(cur, 1)` after executing the code. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dist` remains unchanged except for `dist[1][ncur]` updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent` updated at `[1][ncur]` to `(cur, 1)`; `queue` remains unchanged; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]**
