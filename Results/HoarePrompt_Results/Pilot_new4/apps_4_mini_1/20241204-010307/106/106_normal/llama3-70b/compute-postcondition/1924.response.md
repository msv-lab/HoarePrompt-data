Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4 and `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains a tuple of `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
