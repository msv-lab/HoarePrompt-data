The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. Since `cur` and `i` are defined in the context of the code but their specific values are not provided in the initial state, we understand that `cur` is a current position and `i` is an index related to the context. The `queue` will now contain additional valid moves represented by the newly appended tuple. 

The other variables (`dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged in terms of their current states except for `queue`, which is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dist[2]` is updated for all reachable `ncur` indices from the initial position; `parent[2]` contains tuples of previous indices; `queue` now contains additional tuple `(cur, i)`; the value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
