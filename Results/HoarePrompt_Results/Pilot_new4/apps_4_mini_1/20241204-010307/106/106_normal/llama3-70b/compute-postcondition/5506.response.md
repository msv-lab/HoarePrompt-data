The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are undetermined in the initial state, but `ncur` is specified as `A[5][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `parent[2][ncur]`, while retaining all other existing variable information.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 5; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is A[5][2]; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, piece)**
