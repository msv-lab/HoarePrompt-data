The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but they are part of the output state. The `queue` variable is updated with the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
