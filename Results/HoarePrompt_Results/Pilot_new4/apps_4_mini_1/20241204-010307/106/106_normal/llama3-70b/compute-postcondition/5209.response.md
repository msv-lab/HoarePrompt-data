The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which means it holds the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The code updates `dist[1][ncur]` to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`. This indicates that the value at `dist[1][ncur]` is incremented by 1 based on the current distance value at `dist[1][cur]`. The variables `dist`, `cur`, and `ncur` are impacted, while the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
