`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Since `x` and `y` are both within `0` and `N-1`, and `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction in the list, the specific values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction in the list; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
