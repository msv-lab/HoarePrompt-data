Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, and `piece` is 1. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.***
