The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The initial state gives specific ranges and conditions for `N`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, these expressions are valid and calculate the coordinates within the bounds of the array `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`**
