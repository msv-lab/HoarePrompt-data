Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices. If `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `parent[0][ncur]` is set to the value of `cur`, `piece` is set to 0, the `queue` now includes the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 0)`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. If `nx` and `ny` are out of bounds, no changes are made to the variables.***
