Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next tuple in the list of movement directions; `i` is less than 8; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
