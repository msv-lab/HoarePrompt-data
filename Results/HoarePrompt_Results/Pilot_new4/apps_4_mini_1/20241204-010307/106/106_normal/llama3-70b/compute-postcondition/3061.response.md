Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, no modifications are made to the variables.***
