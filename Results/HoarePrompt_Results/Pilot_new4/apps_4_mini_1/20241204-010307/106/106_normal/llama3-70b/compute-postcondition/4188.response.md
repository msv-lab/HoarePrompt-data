Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[dx][2 + dy]`, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`, and `queue` has appended `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
