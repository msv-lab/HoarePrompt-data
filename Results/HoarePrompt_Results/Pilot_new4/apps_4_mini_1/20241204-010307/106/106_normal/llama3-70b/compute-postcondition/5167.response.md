Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent` contains valid parent tuples for those positions, `queue` includes the tuple `(cur, i)`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` for all valid updates. If no valid positions were reachable, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `piece` is equal to `i`, the state remains unchanged.***
