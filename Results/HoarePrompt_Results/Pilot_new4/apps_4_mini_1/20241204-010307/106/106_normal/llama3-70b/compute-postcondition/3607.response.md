The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. The preconditions about `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` still hold, but now the `parent` variable is updated.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
