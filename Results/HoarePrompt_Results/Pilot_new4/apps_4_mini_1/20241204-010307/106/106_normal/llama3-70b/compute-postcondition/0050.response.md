The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, but `dx` and `dy` must be defined based on the context of their previous evaluations in the completed loop. The output state does not affect `N`, `piece`, and the values of `dist` since they remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny` based on this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`**
