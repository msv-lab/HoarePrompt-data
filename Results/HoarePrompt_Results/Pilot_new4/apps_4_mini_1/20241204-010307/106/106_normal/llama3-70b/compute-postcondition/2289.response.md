The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the provided expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` were `x + (-2)` and `y + 1`, respectively. The specific new values will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `y` remains `N`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`.**
