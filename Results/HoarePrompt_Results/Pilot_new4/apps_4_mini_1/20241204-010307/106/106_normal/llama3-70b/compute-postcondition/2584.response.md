The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the given expressions. The new values are calculated by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`. The values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, but the conditions for `nx` and `ny` still hold true after the update. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
