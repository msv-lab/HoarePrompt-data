Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, and `y` is equal to `N`. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position based on valid moves for piece 2, `parent[2]` contains the parent pointers corresponding to the updated distances for piece 2, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains all previously reachable states plus the new state `(cur, i)`. If `piece` equals `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
