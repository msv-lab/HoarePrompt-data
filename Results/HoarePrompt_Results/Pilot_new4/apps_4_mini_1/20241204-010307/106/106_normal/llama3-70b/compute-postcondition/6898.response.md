The code assigns the tuple (cur, piece) to the position [2][ncur] in the parent array. The previous state does not change the values of `N`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, or `dist` directly. However, it establishes a relationship in the `parent` array based on the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 1][y]`, the value at `parent[2][ncur]` will now reference the current state of `cur` and `piece`. 

Thus, the output state reflects these updates while maintaining the previous values of the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, piece)**.
