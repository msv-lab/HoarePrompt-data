The line of code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` results in updating the `dist` array at the index `[1][ncur]` to be equal to the value at `dist[1][cur]` plus 1. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10.
- `y` is 2.
- `piece` is 1.
- `x` is at least 1.
- `nx` is `x + dx`.
- `ny` is `2 + dy`.
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
- The condition `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` is valid prior to the assignment.

The specific update occurs where `dist[1][ncur]` is set to the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which modifies the `dist` array accordingly.

Since no other variables are affected and the previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` will now be `dist[1][cur] + 1`, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
