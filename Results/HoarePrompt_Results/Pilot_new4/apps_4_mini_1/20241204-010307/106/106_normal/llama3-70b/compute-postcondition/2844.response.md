According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directions `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute four times in total, once for each direction. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have processed one of the directions. 

Given that `piece` is equal to `1`, and assuming the loop has already processed the first direction (for example, `(-1, -1)`), it is necessary for the loop to move to the next direction in the list. The state updates would not depend on changes to `N`, `dist`, or `parent` variables because those values are not modified during the loop iterations themselves based on the provided context.

Thus, if the loop has iterated through one of the four directions, the next value of `(dx, dy)` will be processed in the next iteration. Therefore, we can determine that the state must be tracked for the next iteration.

Assuming the loop has processed the first direction and is now at the second direction, which would be `(-1, 1)`:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, (dx, dy) is (-1, 1)**
