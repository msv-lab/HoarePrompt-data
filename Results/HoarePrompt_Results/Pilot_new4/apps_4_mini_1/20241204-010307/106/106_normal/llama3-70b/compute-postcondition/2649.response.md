The code assigns a value to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`. We do not know the previous values of `parent` or `piece`, and the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur and piece`.**
