Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, and `parent[1]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains an additional tuple `(cur, i)`. If no valid moves were made, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged from their initial state, while `queue` may be empty or contain previously valid tuples.***
