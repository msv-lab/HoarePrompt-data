The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The preconditions state that the value of `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which means the new value must now be equal to that expression. 

Since `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, after the assignment, we must note that the previous condition is no longer valid. 

The other variables retain their previous states, which remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, 1, 3, or 4, `ny` is 0, 2, or 3, `ncur` is assigned the value from A[nx][ny], `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, 1, 3, or 4, `ny` is 0, 2, or 3, `ncur` is assigned the value from A[nx][ny], `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
