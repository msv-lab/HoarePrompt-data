The code snippet appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but the state of the `queue` is updated to include the new tuple.

The previous values of the variables are:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- `nx` is `1 + dx`
- `ny` is `2 + dy`
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]` 
- `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`

After executing the code, the new condition related to `queue` is that it now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
