The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` by adding the current values of `x` and `y` to `dx` and `dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` will be taken from the provided list of tuples. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples: [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]

This means for each tuple `(dx, dy)` from the list, we can compute corresponding `nx` and `ny`.

1. For `dx = -2`, `dy = -1`: 
   - `nx = 2 + (-2) = 0`
   - `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   
2. For `dx = -2`, `dy = 1`: 
   - `nx = 2 + (-2) = 0`
   - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

3. For `dx = -1`, `dy = -2`: 
   - `nx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
   - `ny = 1 + (-2) = -1`

4. For `dx = -1`, `dy = 2`: 
   - `nx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
   - `ny = 1 + 2 = 3`

5. For `dx = 1`, `dy = -2`: 
   - `nx = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `ny = 1 + (-2) = -1`

6. For `dx = 1`, `dy = 2`: 
   - `nx = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `ny = 1 + 2 = 3`

7. For `dx = 2`, `dy = -1`: 
   - `nx = 2 + 2 = 4`
   - `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`

8. For `dx = 2`, `dy = 1`: 
   - `nx = 2 + 2 = 4`
   - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the specific tuple chosen from the list. The initial state of `N`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged, while `nx` and `ny` will take on values based on the selected `(dx, dy)` tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the selected tuple `(dx, dy)` from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]**.
