Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-1][0]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
