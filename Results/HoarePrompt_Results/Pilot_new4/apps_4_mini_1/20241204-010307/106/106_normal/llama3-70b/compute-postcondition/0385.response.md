Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` and `dy` take on each of the values from the list of tuples throughout the loop, resulting in all valid positions `nx` and `ny` being evaluated. If the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are met, then `dist[0][ncur]` may be updated accordingly based on the distance from the current position, and `parent[0][ncur]` will reflect the last piece and current position. The `queue` will contain tuples of valid positions. If no valid moves were found, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
