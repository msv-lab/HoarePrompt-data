The `queue` is updated by appending a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `2`. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
