The code `cur, piece = queue.popleft()` pops the leftmost tuple from the `queue`, assigning the first element of the tuple to `cur` and the second element to `piece`. The previous values of `queue` will change accordingly after the operation. The variable `N` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation, and the contents of `dist` and `parent` are also unaffected.

If `queue` initially contained a tuple of the form (1, i), after executing the code, `cur` will be assigned the value `1` and `piece` will be assigned the value `i`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions, `queue` is now the remaining elements after popping the leftmost tuple, `cur` is 1, `piece` is the value of i from the popped tuple.**
