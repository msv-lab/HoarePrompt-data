Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dist` remains unchanged except for `dist[1][ncur]` being updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `parent` is updated at `[1][ncur]` to `(cur, 1)` under the same conditions; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)` if the condition `piece == 1 and dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` holds true. Otherwise, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]` if the previously mentioned condition holds true.***
