Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `dist` is updated for all reachable positions based on conditions, `parent` reflects the paths taken for those positions, `queue` contains tuples for all updated positions that met the conditions, including the tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
