According to the code, the loop iterates over a predefined set of tuples representing possible moves (dx, dy). The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `piece` is equal to `0`. The loop does not alter `N`, `piece`, or any other state variable during its iterations; it simply processes each tuple in the list. 

Since there are 8 possible moves defined in the list, the loop will execute for each of these tuples. After the last iteration, the loop must move to the next tuple. The loop will iterate one more time for the eighth tuple, which is `(2, 1)`. The loop does not reach an end condition based on the values of `N` or `piece`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, (dx, dy) is (2, 1)**
