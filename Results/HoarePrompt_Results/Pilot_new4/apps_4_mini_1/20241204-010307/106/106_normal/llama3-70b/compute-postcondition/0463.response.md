To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to analyze the current program state at the end of the previous iteration and how the for loop's logic will affect the variables.

Given:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `nx` is equal to `x + 2`
- `ny` is equal to `3`
- `dx` is 2 (from the current iteration of the loop)
- `dy` is 1 (from the current iteration of the loop)
- The loop index is 8 (which indicates that this is the 9th iteration)

The for loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which represents different alterations to the values of `dx` and `dy`. 

Since `dx` and `dy` have been set to 2 and 1 respectively, we need to calculate the new values of `nx` and `ny` for the next iteration. The current values of `dx` and `dy` will change in the next iteration based on the next tuple in the list. 

The next values for `dx` and `dy` will be taken from the next iteration in the for loop. Since the current index is 8 and there are only 8 tuples, the loop will not execute again because it will run out of bounds.

According to the requirements for the loop to execute again, we need to check:
- If the loop is able to proceed with valid values for `nx` and `ny`.
- The next tuple does not exist because we are at the maximum index.

Thus, since there will be no next iteration of the loop and no changes made to the states, we conclude:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `3`, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, loop index cannot exceed 8**
