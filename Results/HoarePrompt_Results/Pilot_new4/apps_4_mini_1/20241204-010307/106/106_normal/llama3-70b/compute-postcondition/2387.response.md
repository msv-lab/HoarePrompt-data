The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The value of `dist[0][cur]` is not explicitly stated in the initial conditions, but it can be inferred to be some integer since it is being used in an arithmetic operation. The value of `ncur` is derived from the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`, where `nx` is `x + 2` and `ny` is `1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the existing values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is equal to `1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
