In the provided code, the statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a tuple containing the values `cur` and `piece` to the position `parent[1][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the previously initialized variable `A[nx][ny]`, but since we don't have specific values for `A`, `cur`, or `piece`, we cannot specify a numeric output for `ncur`. However, the output state will reflect that `parent[1][ncur]` has been updated with the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, `queue` contains reachable positions, `nx` is equal to 1 + `dx`, `ny` is equal to 0 + `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece)**.
