To analyze the impact of the code on the program, let's break down the assignment `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`.

1. The variable `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`.
2. The variable `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`.

Now we must consider the initial values:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- `y` is initially `1`.
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`.
- From the initial state, we have `nx = x` and `ny = 1`.

Since `dy` is not provided in the initial state, we will treat it as a variable that can take any integer value. The same applies to `dx`. Therefore, the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

After executing the code:
- `nx` becomes `x + dx`.
- `ny` becomes `1 + dy`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State reflecting the current values after execution is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
