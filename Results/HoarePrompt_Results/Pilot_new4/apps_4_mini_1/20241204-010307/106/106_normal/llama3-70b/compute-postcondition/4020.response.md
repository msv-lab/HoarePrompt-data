In the given code, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` have the following values: `nx` is 0 and `ny` is 1. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to the element in the 0th row and 1st column of the matrix `A`. 

The initial state provides no specific information about the contents of matrix `A`, so we can't determine the exact value of `ncur`. However, we know that `ncur` will be assigned the corresponding value in `A`.

The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`) remain unchanged during this operation. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]**
