Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent[0][ncur]` is set to the value of `cur`; `piece` is set to 0; `queue` includes the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current tuple for the next iteration will be (-2, 1); `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
