The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The initial conditions specify that `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`, indicating that both `nx` and `ny` are valid indices within the bounds of the 2D array `A` since they are defined to fall within the range `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.

The other variables `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged after this operation, and their constraints still hold.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2` (inclusive), `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur = A[nx][ny]`**.
