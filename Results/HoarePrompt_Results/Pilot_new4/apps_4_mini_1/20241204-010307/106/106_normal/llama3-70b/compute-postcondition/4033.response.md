`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `0 + (-2)`, resulting in `nx = -2`. Similarly, `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `1 + (-1)`, resulting in `ny = 0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, and `ny` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0**
