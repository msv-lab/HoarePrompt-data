The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -1, the calculations become `nx = x - 1` and `ny = y - 1`. 

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` and `x` must be between 1 and `N-2`, which means both `x` and `y` can take values from 1 up to `N-2`. Therefore, both `nx` and `ny` will be at least 0 and can be at most `N-3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`.**
