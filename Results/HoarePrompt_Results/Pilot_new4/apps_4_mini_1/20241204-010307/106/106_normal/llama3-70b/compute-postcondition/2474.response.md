The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of the affected variables, `cur` and `piece`, are not given, but `ncur` is determined by its previous assignment. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 2][2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`.**
