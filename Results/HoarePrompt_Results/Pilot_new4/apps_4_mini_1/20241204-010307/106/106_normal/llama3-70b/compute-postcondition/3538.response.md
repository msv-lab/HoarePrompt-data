Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is within `0` and `N-1`; `y` is within `0` and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for reachable positions based on the conditions of the loop; `parent[0][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`; `queue` contains all positions reachable by the current piece from `(x,y)` using the defined moves; `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged for any unreachable positions; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; and the current value of `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
