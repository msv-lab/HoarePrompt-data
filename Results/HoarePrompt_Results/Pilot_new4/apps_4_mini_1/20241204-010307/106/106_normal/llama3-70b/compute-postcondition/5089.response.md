The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `queue` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this line. The only change occurs in the `parent` variable, specifically at the index `[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to (cur, piece), `queue` contains previous valid tuples plus the new tuple (cur, 1), and the current value of `piece` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`.**
