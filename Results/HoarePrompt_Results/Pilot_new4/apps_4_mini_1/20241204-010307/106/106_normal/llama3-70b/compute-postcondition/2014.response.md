Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` remains 2, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains an additional entry `(cur, i)`. If `piece` equals `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their state before the loop.***
