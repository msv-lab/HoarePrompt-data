The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of the element in the array `A` at the position determined by `nx` and `ny`. The state of `nx` and `ny` is such that they are both valid indices based on the given conditions. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0]` contains the shortest distances from `(x, y)`; `parent[0]` contains the parent positions; `queue` contains potential positions to explore; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
