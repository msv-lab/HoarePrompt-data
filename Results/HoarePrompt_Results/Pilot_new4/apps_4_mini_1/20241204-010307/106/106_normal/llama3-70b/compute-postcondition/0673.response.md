Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dist[1][ncur]` holds the minimum distances from the starting position for all valid `ncur` entries, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the predecessor relationships for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` entries added during the loop execution.**
