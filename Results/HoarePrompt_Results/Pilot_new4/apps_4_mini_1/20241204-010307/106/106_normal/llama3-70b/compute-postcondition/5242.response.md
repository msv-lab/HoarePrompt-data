The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the initial values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `dx` is `-1` and `dy` is `0`, `nx` becomes `x - 1` and `ny` remains `y`. The valid ranges for `N`, `x`, and `y` are preserved, while `nx` and `ny` are specifically defined based on the calculations from `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`**
