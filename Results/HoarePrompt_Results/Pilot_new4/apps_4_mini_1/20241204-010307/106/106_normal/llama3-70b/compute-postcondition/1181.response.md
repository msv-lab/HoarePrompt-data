Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is either 0 or 2, and `ny` is either 0 or 2 depending on the values taken from `dx` and `dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to the variables.***
