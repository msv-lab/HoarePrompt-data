Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` remains 2, and `queue` contains all reachable indices with their associated pieces that were updated during the loop iterations. Additionally, the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no updates were made, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their state before the loop.***
