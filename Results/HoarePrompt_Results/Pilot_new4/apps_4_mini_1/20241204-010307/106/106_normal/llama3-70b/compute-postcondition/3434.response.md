The line of code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown: 
- The value of `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `1 + dx` and `ny` is `dy`.
- The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is set to be one more than the current value of `dist[0][cur]`.

We still have the valid preconditions:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `A[1][0]` equals `cur`
- `nx` is `1 + dx`
- `ny` is `dy`
- The previous values of `dist[0][cur]` and `dist[0][ncur]` will change as per the operation, but their specific values are not provided.

Thus, the output state reflects the change in `dist` while retaining all other variable states.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
