Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), `queue` contains the valid tuple (ncur, 2), and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
