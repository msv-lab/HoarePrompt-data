The statement `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and the constant value `2` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are the only ones directly impacted by the execution of this code. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, it retains its specific value from the previous state but is not defined here, so it is simply noted as `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is updated based on the reachable cells from (x, y); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
