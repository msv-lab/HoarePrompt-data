Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` and `piece` is 0 while `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. If the conditions are not met, there are no changes to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
