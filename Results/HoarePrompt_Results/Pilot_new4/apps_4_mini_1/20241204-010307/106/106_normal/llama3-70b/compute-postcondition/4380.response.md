The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `y` is equal to `N`, which is an integer in the range of 4 to 11. The previous values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are unknown, but `A` remains a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`.**
