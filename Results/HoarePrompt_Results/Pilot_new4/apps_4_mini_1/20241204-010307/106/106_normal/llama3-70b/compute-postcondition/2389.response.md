The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the specific values of `A`, `nx`, and `ny`.
- The other variable `queue` is not defined in the initial state but is assumed to exist as a list or similar data structure.

The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[0][ncur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged, as the operation only affects the `queue`. Therefore, the output state shows the valid information after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is equal to `1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
