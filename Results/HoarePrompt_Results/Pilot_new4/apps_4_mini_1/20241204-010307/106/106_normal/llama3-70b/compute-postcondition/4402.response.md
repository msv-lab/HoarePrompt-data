The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, except for the addition of the new entry into the `queue`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
