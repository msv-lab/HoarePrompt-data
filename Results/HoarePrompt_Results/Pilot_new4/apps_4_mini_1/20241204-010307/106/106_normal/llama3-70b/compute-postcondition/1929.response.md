Postcondition: ***Given that `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur` and `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, while `piece` remains unchanged. If the loop did not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
