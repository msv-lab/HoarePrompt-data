The code assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`, which is calculated based on the previous value of `dist[2][cur]`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` is initially greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, it indicates that `dist[2][cur]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
