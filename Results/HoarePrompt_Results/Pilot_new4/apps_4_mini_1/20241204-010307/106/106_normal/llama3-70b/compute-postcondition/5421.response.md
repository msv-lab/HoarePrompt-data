The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. Given that `ncur` is defined as `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`, the specific value of `ncur` depends on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `ncur` remains unspecified, but it is an element of the array `A`. The other variables' values are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur and piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
