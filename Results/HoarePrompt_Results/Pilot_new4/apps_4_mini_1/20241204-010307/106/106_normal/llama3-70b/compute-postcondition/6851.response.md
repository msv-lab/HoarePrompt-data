The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The previous value of `cur` is present in `A[x][y]`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The specific values of `dist[0][cur]`, `ncur`, and `dist[0][ncur]` have not been defined, but the relationship has been established.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
