Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist` is valid for reachable indices; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
