The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are directly taken from their current states, while other variables remain unchanged. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][2]`, this value is included in the tuple appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
