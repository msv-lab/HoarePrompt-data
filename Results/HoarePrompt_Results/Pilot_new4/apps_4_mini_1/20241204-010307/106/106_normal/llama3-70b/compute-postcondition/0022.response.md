To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and the provided conditions.

1. The loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent changes in coordinates (`dx`, `dy`).
2. Inside the loop, the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current coordinates and the offsets from `dx` and `dy`.
3. The conditions state that if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then certain assignments are made to `dist`, `parent`, and possibly `queue`.
4. If the condition for `piece` is satisfied, then the state of the variables may change, and in this case, `cur` is set to 1, which implies that the `parent` of the new cell is being updated.

The loop iterates through each pair of `(dx, dy)`. After processing one pair, the loop will continue to the next one until all pairs have been processed.

Given that the previous iteration may have processed one of the pairs, we need to account for the fact that the next iteration will work with the next pair in the list. Since there are 8 pairs in total, if the previous iteration was the first one, then in the next iteration it will process the second pair, and so on.

Therefore, if we assume the last processed `dx, dy` was the first one (-2, -1), the next pair would be (-2, 1).

We have no information about the exact values of `cur`, `ncur`, or the current state of `piece`, `dist`, or `parent`, but we know that these states could potentially change if the conditions are met.

Thus, after processing one pair, the next states would adjust `piece` and potentially the queue based on the conditions, but we also need to ensure that the loop can continue for the next pair.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `piece` remains 0, and `cur` is set to 1 for the next iteration after processing the current `(dx, dy)` pair, and the loop will process the next `(dx, dy)` which is (-2, 1)**
