Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `dist` contains updated distances for all valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 2)` based on the respective `piece` values; `parent` contains predecessors for all valid positions reachable from these coordinates; `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions updated during the iterations, plus any additional tuples of the form `(cur, i)` for each `piece` that was not equal to `i`. If `A[x][y]` was never equal to `cur`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized state.**
