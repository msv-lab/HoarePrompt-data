Postcondition: ***`nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, which is between 4 and 10. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][A[4][2]]` is set to (cur, 1), and `queue` includes (A[4][2], 1). Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
