According to the code, the loop will iterate over the list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates (dx, dy). Since the loop is using a for loop structure, it will take each tuple from the list one at a time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` have been taken from the first tuple in the list, and now we will move to the next tuple in the next iteration. The tuples are processed in the following order: (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1).

Since `dx` and `dy` are currently equal to the first tuple (-1, -1), at the start of the next iteration, they will take the values from the second tuple (-1, 1).

This means in the next iteration:
- `dx` will be -1
- `dy` will be 1

Additionally, the other variables will remain unchanged unless the conditions within the loop body are met. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` remains between 3 and 10, `y` is still 0, `nx` and `ny` will be recalculated based on the new values of `dx` and `dy`, but we don't have enough information to adjust them without more context about their current values.

Therefore, the relevant states to be adjusted for the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`** (assuming current `x` is unchanged for this explanation).
