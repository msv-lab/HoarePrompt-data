Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
