The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the existing values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. The variable `y` is known to be 9, but the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are unknown. Therefore, the new value of `ny` will be `9 + dy`, and the value of `nx` will depend on the unknown values of `x` and `dx`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the current first element of the tuple, `dy` is the current second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`.**
