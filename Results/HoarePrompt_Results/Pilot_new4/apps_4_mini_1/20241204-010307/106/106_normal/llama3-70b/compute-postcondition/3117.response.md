The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`, which is equal to `cur` and `piece`. The previous state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][3]`, but the specific values of `cur`, `A`, and `parent` are unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is set to 1; `x` is at least 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][3]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is set to 1; `x` is at least 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][3]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
