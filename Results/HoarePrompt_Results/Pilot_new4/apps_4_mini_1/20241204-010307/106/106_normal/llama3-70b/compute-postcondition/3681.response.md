Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0 (initial value for the loop), `dist` contains minimum distances, `parent` contains respective parents, `queue` contains reachable positions and piece types based on movement rules. The value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`.***
