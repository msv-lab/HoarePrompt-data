The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we cannot determine their individual contributions to the updated values of `nx` and `ny`. The initial variables remain unchanged except for `nx` and `ny`, which are recalculated based on the expressions provided.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**.
