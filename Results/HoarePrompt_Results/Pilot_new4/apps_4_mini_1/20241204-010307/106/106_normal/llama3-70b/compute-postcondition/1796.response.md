The code snippet updates the `dist` array at index `[1][ncur]` with the value from `dist[1][cur]` incremented by 1. The variables `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. However, we need to focus on the values of `dist` that are affected.

Given the initial state, we have:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `y` is 2
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1
- `piece` is either 0 or 1
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is equal to 3
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`

The impact of the code:
- `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Thus, the state of `dist` is updated at the specific index `[1][ncur]`, while other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 3, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
