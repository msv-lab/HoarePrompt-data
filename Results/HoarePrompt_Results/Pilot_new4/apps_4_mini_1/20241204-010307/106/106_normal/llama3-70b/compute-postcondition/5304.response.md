After executing the code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`, we calculate the new values of `nx` and `ny`:

- The value of `x` is `4`.
- The value of `dx` is `1`.
- The value of `y` is `0`.
- The value of `dy` is `-1`.

Calculating the new values:
- `nx = x + dx = 4 + 1 = 5`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + (-1) = -1`

Now, we need to verify if the new values satisfy the conditions:
- For `nx`, since `5` is not less than `N` (where `N` is between `4` and `10`), `0 <= nx < N` is valid.
- For `ny`, since `-1` is not greater than or equal to `0`, `0 <= ny < N` is not valid.

Since not both conditions are satisfied, `ncur` is not updated, and no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.

Thus, the Output State will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while retaining the original states of other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 5, `ny` is -1**.
