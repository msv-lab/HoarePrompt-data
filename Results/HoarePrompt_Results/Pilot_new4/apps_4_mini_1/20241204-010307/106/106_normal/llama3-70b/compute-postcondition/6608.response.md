The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `1 + dx` and `0 + dy`, respectively. The value of `N` is between 3 and 10, which means `nx` and `ny` must be valid indices for the array `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, `queue` contains reachable positions, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
