The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, which is equal to `cur` and `piece`. The initial state indicates that `dist[1][ncur]` contains minimum distances, and `dist[2][ncur]` has already been calculated as `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The other variables, such as `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`, remain unchanged in the context of this operation. 

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
