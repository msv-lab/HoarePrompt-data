The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the offsets `dx` and `dy`. However, the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. We can only express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, and `x` and `y` are both initialized to 1. Since no other variables are affected, we retain their states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`**
