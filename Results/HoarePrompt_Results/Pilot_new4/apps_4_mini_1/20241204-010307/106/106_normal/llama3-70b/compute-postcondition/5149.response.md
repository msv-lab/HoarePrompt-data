The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D list `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x` and `y` respectively, adjusted by the directions `dx` and `dy`. Since the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `piece`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged apart from `ncur`, the output state will reflect that `ncur` is now equal to the value at `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
