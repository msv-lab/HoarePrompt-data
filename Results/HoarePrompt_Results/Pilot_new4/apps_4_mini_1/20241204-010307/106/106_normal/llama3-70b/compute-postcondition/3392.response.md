The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. Although there are no explicit values provided for `cur` and `ncur`, this assignment indicates that `parent[2][ncur]` will be updated to hold the current position and the piece associated with it.

The other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updates as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[1]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions, `parent[1][ncur]` contains associated parent positions, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` retains updated parent positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and newly appended tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid knight move, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`**.
