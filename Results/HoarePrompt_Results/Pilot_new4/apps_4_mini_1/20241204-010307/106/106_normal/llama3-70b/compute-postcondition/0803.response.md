The code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[0][ncur]` based on the value at `dist[0][cur]`, incrementing it by 1. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `A[0][0]`, `cur`, `piece`, and the validity of `dist[0][ncur]` being greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` will still hold after this operation. 

The new value of `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur]`.**
