Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 0; `dx` is not applicable; `dy` is not applicable; `ncur` is equal to `A[0][0]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state.***
