Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[x - 1][1]`, and if `piece` is 2 and the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, 2), and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, the state remains unchanged.***
