Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; if `nx` is `x + dx` where `dx` is within bounds and `ny` is `y + dy` where `dy` is within bounds, and if both `nx` and `ny` are valid indices (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the indices `nx` and `ny` are invalid, there are no changes to the variables.***
