Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `queue` contains all tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for every valid `(nx, ny)` that satisfies the bounds and conditions, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1` for each valid `ncur` where `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated accordingly for each valid `ncur`, and all values of `ncur` are derived from the positions in the array `A` accessed through valid `nx` and `ny`.**
