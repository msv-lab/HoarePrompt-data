According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent direction changes (dx, dy). Each iteration attempts to update or append information to the `queue`, `dist`, and `parent` based on the current state defined by the variables `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 3 and 10, and `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1). The loop body processes each direction defined in the tuples `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it will move to the next tuple in the list. In this case, since the loop has not yet processed any tuples, it will start with the first tuple `(-1, -1)` on the first iteration. 

After processing the first direction, the next iteration will pick up the second tuple. Therefore, we can say the loop can execute again with the next direction.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1), `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1**
