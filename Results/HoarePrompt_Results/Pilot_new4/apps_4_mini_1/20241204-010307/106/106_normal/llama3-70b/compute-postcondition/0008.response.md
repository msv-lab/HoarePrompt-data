In the provided code snippet, the operation `cur, piece = queue.popleft()` is executed. This line of code removes and returns an element from the left end of the `queue`. The `queue` currently contains one element: `(1, 0)`. 

Now, let's analyze the impact of this operation:

- `cur` will be assigned the first element of the tuple, which is `1`.
- `piece` will be assigned the second element of the tuple, which is `0`.
- After this operation, the `queue` will be empty since the only element has been removed.

The other variables (`N`, `A`, `dist`, `parent`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `A` is a 2D list of distinct integers based on input with N rows; `dist` has `dist[0][1]` equal to `0`, `dist` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to float('inf') with `dist[0][1]` updated; `parent` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to None; `i` is 0; `queue` is empty; `cur` is 1; `piece` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `A` is a 2D list of distinct integers based on input with N rows; `dist` has `dist[0][1]` equal to `0`, `dist` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to float('inf') with `dist[0][1]` updated; `parent` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to None; `i` is 0; `queue` is empty; `cur` is 1; `piece` is 0.**
