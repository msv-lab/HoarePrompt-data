According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `N`, which is between 3 and 10. The loop variable `y` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute again should be that `N` remains between 3 and 10, and `y` becomes 2.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2**
