The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `queue` now has an additional element but will not alter the other existing variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `queue` now contains an additional element `(ncur, 1)`**.
