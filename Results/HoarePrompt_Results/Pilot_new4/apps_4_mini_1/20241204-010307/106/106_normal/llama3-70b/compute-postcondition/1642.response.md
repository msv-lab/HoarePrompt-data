Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all reachable cells and their corresponding pieces that were added during the loop iterations, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and the distance `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
