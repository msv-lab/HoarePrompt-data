Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` points to the predecessors, and the tuple `(cur, i)` is appended to `queue`. If the condition is not met, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values except for the addition to `queue` in the case where the loop does not execute.***
