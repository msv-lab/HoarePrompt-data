The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are still valid, but we need to specify that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `nx` is 3, 4, or 5; `ny` is 1, 2, or 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is now defined as `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
