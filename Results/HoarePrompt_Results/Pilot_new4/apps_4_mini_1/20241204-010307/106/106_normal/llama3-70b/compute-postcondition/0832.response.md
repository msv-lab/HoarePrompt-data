The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are now part of the `queue` collection, reflecting the updated state of the queue after this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[0]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values; `queue` now contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid moves and the new tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`; `current value of dist[1][cur]` is still valid.**
