The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `1` to the `queue`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `piece` are not modified by this operation. The current state of the `queue` will reflect the inclusion of the new element.

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is a variable, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`**.
