The current state assigns `ncur` the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the previous state, which includes the updates from `x` and `y` along with the changes provided by `(dx, dy)` taken from the list. 

Given that `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`, we know the specific values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on what `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` were before this line. 

The other variables, `N`, `piece`, `nx`, and `ny`, remain unchanged and continue to hold their previous values, but now we have a new specific assignment for `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
