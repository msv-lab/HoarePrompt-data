The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `x - 1` and `0`, respectively. Since `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`, the value of `nx` will be between `-1` (when `x = 1`) and `8` (when `x = 9`), given that `N` can be at most `10`. The value of `ny` is `0`.

Thus, the output state will retain all other variable values while updating `ncur` based on the values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][0]`.**
