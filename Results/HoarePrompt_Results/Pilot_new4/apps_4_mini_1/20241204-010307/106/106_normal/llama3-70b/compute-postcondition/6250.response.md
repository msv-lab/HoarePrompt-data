The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and the value `1` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects that a new element has been added to the `queue` without altering the existing values of other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list of tuples for possible moves, `ncur` is valid for `dist` updates when `piece` is 0, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`, `queue` contains the new element `(ncur, 1)`.**
