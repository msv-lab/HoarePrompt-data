In the provided code, `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1, we have:

1. `nx` is updated to `x + (-1)`, which becomes `x - 1`.
2. `ny` is updated to `y + 1`, which becomes `y + 1`.

The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, therefore both `nx` and `ny` must still be within the bounds of `0` and `N-1` after the update. 

However, without knowing the specific values of `x` and `y`, we can only express the new values of `nx` and `ny` in terms of `x` and `y`. 

The other variables (`N`, `y`, `ncur`, `cur`, `piece`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is specifically:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, and `piece` is 1.**
