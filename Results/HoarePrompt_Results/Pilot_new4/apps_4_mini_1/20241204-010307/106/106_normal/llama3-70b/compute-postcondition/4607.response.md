Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves; `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves; `queue` contains potential next states based on valid moves from the initial position. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
