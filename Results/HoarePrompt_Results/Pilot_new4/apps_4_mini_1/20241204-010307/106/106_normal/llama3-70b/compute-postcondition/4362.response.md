The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. Since `queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it exists and is a list or similar structure that can accept the append operation.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but we include `ncur` in the output since it is part of the tuple being appended to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `dist` has valid prior values, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended.**
