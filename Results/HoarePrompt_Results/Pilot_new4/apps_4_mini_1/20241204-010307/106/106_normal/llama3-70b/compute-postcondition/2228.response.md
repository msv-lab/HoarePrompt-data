Postcondition: ***`piece` is 0, `ncur` satisfies the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If the coordinates `(nx, ny)` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `piece` is updated to 1, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][cur]` has increased by 1, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`. If the conditions are not met, then the state remains unchanged.***
