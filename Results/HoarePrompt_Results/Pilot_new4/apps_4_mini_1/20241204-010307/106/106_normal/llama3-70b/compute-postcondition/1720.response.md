The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the earlier state where it is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

The output state remains the same for all variables except for the `queue`, to which a new tuple is added.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
