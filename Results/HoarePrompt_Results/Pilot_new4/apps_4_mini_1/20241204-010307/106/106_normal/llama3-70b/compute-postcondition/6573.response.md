Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` arrays are initialized, `parent` arrays are initialized, `queue` contains valid moves processed during the loop, the current value of `A[1][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` are set for 8 iterations; `nx` is `1 + dx[i]`, `ny` is `0 + dy[i]` for each iteration `i`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
