The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not defined after the loop has completed, so `nx` and `ny` depend on their respective coordinates and the undefined changes by `dx` and `dy`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is the current y-coordinate; `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
