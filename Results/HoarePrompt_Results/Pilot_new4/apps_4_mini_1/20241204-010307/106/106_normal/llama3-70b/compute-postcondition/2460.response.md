According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over a fixed list of tuples: `[(−2,−1), (−2,1), (−1,−2), (−1,2), (1,−2), (1,2), (2,−1), (2,1)]`. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N` and `y`, as the list is predefined and not dependent on these variables. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from each tuple in the list during each iteration.

Before the loop starts, the values of `N` and `y` do not affect the execution of the loop, but they can be acknowledged in the state. Since there are no preconditions that need to be satisfied for the loop to execute, we can simply indicate that `dx` and `dy` will be initialized to the first tuple values.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
