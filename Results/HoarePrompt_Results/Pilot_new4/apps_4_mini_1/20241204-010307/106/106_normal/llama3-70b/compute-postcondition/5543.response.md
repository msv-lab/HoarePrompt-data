In this code snippet, the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[0][cur]`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[-2][1]`.

The specific change happens to `dist[0][ncur]`, which will now hold the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The previous values of `dist[0][cur]` and `ncur` are not provided, but the output must reflect the change in `dist[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1.**
