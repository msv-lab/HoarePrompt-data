In the given code snippet, `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the coordinates `[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is equal to `x`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. The initial state indicates that `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, but does not affect the assignment to `ncur`.

The impact of the code is as follows:
- `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, which translates to `A[x][y + 1]`.

Everything else in the initial state remains unchanged, so we update only `ncur`.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]**.
