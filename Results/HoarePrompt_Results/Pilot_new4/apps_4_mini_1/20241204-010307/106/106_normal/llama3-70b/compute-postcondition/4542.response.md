The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x` and `y` based on the given `dx` and `dy`, where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `y`. The initial state provides that the array `A` has been defined such that `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`. 

Thus, `ncur` will take the value from the array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `y`. 

The preconditions that remain valid after this code execution are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is still 0
- `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged
- `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged
- `dx` is 1
- `dy` is 0
- `nx` is `x + 1`
- `ny` is `y`

The specific values depend on the values of `x` and `y`, as well as the contents of the array `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`.**
