To analyze the code snippet, we need to understand the impact of the assignments on the variables involved:

1. From the initial state, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][-1]`. This establishes `ncur` as the last element from the `nx`th row of the array `A`.

2. The next line of code updates the `parent` array at the position `[0][ncur]` and assigns it the value `cur` (which is presumably defined elsewhere).

Given that `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, the only variables that are updated within this execution are `parent[0][ncur]`.

The output state reflects these changes while keeping all other variables intact. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][-1]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
