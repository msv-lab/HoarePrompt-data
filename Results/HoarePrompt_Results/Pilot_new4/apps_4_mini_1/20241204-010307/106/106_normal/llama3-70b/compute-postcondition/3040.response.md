Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `dist[1]` stores the shortest distances based on updates, `parent[1]` reflects predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all processed tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The current value of `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
