The line of code assigns a new value to `parent[2][ncur]`, resulting in `parent[2][ncur]` being set to the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The previous values of the affected variables remain relevant, and no other variables are changed. Therefore, the output state will reflect these updates.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` now includes `parent[2][ncur] = (cur, piece)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
