Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dist` contains the minimum distances for all reachable cells from the starting position based on valid moves for each piece type, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for all reachable cells based on the piece type conditions, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, piece)` generated during the iterations, and `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions. If no valid moves were found, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `queue` may be empty.**
