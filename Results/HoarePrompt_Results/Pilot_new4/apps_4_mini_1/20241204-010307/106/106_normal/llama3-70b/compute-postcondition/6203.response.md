The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values using expressions that include `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically:

- For `nx`, the expression `x + dx` is used, where `dx` is currently `0`, so `nx` is assigned the value of `x + 0`, which simplifies to `nx = x`.
- For `ny`, the expression `y + dy` is used, where `dy` is currently `-1`, so `ny` is assigned the value of `y - 1`, which simplifies to `ny = 1 - 1`, resulting in `ny = 0`.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, and `dy` is -1, the states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x`, and `ny` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 0.**
