Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy` for all dy values in the loop, `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for all dx values in the loop, and both `nx` and `ny` must be between 0 and N (exclusive) for at least some iterations. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for any valid `ncur`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated accordingly, `parent[0][ncur]` reflects the last valid `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for all valid updates. If no iterations are valid, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
