According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the directional changes for a knight's moves on a chessboard. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are related to the variables `dx` and `dy`, which are the components for the knight's potential moves. 

Since the loop will iterate over the defined list of tuples, `dx` and `dy` will take on values from that list on each iteration. The list contains four tuples, thus the loop will execute four times, with each iteration yielding different values for `dx` and `dy`. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, it is necessary to note that `dx` and `dy` will be initialized to the first tuple `(-1, -1)` in the context of the first iteration. There are no additional conditions regarding the state of other variables necessary for this loop to execute.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, `parent[0][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` appended for each valid move resulting in an update to `dist[0][ncur]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1 for the first iteration.**
