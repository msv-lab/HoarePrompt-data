Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for every reachable cell from `(x, y)` based on the conditions met. `parent[0][ncur]` contains the previous cell `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains tuples of reachable cells and their corresponding piece value. If no cells are reachable, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
