The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` do not alter any other variables or the conditions set in the initial state. The value of `ncur` is still dependent on `nx`, `ny`, `A`, `dist`, `cur`, and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
