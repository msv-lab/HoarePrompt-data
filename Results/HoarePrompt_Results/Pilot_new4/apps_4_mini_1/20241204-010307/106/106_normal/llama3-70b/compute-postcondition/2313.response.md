Postcondition: ***`dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `dist` remains unchanged except that `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)` if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the assignment. The values of `parent`, `queue`, and `dist` remain unchanged for any case where the condition is not met.***
