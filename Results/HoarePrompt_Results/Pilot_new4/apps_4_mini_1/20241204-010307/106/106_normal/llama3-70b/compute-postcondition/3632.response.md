The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the coordinates `(nx, ny)`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid, it is ensured that `A[nx][ny]` is accessible. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
