The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The initial conditions provide that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and that `dist[0][ncur]` has already been updated. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur and piece`.**
