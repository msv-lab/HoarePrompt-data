Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the updated parent at index `0` for `ncur`, which is now `cur`, `queue` contains one element `(ncur, 0)` in addition to the original element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`.**
