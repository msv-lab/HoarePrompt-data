The code appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are now included in the `queue`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
