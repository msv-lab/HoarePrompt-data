The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are used directly, while the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `queue` is now updated with the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
