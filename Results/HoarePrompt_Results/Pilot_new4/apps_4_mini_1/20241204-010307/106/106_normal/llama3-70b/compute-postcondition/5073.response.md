The code updates the `parent` array. Specifically, the entry `parent[2][ncur]` is set to the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of `cur`, `piece`, and `ncur` remain the same as before the execution. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 2)`.**
