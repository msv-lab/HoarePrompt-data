The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + 1` and `y + 1`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will hold the value of `A[x + 1][y + 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y + 1]`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` where `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y + 1]`, `piece` is 1, and the next `(dx, dy)` pair being processed is `(1, 1)`**.
