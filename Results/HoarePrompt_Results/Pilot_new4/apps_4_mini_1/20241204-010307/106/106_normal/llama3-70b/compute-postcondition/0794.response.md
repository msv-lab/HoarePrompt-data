The code `cur, piece = queue.popleft()` impacts the program by removing the first element from the `queue` and assigning its values to `cur` and `piece`. The `queue` must have contained at least one tuple of reachable states, so after executing this code, `queue` will have one less tuple, and `cur` and `piece` will hold the values of that tuple.

Since the specific values of `cur` and `piece` depend on the first tuple in `queue`, we cannot determine their exact values without additional information. However, we know that they have been updated from the first element of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point for each piece type, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for each `piece`, `queue` has one less tuple, `cur` is the first element of the removed tuple, `piece` is the second element of the removed tuple.**
