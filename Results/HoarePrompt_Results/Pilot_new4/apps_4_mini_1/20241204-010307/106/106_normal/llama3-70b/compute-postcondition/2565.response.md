To analyze the impact of the code snippet on the given initial state:

1. The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` will assign new values to `nx` and `ny`.
2. Given that `dx` is -2, the expression for `nx` will become `x - 2`.
3. Since `dy` is 1, the expression for `ny` will become `y + 1`.
4. The variables `N`, `y`, and the original definitions of `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged; only `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on the calculations.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `nx` and `ny`, while retaining the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
