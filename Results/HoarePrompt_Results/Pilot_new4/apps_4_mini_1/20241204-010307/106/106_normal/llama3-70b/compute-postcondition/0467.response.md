The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous values still hold. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made by the code while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is equal to 3; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
