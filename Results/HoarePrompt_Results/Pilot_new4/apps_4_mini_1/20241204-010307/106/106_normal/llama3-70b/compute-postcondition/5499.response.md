The code adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `queue` are affected by this operation. The values of `ncur` and `queue` will change, but the initial value of `ncur` is still valid. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `nx` is 3, 4, or 5; `ny` is 1, 2, or 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is now defined as `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
