Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and now also (ncur, 1). If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. Additionally, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where both `nx` and `ny` are computed based on the given `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` values within the specified boundaries. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
