The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` may contain tuples of positions that were explored, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` may contain tuples of positions that were explored, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
