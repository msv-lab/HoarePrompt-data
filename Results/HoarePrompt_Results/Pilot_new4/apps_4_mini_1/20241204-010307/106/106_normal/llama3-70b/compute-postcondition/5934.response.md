Given the initial state that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dx` is 0, and `dy` is 1. 

The code snippet provided is:

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Here, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Since `dx` is 0, `nx` will be equal to `x`. The value of `ny` will be `y + 1` because `dy` is 1.

However, the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express `nx` as `x` and `ny` as `y + 1`.

Since `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `ny` will range from 1 (if `y` is 0) to 9 (if `y` is 8). 

The output state will thus reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while providing the constraints on `N` and the range of `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x`; `ny` is between 1 and 9 (inclusive).**
