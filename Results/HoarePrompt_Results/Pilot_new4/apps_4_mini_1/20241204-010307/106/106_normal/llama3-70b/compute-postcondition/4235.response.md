The values of `nx` and `ny` are being assigned based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `x` is 1, and `y` is `N - 1`, where `N` is an integer between 3 and 10. Therefore, `y` can take values between 2 and 9. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified, so we will leave them as variables.

After executing `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`, the new values for `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `dx` and `dy` but will be defined as follows:

- `nx` will be equal to `1 + dx`.
- `ny` will be equal to `N - 1 + dy`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as only `nx` and `ny` are affected. Therefore, the Output State will capture the ranges for `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, and `queue` contains the tuples representing all reachable points and their associated pieces after processing all valid moves defined by the `dx` and `dy` offsets.**
