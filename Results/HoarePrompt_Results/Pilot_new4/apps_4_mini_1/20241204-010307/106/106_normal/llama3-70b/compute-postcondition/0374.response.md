The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous values of `ncur` and `0` are used for this operation. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
