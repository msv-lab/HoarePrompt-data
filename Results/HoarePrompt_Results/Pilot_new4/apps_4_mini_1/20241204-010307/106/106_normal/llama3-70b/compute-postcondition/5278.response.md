The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `nx` is equal to 2 and `ny` is equal to 1, so `ncur` becomes `A[2][1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`.**
