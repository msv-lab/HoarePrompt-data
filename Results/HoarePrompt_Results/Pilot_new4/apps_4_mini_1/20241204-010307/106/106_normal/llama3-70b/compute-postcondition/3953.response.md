Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`, and `queue` now contains `((ncur, 0))`.**
