The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist[0][ncur]`, `ncur`, and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

The output state will indicate that the `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]; parent[0][ncur]` is equal to the tuple `(cur, 0); queue` has an additional tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended.**
