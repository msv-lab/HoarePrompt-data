The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and 0 to the `queue` list. The values of `ncur` and 0 are determined from the initial state. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9; `y` is 9; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 7; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][7]; dist[0][ncur] is equal to dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur] is equal to cur; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
