Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is an integer between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is an integer between 0 and `N-1`; if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances from the position represented by `cur` to all valid `ncur` positions for piece 2, `parent[2]` contains the parent positions and pieces for all valid `ncur`, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `queue` now contains the previously existing tuples along with the new tuple `(cur, i)`; otherwise, if no valid moves are found, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
