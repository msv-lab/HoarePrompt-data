The code snippet assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the values of `dx` and `dy`. The variables `x` and `y` must lie within the range of 0 to N-1, ensuring that the new values are still valid for the specified grid or matrix defined by `N`. The previous states of `A`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unaffected by this operation.

Since `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` will take on new integer values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within 0 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dist[0]` has been updated for valid positions, `parent[0]` is set accordingly, `queue` contains valid tuples from previous executions.**
