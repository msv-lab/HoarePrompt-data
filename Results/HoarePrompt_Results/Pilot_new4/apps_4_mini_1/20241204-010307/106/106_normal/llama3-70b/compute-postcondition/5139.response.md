Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` must be appropriately initialized, `parent` must reflect valid parent tuples, `queue` must contain valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, meaning 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
