To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the code's impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
   - `y` is 2
   - `piece` is 1
   - `dx` is -1
   - `dy` is 0
   - `nx` is `x - 1` (where `x` is presumably an integer; however, its value is not specified)
   - `ny` is 2

2. **Code Execution:** 
   - The code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value of `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]` to the variable `ncur`.
   - The value of `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 2. 
   - Without knowing the value of `x`, we cannot explicitly determine the value of `nx` or the value of `ncur`, but we know that `ny` is fixed as 2.

3. **Variables Involved:**
   - `A` is a two-dimensional array or list, and without its definition or contents, we can't ascertain what `A[nx][ny]` would be.
   - The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged.

4. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The output state includes the unchanged variables along with the assignment to `ncur`, which depends on the values of `nx` and `ny`.

Since we can't compute an explicit value for `ncur`, we will denote it based on the indices used:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
