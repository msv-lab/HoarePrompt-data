The `queue` is updated to include a new tuple containing `ncur` and `1`. The `ncur` variable is not specified in the initial state; thus, it remains unchanged. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, and `parent` remain the same as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `dist` reflects the updated distances; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
