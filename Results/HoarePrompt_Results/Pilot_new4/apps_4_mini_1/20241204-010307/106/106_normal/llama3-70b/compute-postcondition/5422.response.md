Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 2. If `dist[2][ncur]` (where `ncur` is `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`) is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur and piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur.***
