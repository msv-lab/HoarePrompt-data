The code assigns the value of `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but `ncur` is determined from `nx`, which is `x - 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 10, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][10]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
