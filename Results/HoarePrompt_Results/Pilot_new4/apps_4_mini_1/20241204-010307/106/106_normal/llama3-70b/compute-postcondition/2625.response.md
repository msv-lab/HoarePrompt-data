Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `dx` must be (0, 1), `dy` must be (0, 1), `nx` is either `x` or `x + 1`, `ny` is either `y` or `y + 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
