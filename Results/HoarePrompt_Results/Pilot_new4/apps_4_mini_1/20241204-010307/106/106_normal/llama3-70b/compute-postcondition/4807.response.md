Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is `dx`, `y` is `dy`, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` have been updated for all reachable positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
