Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, and the `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the `queue` now contains the new pair `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
