The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The initial values for the relevant variables are as follows: `parent` reflects the updated tuples, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][0]`. Given that `piece` is `1`, the state of `parent[1][ncur]` will reflect that it is now assigned `(cur, 1)`.

The other variables are unaffected in this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, 1)`, `queue` contains valid tuples and includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][0]`.**
