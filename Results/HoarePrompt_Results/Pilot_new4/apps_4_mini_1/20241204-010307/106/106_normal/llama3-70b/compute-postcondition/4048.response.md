Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is `A[-2][2]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` remains unchanged, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables.***
