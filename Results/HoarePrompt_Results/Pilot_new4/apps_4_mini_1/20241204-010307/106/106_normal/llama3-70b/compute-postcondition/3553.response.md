Given the initial state, we can analyze the impact of the code snippet:

- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`. Since `dx` is 1, `nx` becomes `x + 1`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Since `dy` is -1, `ny` becomes `y - 1`.

Since `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, the minimum value of `x` can be `0` and the maximum can be `N-1`. Therefore, `nx` will range from `1` (if `x` is `0`) to `N` (if `x` is `N-1`, which is the maximum value for this range).

Similarly, since `y` is also within `0` and `N-1`, the minimum value of `y` can be `0` and the maximum can be `N-1`, thus `ny` will range from `-1` (if `y` is `0`) to `N-2` (if `y` is `N-1`, which is the maximum value for this range).

The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`.**
