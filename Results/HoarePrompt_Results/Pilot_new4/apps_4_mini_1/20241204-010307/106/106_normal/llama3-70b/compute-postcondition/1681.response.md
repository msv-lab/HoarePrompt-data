The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the calculations involving `dx` and `dy`. The initial values are `dx = -2` and `dy = -1`, and `y` is `1`. Therefore, the calculations for `nx` and `ny` would result in:

- `nx = x + dx`, which becomes `x - 2`.
- `ny = y + dy`, which becomes `1 - 1`, resulting in `0`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is updated as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0**.
