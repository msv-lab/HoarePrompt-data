Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, and `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the new tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to the `queue`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
