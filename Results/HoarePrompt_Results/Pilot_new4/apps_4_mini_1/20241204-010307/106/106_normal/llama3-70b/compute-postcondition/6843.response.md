The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`. The value being assigned is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which means that the distance at index `[0][ncur]` is being updated to be one greater than the distance at index `[0][cur]`. 

- The variable `cur` holds the value corresponding to `A[x][y]`, and thus `dist[0][cur]` holds some value representing the distance for that specific index. 
- The variable `ncur` is derived from `A[x + dx][dy]`, which means that it points to a different index in the `dist` array, specifically indexed by `0` and `ncur`.

The other variables (`N`, `y`, `A`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`) and the structure of the distances in the `dist` array remain unchanged. 

So, the Output State, incorporating the changes from the execution of the code, is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][dy]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
