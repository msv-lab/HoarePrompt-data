Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` must contain valid tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is equal to 2, and the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than the distance from `dist[2][cur]` plus 1.***
