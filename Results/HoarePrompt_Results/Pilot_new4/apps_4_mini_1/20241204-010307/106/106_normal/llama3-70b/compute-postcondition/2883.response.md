The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, which is set to `(cur, piece)`. The other variables remain unchanged or retain their previous state. The output state will reflect the updated value of the `parent` array while maintaining the previously defined conditions for other variables. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist` is updated at index [2][ncur] to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent` is updated at index [2][ncur] to be equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` is unchanged, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
