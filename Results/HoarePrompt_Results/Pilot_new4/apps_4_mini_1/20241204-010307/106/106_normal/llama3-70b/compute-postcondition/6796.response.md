The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are known (1 and 2, respectively), but the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `1 + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `2 + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[1]` is updated for valid positions, `parent[1]` is set for valid positions, `queue` can be empty or contain valid positions that were reachable.**
