The `queue` variable is modified by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `0`. The other variables remain unchanged, but we now have the new state of `queue` updated with the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
