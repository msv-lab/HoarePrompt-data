Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is not met, no further actions are taken.***
