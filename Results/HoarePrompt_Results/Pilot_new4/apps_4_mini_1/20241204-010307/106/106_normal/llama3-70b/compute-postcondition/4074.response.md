The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are used directly, as the state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ncur` is added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `ncur` is appended to `queue` along with the value `1`.**
