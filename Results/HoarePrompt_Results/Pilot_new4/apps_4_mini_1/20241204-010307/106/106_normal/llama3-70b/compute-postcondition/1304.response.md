The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The value of `x` is 1, and the value of `y` is 2. The values for `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. 

Now, we will compute the values of `nx` and `ny` for these pairs:

1. For `dx = -1` and `dy = 0`: 
   - `nx = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   - `ny = 2 + 0 = 2`
2. For `dx = 1` and `dy = 0`: 
   - `nx = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `ny = 2 + 0 = 2`
3. For `dx = 0` and `dy = -1`: 
   - `nx = 1 + 0 = 1`
   - `ny = 2 + (-1) = 1`
4. For `dx = 0` and `dy = 1`: 
   - `nx = 1 + 0 = 1`
   - `ny = 2 + 1 = 3`

Thus, after executing the code, we will have multiple possible values for `nx` and `ny` depending on the pair selected from the list.

The output state must reflect that `nx` and `ny` can take on multiple values based on different pairs of `dx` and `dy`. The original values of `N`, `x`, and `y` are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 2, 2, 1, or 3 depending on selected `dx` and `dy` from the list.**
