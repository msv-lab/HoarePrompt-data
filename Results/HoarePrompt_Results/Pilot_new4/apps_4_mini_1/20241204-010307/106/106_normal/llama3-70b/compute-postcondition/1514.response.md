The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, thus they will remain unknown, but we know they are assigned to the element at the specified index. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `(dx, dy)` is (-2, -1), `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
