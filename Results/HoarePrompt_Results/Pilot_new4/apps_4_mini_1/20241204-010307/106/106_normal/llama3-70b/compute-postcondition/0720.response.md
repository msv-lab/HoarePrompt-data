In the given code snippet, the line `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist`) remain unchanged, so we need to list those states as they are.

The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to hold the value of `cur`. The values of the other variables are:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `nx` is `x - 2`
- `ny` is 1
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated value of `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`.**
