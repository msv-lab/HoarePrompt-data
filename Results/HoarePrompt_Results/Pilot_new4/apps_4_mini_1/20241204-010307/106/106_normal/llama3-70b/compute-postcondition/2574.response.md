The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `dx`, or `dy`, so we cannot specify the resulting values of `nx` and `ny`. However, we know that the values of `N`, `y`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is defined, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
