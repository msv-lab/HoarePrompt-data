The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged. The output state includes the information that `parent[1][ncur]` now holds the values of `cur` and `piece`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
