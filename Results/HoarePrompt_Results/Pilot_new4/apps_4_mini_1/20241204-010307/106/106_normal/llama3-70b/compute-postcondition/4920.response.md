The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The previous conditions state that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, with `y` adjusted to be between 0 and `N-2`. Therefore, `ncur` will depend on the specific values stored in the array `A` at the calculated indices. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is still 0 if not modified, `dist[0][ncur]` may still need to be compared and potentially updated, and `parent[0][ncur]` and `queue` might be modified based on the next values of `nx` and `ny`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
