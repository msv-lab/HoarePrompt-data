The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The previous state indicates that `queue` already contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` that were added during the loop iterations. The specific value of `cur` and `i` is not provided, but we know that:

- `piece` is 2 and is not equal to `i`, meaning that the code is adding the current state represented by `(cur, i)` to the `queue`, which may or may not have been a valid addition based on the context provided.

No other existing variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`) are affected by this operation, and the previous values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` now contains all previous tuples plus the tuple `(cur, i)`, and `piece` is 2 which is not equal to `i`.**
