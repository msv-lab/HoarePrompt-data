According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the list `[(dx, dy)]` which contains the direction vectors for movement. The loop will iterate over each direction vector to potentially update distances. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed one direction vector out of the four possible directions: `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`.

Since the loop iterates over these four direction vectors, and if the loop has just executed for the last direction vector, it must now be ready to process the next one. However, if it has already processed all four direction vectors, the loop will not execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop processed the last direction vector `(0, 1)`, meaning the loop has already completed its iterations for all direction vectors. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to reset the loop to the first direction vector again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to represent that it is ready to start from the beginning of the list of direction vectors.

State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `piece` is equal to 2, and the loop is ready to execute with (dx, dy) set to (-1, 0)**
