The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added as they are, without any changes to their state. The condition regarding `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur]` is already stated as no longer valid, so it doesn't change after executing this code. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur]` is no longer valid; the `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
