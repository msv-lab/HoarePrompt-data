The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the initial values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. 

From the initial state:
- `dx` is 2
- `dy` is 1
- `y` is 2
- The value of `x` is not explicitly defined, but `nx` becomes `x + 2`.

Thus:
- `nx` becomes `x + 2` (unchanged since we don't know `x`)
- `ny` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.

Therefore, `ny` is updated to 3, and `nx` remains defined as `x + 2`.

Since `ny` was initially equal to 3, it remains the same after the operation.

The Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2**
