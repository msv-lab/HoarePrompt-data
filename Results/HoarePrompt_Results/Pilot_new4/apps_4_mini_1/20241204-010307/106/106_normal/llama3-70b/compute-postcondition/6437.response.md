Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is either -1 or 1; `ny` is either 0, 2, or both based on the combinations of `dx` and `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains `((ncur, 1),)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
