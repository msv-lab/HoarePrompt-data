The code snippet adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The `queue` is now updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` has been updated to include `(ncur, 2)`.**
