Given the initial state: `N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`.

The code snippet assigns a value to `ncur` based on the values of `nx` and `ny` as follows:

1. `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`.
2. The variables `nx` and `ny` are already defined: `nx = x - 1` and `ny = y`.

Therefore, the state of the program after the execution of the code will remain the same for `N`, `dx`, `dy`, and the expressions for `nx` and `ny`. 

Since we do not have specific values for `x` and `y`, we cannot compute the exact value for `ncur`, but we can represent it in terms of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`.**
