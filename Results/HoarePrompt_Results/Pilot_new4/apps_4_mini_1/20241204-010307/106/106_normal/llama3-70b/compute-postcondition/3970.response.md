Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
