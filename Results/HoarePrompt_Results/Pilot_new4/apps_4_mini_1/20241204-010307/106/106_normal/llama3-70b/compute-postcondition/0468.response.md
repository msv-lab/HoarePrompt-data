The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current state of the relevant variables is as follows: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is equal to 3; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `piece` is unchanged; and now `queue` includes the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is equal to 3; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `piece` is unchanged; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
