Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions are not satisfied, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
