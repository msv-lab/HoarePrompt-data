Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
