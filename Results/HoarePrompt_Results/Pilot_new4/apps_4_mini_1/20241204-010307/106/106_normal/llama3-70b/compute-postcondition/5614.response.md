The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the position `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` will determine what is stored in `parent[0][ncur]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N` are satisfied, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is (cur, piece)**.
