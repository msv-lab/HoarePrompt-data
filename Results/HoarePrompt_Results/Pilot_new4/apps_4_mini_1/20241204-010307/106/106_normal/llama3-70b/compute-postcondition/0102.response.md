Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx` (undefined due to undefined `x` and `dx`), both `nx` is between 0 and N (inclusive of 0 but exclusive of N), and `ny` is between 0 and N (inclusive of 0 but exclusive of N); `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
