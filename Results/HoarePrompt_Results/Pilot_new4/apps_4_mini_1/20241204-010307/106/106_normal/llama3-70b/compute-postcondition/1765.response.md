Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is 3; if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and `N`, then `ncur` is set to `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, there are no changes made.***
