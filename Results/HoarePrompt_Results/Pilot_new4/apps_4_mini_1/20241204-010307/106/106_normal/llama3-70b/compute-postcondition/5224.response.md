The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `x` and `y` are defined to be between `0` and `N-1` and `1` and `N-1`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are assumed to be predefined changes in `x` and `y`. The output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny` but retains the ranges of `N`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 1 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
