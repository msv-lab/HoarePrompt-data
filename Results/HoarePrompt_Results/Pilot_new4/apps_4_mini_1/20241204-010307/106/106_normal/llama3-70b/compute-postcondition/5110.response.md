According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable provided. The loop will iterate over the list of tuples `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, which contains four elements. Since the loop itself doesn't rely on the state of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` to run, it will execute regardless of these states. 

However, you need to ensure that `piece` reflects the correct status regarding whether any valid moves were found during iterations. If `piece` is 0, it indicates that conditions for updating distances were satisfied at least once, which might not be the case if no valid moves were found.

Thus, the key points that must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute correctly would include the need for `piece` to be set appropriately, indicating that the loop can run successfully and that it should be able to potentially find valid moves.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` should be 0 indicating conditions for updating distances were satisfied at least once**
