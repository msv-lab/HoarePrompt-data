Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `ncur` is appended to `queue` with the value `1`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur. Otherwise, if the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` is false, no actions are taken.***
