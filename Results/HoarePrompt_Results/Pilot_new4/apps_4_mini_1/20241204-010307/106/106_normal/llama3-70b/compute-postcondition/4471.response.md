The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The variables `nx` and `ny` have specific values, and since `nx` is equal to `x - 2` and `ny` is equal to `-1`, we are accessing a specific row and column in the array `A`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, but `ncur` will hold the value from `A[nx][-1]`. 

However, since `ny` is `-1`, it is important to note that this index may reference the last column of the row if Python's negative indexing is considered. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`.**
