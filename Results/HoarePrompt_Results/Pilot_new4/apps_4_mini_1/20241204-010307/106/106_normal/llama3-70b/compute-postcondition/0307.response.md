The `queue` variable is modified by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `1`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged since the code only affects the `queue`. `ncur` is already defined, and it represents a value from the grid, while `1` is the value of `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), `piece` is 1, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
