The `queue` is being updated to include a new tuple consisting of the values `(ncur, 1)`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, except for the addition to the `queue`. The state of `N`, `y`, `A[x][0]`, `dist`, `parent`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `dx` and `dy` are the second tuple in the list of possible moves, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
