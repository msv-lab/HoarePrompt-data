Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
