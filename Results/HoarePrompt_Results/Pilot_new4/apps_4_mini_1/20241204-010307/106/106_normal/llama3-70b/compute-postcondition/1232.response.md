`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are 1 and 2, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so they remain unknown. The states of the other variables (`N`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`) are not affected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `dist` is updated for all reachable positions based on conditions, `parent` reflects the paths taken for those positions, `queue` contains tuples for all updated positions that met the conditions, including the tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
