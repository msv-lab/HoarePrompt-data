Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, and if `nx` and `ny` are both between 0 and N-1, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `2`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state.***
