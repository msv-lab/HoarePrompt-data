To analyze the code snippet, let's first determine the values of `dx` and `dy`. Since these values are not explicitly provided in the initial state, we cannot establish a concrete output for `nx` and `ny`. However, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

1. The initial state provides that:
   - `N` is between 3 and 10 (inclusive).
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `nx` is `1 + (-1)`, which evaluates to `0`.
   - `ny` is `1 + (-1)`, which evaluates to `0`.

2. The code modifies `nx` and `ny` to `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively:
   - `nx` becomes `1 + dx`.
   - `ny` becomes `1 + dy`.

Since we have no specific values for `dx` and `dy`, we cannot compute specific values for `nx` and `ny`. Instead, we can express their new values as:

- `nx = 1 + dx`
- `ny = 1 + dy`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`**.
