The assignment `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][-1]`, and since we know that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this means that the value of `dist[0][cur]` must have been below `dist[0][ncur]` before the assignment. 

Thus, `dist[0][ncur]` will now be updated to a value that is greater than its previous value. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][-1]`, `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
