The line of code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` by adding 1 to the current value of `dist[2][cur]`. The initial conditions indicate that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but the previous value of `cur` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot concretely define the value of `dist[2][ncur]` since it depends on `cur`.

The output state will retain all previous values of the variables, while indicating that `dist[2][ncur]` has been updated based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; the next (dx, dy) will be (1, 0); `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
