The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The states of the other variables (`dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
