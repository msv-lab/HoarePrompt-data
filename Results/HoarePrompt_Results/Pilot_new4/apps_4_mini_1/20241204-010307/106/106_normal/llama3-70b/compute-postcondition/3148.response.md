Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` remains 1 if no valid `(nx, ny)` pairs are found. If valid pairs are found, `piece` is updated to 2 for those pairs. `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distance values based on updates made during the iterations, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the last valid `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur` updated, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` pairs added during the iterations. If no valid pairs were found, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
