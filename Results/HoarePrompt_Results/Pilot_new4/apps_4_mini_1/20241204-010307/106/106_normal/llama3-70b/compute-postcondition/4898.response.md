The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and also updates `piece`. The previous values of the affected variables are `parent[2][ncur]`, which was previously unspecified, and `piece`, which is updated but its original value is unknown.

Since `ncur` is derived from `A[x + 1][y]`, which may vary based on `x` and `y`, and `cur` is provided directly as the variable to be assigned, we can conclude that the output state reflects these changes. 

The states of `N`, `dist[1]`, `dist[2]`, `parent[1]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged as they have not been impacted by the assignment, but the state of `parent[2][ncur]` has changed to `cur`, and `piece` is updated as well.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`, and `piece` is updated.**
