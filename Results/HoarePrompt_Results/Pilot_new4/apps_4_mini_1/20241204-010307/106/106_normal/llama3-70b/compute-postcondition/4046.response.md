The code assigns values to `parent[0][ncur]` based on `cur` and `piece`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is `A[-2][2]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
