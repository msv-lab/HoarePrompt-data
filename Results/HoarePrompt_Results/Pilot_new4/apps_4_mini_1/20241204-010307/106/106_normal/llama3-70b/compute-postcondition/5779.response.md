Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `dist` is updated to reflect the minimum distances from `cur` for all valid `ncur`, `parent` is updated to store the previous states `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples of `(ncur, piece)` for which the distance conditions were satisfied throughout all iterations. If the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` would remain unchanged from their initial state.**
