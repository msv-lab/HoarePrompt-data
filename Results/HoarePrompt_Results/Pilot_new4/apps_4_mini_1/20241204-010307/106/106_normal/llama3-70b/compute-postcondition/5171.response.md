Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
