The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The update affects only the `parent` variable.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` still contains at least one tuple of a reachable position; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
