Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[2]` contains potential updated distances for valid cells, `parent[2]` contains corresponding parents for valid cells. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(cur, i)`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged.***
