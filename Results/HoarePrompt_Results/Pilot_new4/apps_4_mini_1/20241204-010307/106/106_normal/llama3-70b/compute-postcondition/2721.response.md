To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions based on the provided states:

1. The variable `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10. This indicates that `N` is always a valid integer and does not affect whether the loop can execute.
2. The variable `y` is the final y-coordinate which will be updated to `y + 1`. This means that the current value of `y` is relevant for the loop if any computations or conditions within the loop body depend on `y`.
3. The variable `piece` must not equal `i`. This suggests there is a condition that `piece` must be different from some iteration-specific variable `i`. However, the loop itself does not explicitly define what `i` is; it may be understood as a variable that changes with each iteration of the loop.

Now, let's consider the loop structure:
```python
for (dx, dy) in [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute for each tuple `(dx, dy)` in the provided list. The number of iterations is fixed at 8 because there are 8 tuples in the list.

For the loop to execute, the most relevant states to ensure are:
1. `piece` should be defined in relation to the values of `dx` and `dy` if any computation using `piece` is dependent on them. However, the loop will execute regardless of `piece` as long as its condition is met.
2. The values `dx` and `dy` are not directly dependent on `N` or `y`, so those do not need adjustments for loop execution.

Therefore, the adjustments needed primarily involve ensuring that `piece` is not equal to whatever value `i` represents at the start of the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`**
