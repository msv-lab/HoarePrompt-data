The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 1, the value of `nx` will be `x + 1` and the value of `ny` will be `y + 1`.

The value of `y` is given as 3, so `ny` will be `3 + 1 = 4`. The value of `x` is an integer between `0` and `N-1` (since `0 <= x < N`), but the exact value of `x` is not provided. Therefore, `nx` will be `x + 1`, which could range from `1` to `N` (since `x` can be at most `N - 1`).

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, and `ny` is 4.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4.**
