Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `dist[0]` is updated for valid `ncur` values based on the conditions of the loop, `parent[0]` is assigned valid values for those `ncur` positions, `queue` contains the valid `ncur` entries that were appended during the loop execution, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
