The code assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` is already greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this indicates that `dist[0][cur]` was previously smaller than `dist[0][ncur] - 1`. 

Since `dist[0][ncur]` changes, we need to specify its new value. The condition `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` remains valid, but now `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain as they were with the following specifications:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` equals `N`
- `ny` equals `N + dy`
- `nx` equals `x + dx` (undefined due to undefined `x` and `dx`), both `nx` is between 0 and N (exclusive of N), and `ny` is between 0 and N (exclusive of N)
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is equal to 0
- `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`  

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx` (undefined), both `nx` is between 0 and N (exclusive), and `ny` is between 0 and N (exclusive); `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`).**
