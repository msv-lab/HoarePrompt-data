The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The initial state specifies that `nx` is equal to `x` and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, which means `ny` will be updated to `y + 1` with the current value.

Since `nx` and `ny` are being updated, we need to keep track of the new values:

- `nx` becomes `x + dx`
- `ny` becomes `y + dy`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

`N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]**
