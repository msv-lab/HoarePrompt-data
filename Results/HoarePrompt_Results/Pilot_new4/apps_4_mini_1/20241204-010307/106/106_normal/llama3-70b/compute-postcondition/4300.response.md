The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged. The state of the `queue` will be modified to include the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
