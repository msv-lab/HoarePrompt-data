The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D list `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` were previously defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, and are guaranteed to be within the bounds of the grid. Thus, `ncur` will now reflect the value stored in `A` at those calculated indices.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `piece`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where the conditions are met, `piece` remains unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
