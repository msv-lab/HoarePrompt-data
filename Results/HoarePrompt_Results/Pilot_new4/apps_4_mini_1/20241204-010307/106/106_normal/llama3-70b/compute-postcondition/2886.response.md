Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist` remains as it is, `parent` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][cur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` has appended `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, all variables remain unchanged.***
