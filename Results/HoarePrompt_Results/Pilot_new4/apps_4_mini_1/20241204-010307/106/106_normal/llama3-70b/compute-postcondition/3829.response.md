The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`, which affects the `queue` variable. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves; `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1; parent[2][ncur]` is assigned a tuple `(cur, 2)`.**
