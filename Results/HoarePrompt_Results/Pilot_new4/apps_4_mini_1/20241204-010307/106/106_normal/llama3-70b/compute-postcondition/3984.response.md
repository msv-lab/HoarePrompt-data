The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial values for `x` and `y` are both `0`, while `dx` and `dy` are both `1`. Therefore, we compute:

- `nx = x + dx = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + 1 = 1`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1**
