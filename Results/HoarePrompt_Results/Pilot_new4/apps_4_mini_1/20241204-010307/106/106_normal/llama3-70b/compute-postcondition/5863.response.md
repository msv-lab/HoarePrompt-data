Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` and `y` can be any values within bounds as the loop may update them multiple times; `piece` is 2 if conditions were met at least once; `dist[2][ncur]` contains the final distances from `cur` for all valid `ncur`, potentially updated multiple times during the iterations; `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last position and state of `piece` for each valid `ncur`; `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` where the conditions were met, in addition to any tuples of the form `(ncur, 1)` that were present initially. If no conditions were met at all, `piece` would remain 0, and `queue` would remain unchanged containing only the initial `(ncur, 0)` tuples.**
