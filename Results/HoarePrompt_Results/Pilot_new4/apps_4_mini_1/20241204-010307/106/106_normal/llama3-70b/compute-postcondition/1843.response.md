According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must be at least 1. Since it's given that `N` must be at least 4, this condition is satisfied. The variable `y` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop, but its value has not been initialized yet in the given state. Thus, it should be adjusted to reflect the beginning of the loop.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, piece)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0**
