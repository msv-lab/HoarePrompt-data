According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which represent the potential moves in the grid. For the loop to execute one more time, the values of `dx` and `dy` need to change to the next tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, the program state mentions that the piece is currently set to `2` and that `dist[1]` shows the shortest distances based on valid moves. The current direction tuple would have been processed, and now the loop is set to move to the next tuple.

Since the loop processes each direction in the order they appear in the list, if it has completed processing the first tuple `(-1, 0)`, it will proceed to the next one `(1, 0)`.

To summarize, considering the above information:
- The current state indicates `piece` is `2`, and the loop has just finished processing the first direction tuple. 
- For the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the values of `dx` and `dy` to the next direction.

Thus, the next state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `dx` and `dy` are now set to `(1, 0)`.

State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, piece is set to 2, and `dx, dy` are now `(1, 0)`**
