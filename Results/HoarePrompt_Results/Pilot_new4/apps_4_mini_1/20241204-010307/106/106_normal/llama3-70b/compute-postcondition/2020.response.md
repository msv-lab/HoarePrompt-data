The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are obtained by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. The conditions indicate that `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1, ensuring that the indexing into array `A` is valid. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances; `parent` reflects corresponding parents; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains (cur, i) if A[x][y] equals cur and piece is not equal to i; `dx` and `dy` will iterate through the 8 tuples in the list; `nx` is updated to `x + dx` and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
