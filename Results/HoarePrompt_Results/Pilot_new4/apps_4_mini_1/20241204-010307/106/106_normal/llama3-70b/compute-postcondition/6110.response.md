`ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is calculated as `x - 1` (which is `x + dx`), and `ny` is simply `y` (since `dy` is 0). The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `dx`, `dy`, and the conditions regarding `A` and `dist` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`.**
