Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
