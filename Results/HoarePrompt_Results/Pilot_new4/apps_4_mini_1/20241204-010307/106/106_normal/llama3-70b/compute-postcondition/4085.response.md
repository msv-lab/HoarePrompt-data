Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` and `dy` will take on all values from the list [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], `nx` and `ny` will have values based on the transformations applied, `ncur` may have been updated for valid `(nx, ny)` pairs within the bounds, `dist[1]` may contain updated distances for valid `ncur` values, `parent[1]` may store corresponding parents for those `ncur` values, and `queue` may contain tuples of updated `(ncur, 1)` for valid transitions; if no valid updates occur, `dist` and `parent` will remain unchanged.**
