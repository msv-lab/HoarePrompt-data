The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `1` and `-1`, respectively, which means `ncur` will be assigned the value of the element in the 2D array `A` at position `(1, -1)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]**
