According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent directional changes (`dx`, `dy`). Since the loop will iterate over all four possible directions, we need to track the current iteration state.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has completed one of the directional changes. Since there are four tuples in the list, the first iteration corresponds to the first tuple, the second to the second tuple, and so on. The loop will execute again until all tuples have been processed.

If we assume that the loop is currently on the first tuple `(-1, -1)` (iteration 0), then the next iteration will correspond to the second tuple `(-1, 1)` (iteration 1). Consequently, for the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple would need to be processed, and the state must be updated accordingly.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` and `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`; the iteration index is 1, and the current direction is `(-1, 1)`**
