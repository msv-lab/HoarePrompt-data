Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 2][2]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, no changes are made in the state of the program.***
