`ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and its current value is between 0 and `N`. The value of `ny` is 1, and it is also within the range of 0 to `N`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
