According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples in the list `[(−1,−1), (−1, 1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`, which means it will loop through each of these four pairs of `(dx, dy)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following states:
- `N` is at least 5.
- `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices.
- `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`.
- `piece` remains unchanged at 2.
- `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`.

The loop will execute once for each `(dx, dy)` pair, with the current state of `piece` being crucial to its functionality. After executing the loop body for the current `(dx, dy)` pair, if the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` is satisfied, `piece` may be updated to 1.

After the last iteration (which would have been for the last pair `(1, 1)`), there will not be any pairs left to iterate over. Therefore, to execute the loop for one more time, we need to consider that `dx` and `dy` must still point to the pairs in the list, ensuring that both `piece` is set to 2 (to allow for potential updates) and that the loop can be restarted.

Since the loop iterates through four pairs and the last iteration would have been for `(1, 1)`, the next execution of the loop would again start from the first pair `(-1, -1)`.

State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, and `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`, `dx` and `dy` is reset back to (-1, -1)**.
