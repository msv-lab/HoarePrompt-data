The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are known (`x` is 1 and `y` is 2), but the values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `1 + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `2 + dy`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `piece` is the same**.
