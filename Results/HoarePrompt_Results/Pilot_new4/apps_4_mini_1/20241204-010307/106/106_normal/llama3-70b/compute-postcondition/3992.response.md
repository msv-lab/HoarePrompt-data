The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The calculation is as follows:

- `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, which means `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`.
- `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`, which means `ny = 0 + 1 = 1`.

After executing the code, the values of `nx` and `ny` are updated. The conditions regarding their bounds (`0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`) will now involve `nx` being `-1`, which does not satisfy the condition for `nx`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][1]`.**
