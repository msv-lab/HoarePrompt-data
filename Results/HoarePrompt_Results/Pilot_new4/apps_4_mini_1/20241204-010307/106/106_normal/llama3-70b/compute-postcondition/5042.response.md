According to the code, the loop will iterate over the specified tuples in the list `[(dx, dy) for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]]`. This means that it will execute for each of the four tuples. 

Since the end of the previous iteration has `x` as 3, the loop would have started with the first tuple `(-1, -1)` and gone through all four tuples. The current iteration would have been the last one, which corresponds to the last tuple `(1, 1)`.

To execute one more time, the loop needs to cover another iteration, which is not possible with the given tuples as they are all defined and there are no more tuples to iterate over. Thus, there would be no change to the loop state.

State: **`If N is between 4 and 10, x is 3, y is 0, 0 <= nx < N, nx is 2, ny is -1, piece is 1, dist[1][ncur] is greater than dist[1][cur] + 1, ncur is not assigned a valid value, queue contains (None, 1)`**
