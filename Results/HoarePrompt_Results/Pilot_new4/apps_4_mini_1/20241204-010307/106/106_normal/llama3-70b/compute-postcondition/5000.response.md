The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D list `A` at the position determined by `nx` and `ny`. The `nx` is calculated as `3 + dx` and `ny` is calculated as `0 + dy`, and it is confirmed that these values are within bounds of the grid defined by `N` and `M`. Therefore, `ncur` will hold the value `A[nx][ny]`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is `3 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions; `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` contains all valid tuples; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.
