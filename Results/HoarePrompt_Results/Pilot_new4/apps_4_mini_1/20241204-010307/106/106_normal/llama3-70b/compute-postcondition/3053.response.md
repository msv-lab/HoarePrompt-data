Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to the `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
