The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined such that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. Since both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, we can assume that `A[nx][ny]` is a valid index access and thus `ncur` will be set to a valid value from the matrix `A`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` are valid, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` entries, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` are valid, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` entries, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`.**
