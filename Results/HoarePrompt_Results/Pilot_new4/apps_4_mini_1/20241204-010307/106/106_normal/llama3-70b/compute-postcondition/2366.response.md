According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `3`, meaning it will execute for `i` values from `0` to `2` inclusive. The current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration must be `2`, since it is the last value before the loop would terminate.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` would need to be `3`, which is the next value in the range; however, the loop is limited to iterate only for three values (`0`, `1`, and `2`). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to state that the range must include `3`, so `i` cannot be `3` as it would exceed the defined range.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that the loop cannot execute again. The values for `dist` and `parent` remain as they are because they are initialized only if the loop does not execute, and `queue` is already empty.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point for each piece type, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for each `piece`, and `queue` is empty.**
