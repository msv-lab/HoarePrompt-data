The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this means that the condition holds, and the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` will now equal `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the last element of the tuple, `dy` is the last second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N` (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `N`), `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
