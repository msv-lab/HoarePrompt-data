According to the code, the loop is defined to iterate over a predefined list of tuples, each representing a pair of values (dx, dy). The execution of the loop does not depend on any external variable states like `N`, `x`, or `y`. Instead, it is entirely driven by the hardcoded list of pairs.

Since this list is fixed and contains 8 pairs, the loop will execute regardless of the values of `N`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the states of `N`, `x`, and `y` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2**
