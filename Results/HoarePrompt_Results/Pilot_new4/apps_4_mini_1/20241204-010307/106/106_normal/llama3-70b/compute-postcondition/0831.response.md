Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[0]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values; `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid moves; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`; `current value of dist[1][cur]` is still valid.**
