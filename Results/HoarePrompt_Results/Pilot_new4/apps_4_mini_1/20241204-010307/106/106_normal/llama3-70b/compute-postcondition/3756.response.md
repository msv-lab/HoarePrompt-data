In the provided code, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given the initial state, `nx` is 3 and `ny` is 0. Therefore, the value of `ncur` will now be equal to `A[3][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` set to `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[3][0]`.**
