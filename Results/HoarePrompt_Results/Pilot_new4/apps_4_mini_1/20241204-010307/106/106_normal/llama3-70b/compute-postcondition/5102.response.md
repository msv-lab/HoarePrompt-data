The variables `nx` and `ny` are reassigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, thus we cannot determine the specific new values for `nx` and `ny`. 

The only affected variables are `nx` and `ny`, which are now dependent on the unknown `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `3 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
