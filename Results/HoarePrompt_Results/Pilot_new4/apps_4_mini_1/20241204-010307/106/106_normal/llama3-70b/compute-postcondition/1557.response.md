The variables `nx` and `ny` are being assigned values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine specific values for `nx` and `ny`. The initial variables remain unchanged, and the only change is that `nx` and `ny` are now defined, but their exact values depend on `dx` and `dy`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is defined as `2 + dx`, `ny` is defined as `2 + dy`**
