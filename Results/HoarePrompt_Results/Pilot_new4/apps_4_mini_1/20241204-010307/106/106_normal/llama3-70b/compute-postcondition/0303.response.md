The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which is the element of the array `A` at the indices `(nx, ny)`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and that both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), the assignment of `ncur` will retrieve a valid value from the array `A`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updated value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N)**.
