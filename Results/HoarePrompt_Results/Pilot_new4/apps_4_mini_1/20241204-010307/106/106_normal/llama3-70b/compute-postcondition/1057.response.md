According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `y` in the range from 0 to `N-1`. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, this means that `y` will take on values starting from 0 up to 9 (but not including 10). 

Before the loop starts, `y` is already in the range of 0 to N-1 inclusive, which means it can take a valid value for the first iteration. 

However, since the loop will iterate  `N` times, we will need to ensure that `y` starts at 0 for the first iteration. 

The states to be adjusted are:
1. `y` should be initialized to 0 since the loop will start iterating from this value.
2. We know `N` is between 3 and 10, so it will ensure that the loop executes at least for 3 iterations.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are as follows:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest path distances from the starting position for all valid reachable `ncur` values, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, `queue` includes all reachable tuples derived from the iterations.**
