The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the new values based on the calculations from `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The value of `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and the value of `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. The other variables remain unchanged, so we will indicate the ranges and values for them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.**
