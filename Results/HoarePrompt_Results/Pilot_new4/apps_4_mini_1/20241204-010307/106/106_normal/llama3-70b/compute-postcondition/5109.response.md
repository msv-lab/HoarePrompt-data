Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions updated based on valid moves, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` contains all valid tuples generated during the iterations, and if `piece` is 0, it indicates that the conditions for updating distances were satisfied at least once during the loop execution. If no valid moves were found during any iteration, `dist` remains unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
