Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables. If the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, no changes occur in the variables.***
