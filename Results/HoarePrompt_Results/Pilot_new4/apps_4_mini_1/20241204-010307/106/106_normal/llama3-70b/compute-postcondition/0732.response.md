Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid positions reachable based on the original `x` and `y`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the predecessor positions in the path, and `queue` contains all reachable positions `(ncur, 0)` where `piece` equals 0 and valid updates occurred. If no updates were made, `dist[0][ncur]` remains unchanged for positions that were not reachable.**
