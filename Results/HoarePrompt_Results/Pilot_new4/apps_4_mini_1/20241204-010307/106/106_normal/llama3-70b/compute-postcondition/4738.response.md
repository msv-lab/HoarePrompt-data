Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is defined, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` and both `nx` and `ny` are less than `N`.***
