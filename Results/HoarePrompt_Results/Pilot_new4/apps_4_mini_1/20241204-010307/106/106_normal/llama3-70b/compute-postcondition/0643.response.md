The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. Since the values of `ncur` and `0` are being added to `queue`, we need to maintain all previous variable states and reflect this change.

The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, which is already defined in the initial state. The variable `queue` is updated to include this new element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` has been updated to include `(ncur, 0)`**.
