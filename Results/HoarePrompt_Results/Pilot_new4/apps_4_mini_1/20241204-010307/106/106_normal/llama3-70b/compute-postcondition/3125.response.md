The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are both within the bounds of `0` and `N-1` (since `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`), and thus `A[nx][ny]` is a valid reference in the array `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the last valid `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` pairs added during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
