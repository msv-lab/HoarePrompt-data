The `queue` variable is now updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the affected variables.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position; `parent[1]` contains the parent positions; `piece` is equal to 2; `cur` is the current position; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x][y + 1]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
