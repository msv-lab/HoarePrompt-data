Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dist[2]` is updated for all reachable `ncur` indices from the initial position based on the distance from `cur`. `parent[2]` contains tuples of the previous indices leading to each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains tuples of all valid moves `(ncur, 2)` for each update made during the iterations. If no valid moves were possible, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
