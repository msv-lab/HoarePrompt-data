The line of code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the `parent` array at the indices `[2][ncur]`. The other variables' states remain unaffected. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, and thus `parent[2][ncur]` is now updated to contain the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
