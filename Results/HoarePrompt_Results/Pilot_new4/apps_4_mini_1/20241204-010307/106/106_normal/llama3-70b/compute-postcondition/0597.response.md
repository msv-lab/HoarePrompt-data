Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, and `piece` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 2)`, thereby maintaining the conditions of the precondition. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not satisfied, no updates occur.***
