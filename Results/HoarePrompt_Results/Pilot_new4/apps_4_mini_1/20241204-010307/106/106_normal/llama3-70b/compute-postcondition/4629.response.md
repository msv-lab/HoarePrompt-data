The line of code `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` based on the previous distance value at `dist[2][cur]`. The exact values of `dist[2][cur]`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `ncur` depend on the current state of the program and the contents of the array `dist` and variable `cur`. 

The variable `dist[2][ncur]` gets assigned a new value, which is `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

The output state will indicate the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` while the other variables remain unchanged in their previous conditions. However, since we do not know the specific values of `cur` and `ncur`, we just describe the change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
