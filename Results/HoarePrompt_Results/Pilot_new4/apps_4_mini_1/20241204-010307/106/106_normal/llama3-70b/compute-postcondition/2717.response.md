In the given code snippet, `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. This operation does not alter the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged, but the `queue` will now contain one additional tuple.

Since `cur` and `i` are variables that were not given specific values, we will keep them as they are for the output state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the final y-coordinate possibly updated based on valid moves, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` now contains tuples including `(cur, i)` for the valid moves, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
