Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `-1 + dy`; `piece` remains equal to 2; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`; otherwise, no changes occur to these variables.***
