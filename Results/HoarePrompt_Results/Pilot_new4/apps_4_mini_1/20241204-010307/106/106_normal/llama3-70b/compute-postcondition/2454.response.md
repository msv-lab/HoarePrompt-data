Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances calculated from `cur` for all valid `ncur` reached from `(x, y)`; `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the previous state leading to `ncur` for all valid `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 2)` for all valid `ncur` values that were updated. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
