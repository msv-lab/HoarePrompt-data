The code updates the value at `dist[0][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. However, since `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to `nx` being out of range, the assignment to `dist[0][ncur]` cannot be executed. As a result, no changes occur to the `dist` array or any other variables. All other preconditions remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value, `piece` is equal to 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
