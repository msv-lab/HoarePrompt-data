The code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` along with `piece`. The variable `cur` is already defined in the initial state, but we do not have its specific value. As such, we will not change `cur` or `piece`, as they are not modified. The other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to the `parent` array. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
