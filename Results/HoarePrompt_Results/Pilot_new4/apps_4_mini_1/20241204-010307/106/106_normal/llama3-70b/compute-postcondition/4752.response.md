Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
