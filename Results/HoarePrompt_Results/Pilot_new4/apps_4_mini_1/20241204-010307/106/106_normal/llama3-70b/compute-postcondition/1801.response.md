According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing direction changes for `dx` and `dy`. In the last iteration, `dy` was 1 and `dx` was -1. The loop will execute again for the next tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1. The next tuple in the list is `(1, -1)`, which means at the start of the next iteration, `dx` will be 1 and `dy` will be -1. The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged unless affected by the loop body, which we do not know about since itâ€™s omitted.

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `dx` and `dy` will change according to the next tuple in the list, while other states remain the same.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 3, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
