The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is 0 and `ny` is 3, `ncur` will reflect the value of the 0th row and 3rd column of the matrix `A`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is A[0][3].**
