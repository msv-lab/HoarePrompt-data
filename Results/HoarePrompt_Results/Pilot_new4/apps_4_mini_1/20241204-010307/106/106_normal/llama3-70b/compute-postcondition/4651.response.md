Let's analyze the provided code snippet.

1. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is equal to 1.
2. The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`.
3. `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`. Given that `dx` is -2, this means `nx = x - 2`.
4. `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. Since `y` is 2 and `dy` is 1, this means `ny = 2 + 1 = 3`.

Now, let's update the output state with the new values:

- `nx` retains the expression `x - 2`.
- `ny` now has the value 3.

The other variables `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy` remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 3.**
