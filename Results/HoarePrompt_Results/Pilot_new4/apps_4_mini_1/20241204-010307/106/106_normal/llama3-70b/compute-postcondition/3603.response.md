According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute for each of these tuples, and since there are 8 tuples, the index of the current tuple in the loop will be between `0` and `7`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific tuple `(dx, dy)` currently being processed in the loop. 

Since the loop is processing pairs of `dx` and `dy`, we need to consider that the loop will execute one more time if there are more tuples available in the list. After the last iteration, the loop index would have incremented. To allow for one more iteration, we need to account for the current index in the list of tuples, which will be `8` after all tuples have been processed.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
1. The loop will not execute if all tuples have been processed, so we need to ensure that the current index remains within the bounds of the list.
2. The loop will increment `dx` and `dy`, and maintain the other existing states.

Thus, the only requirement is that the loop index remains within the range of available tuples, which it will reset once it starts from the beginning again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the loop index is reset to `0` for the next full iteration of the tuples.**
