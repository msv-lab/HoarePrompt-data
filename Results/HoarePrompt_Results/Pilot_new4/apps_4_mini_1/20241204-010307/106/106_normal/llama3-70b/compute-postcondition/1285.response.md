According to the code, the loop will execute for each direction specified in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. This means that the loop will iterate four times, once for each tuple representing a direction (up, down, left, right). Since the loop itself does not depend on any variables being initialized to particular values before execution, it is primarily concerned with the conditions that need to be checked within the loop body.

The relevant states to consider for the execution of the loop are:
1. The values of `nx` and `ny` must be calculated based on `x` and `y` as well as the current direction deltas `dx` and `dy`.
2. It is important to ensure that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` to determine if the new positions `(nx, ny)` are valid.

Currently, we know that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `x` is 1 and `y` is 2.

For the loop to execute and check conditions, we just need to ensure that the positions calculated from the current `x` and `y` using the deltas are valid positions.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, position `(nx, ny)` will be calculated as `(x + dx, y + dy)` for each delta, and must satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` for valid updates.**
