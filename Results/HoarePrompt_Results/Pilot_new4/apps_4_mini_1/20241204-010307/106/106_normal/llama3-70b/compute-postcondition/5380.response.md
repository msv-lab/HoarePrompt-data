Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `queue` includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1` if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
