The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the list `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables include `ncur` which is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `queue` is extended by adding a new element. The values of `N`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes a tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
