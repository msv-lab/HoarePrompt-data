The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y` as well as the values in `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` can take on any of the pairs [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], which will affect the calculation of `nx` and `ny`. 

Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, the potential values for `nx` and `ny` will be:

1. If `dx = -1` and `dy = -1`:  
   - `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`  
   - `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`

2. If `dx = -1` and `dy = 1`:  
   - `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`  
   - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

3. If `dx = 1` and `dy = -1`:  
   - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`  
   - `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`

4. If `dx = 1` and `dy = 1`:  
   - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`  
   - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

Since `dx` and `dy` could take on any one of these pairs, `nx` and `ny` will have multiple potential outcomes. However, the values of `N`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1 or 1, `ny` is 0, 2, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances calculated, `parent[0]` reflects the parents of the nodes, `queue` may contain valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `dx` and `dy` will take on values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]**
