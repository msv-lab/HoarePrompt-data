Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y + 1]`, if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the previous tuples plus the newly added tuple `(ncur, 1)`.***
