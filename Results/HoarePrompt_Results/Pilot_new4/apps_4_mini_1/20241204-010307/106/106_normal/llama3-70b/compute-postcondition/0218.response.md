The statement `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions, along with the new state of the `queue`, which now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `x` is a valid integer within bounds; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `dist[1][ncur]` is not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
