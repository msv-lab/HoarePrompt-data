The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`, which is derived from the variables `cur` and `piece`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged since the operation does not modify them, only the assignment is made.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the new assignment for `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
