Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the variables. If the condition is not met, no changes occur.***
