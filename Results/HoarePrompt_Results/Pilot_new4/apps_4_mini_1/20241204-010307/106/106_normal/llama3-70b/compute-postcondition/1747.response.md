The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, and the other variables also retain their previous values. The `queue` is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
