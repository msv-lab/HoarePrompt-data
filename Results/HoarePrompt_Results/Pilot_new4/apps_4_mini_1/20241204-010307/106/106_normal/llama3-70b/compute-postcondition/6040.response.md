Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dist[0][ncur]`, `dist[1][ncur]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` contain the minimum distances from `cur` for each valid `ncur` based on the movements defined by the pieces. `parent[0][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` reflect the previous positions and states of `piece` for each valid `ncur`. The `queue` contains all tuples of `(ncur, piece)` for which the distance conditions were satisfied throughout all iterations, and `piece` may have been updated based on the conditions met during execution. If no conditions were met, `piece` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
