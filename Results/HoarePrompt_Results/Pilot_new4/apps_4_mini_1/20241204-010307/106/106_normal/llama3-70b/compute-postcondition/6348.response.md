The code assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. The values of `dist`, `cur`, and `ncur` will change accordingly. The `dist[1][ncur]` will be updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`, and since `cur` is equal to `A[0][0]`, the specific value of `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][A[0][0]] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` is updated accordingly for the next iteration, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
