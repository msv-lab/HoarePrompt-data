Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `ncur` are updated during the loop execution.***
