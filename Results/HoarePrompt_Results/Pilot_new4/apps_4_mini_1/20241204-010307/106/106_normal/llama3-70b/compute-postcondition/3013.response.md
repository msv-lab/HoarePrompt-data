Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist` may be updated based on reachable positions, `parent` may be updated accordingly, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
