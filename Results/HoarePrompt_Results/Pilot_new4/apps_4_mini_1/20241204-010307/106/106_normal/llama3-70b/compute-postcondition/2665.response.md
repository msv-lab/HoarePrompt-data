The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, and both are guaranteed to be within the bounds of the grid. Therefore, the value of `ncur` will be determined by the value at position `(nx, ny)` in the array `A`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move generated by `dx` and `dy`, `parent[0][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
