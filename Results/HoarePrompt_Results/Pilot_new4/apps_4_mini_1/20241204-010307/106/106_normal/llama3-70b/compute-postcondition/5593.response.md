Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
