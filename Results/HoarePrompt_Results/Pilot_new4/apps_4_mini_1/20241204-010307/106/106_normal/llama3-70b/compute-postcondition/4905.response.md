Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `dist[2]` may have been updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution; `parent[2]` contains the parent positions corresponding to the updated `dist[2]`; if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` now contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` positions along with the appended tuple `(cur, i)`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged.***
