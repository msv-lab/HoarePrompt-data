Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` now contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
