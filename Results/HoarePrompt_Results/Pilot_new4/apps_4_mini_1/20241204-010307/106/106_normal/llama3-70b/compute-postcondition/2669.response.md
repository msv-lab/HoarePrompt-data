The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are not altered by this operation, and no other variables are affected. The state of `queue` is updated to include the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][cur]` is less than `dist[1][ncur]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, 1`.**
