In the provided code snippet, the operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer `0` to the list `queue`. 

Before this operation:
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`.
- The other variables (`N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `parent[0][ncur]`) remain unchanged.

After the operation:
- `queue` will have an additional entry which is the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. 

Since the specific value of `ncur` is derived from the matrix `A` at the index `nx` with column `0`, we leave it as `ncur` in our output state. 

Therefore, the Output State is as follows, preserving all the unchanged variables and noting the addition to `queue`:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
