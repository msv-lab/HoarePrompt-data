Postcondition: ***`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) with `(cur, i)` appended to `queue` if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is equal to 0 while the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
