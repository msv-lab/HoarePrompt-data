Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables. If the conditions are not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
