Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `piece` is updated to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains all processed tuples including the tuple (ncur, 2) if `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes occur in `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
