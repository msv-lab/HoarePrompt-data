The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` have been updated to `0 + dx` and `0 + dy`, respectively. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on `dx` and `dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is updated to `dx`, `ny` is updated to `dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is updated to `dx`, `ny` is updated to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`**.
