Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[0][ncur]` continues to represent the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`; `parent[0][ncur]` holds updated parent positions; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
