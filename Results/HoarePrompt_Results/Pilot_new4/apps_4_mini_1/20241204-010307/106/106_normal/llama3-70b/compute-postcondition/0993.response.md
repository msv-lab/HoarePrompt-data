The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is previously defined as `A[2][3]`, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][3]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` has an additional element `(ncur, 0)` appended.**
