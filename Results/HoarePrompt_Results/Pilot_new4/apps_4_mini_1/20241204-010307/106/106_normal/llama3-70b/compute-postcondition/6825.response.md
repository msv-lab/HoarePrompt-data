Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]` contains the updated distances for all reachable valid positions from (1, 1), `parent[2]` contains predecessors for valid positions, and `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
