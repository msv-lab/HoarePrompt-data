Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` is less than `dist[2][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, with `queue` including the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
