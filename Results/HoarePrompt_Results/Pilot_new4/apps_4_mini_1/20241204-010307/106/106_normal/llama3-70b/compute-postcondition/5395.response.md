Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is A[3][0]. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
