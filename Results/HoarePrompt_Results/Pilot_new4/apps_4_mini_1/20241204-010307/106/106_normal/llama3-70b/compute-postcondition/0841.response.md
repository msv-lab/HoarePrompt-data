Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is added to the `queue`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the variables.***
