The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state but `piece` is equal to 1. Therefore, the values of `parent[1][ncur]` will be updated with the current value of `cur` and the value of `piece` which is 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list of tuples for possible moves, `ncur` is valid for `dist` updates when `piece` is 0, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`.**
