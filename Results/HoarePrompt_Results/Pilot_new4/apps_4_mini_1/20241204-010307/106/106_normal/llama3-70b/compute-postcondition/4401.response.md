The code `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` (where `ny` is `N + dy`). The other variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `A`, `dist`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.**
