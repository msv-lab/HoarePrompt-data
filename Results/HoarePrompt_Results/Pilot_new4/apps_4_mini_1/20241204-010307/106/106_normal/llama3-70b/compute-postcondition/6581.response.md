The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the expressions `1 + dx` and `0 + dy` respectively. The value of `N` is still between 3 and 10, and the states of `x`, `y`, `index`, and `A` remain unchanged. However, since `ncur` is being assigned, we now have a derived state for it.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `index` is 0, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
