The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided, but the variables `ncur` and `parent[1][...]` have now been updated.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the previous state does not change in regard to the defined ranges. The Output State reflects the updates made to `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
