In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not defined in the initial state provided, but we know that `ny` is determined by adding `dy` to `y`, and `nx` is determined by adding `dx` to `x`. The variables `N`, `ncur`, and any other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` for the next pair.**
