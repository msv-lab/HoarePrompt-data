To analyze the given code, we first need to understand the variables involved and their relationships.

Given:
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `x` is `dx`.
- `y` is `dy`.
- `dx` is -1.
- `dy` is 0.
- `nx` is -2.
- `ny` is 0.
- `ncur` is `A[-2][0]`.

The code snippet:
```
dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables Affected**:
   - The code affects the `dist` array at the indices `2` and `ncur`.

2. **Determine the Value of `ncur`**:
   - `ncur` is defined as `A[-2][0]`. This value is not directly provided, but we will keep it as `ncur`.

3. **Existing Values**:
   - The value `dist[2][ncur]` will be updated based on the current value of `dist[2][cur]`. 

4. **Update Logic**:
   - `dist[2][ncur]` will now hold the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

5. **Variables Not Directly Affected**:
   - The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`) retain their values since the code does not modify them.

### Output State:
The output will include the unchanged values of the variables and the updated state of `dist`, specifically noting that `dist[2][ncur]` is now `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[-2][0]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
