The code assigns values to the `parent` array. The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is set to a combination of the values of `cur` and `piece`. The preconditions that remain valid are `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is equal to `1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
