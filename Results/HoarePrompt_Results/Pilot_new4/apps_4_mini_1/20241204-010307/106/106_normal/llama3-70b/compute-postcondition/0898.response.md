The line `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns `cur` and `piece` to the respective position in the `parent` array at index `[0][ncur]`. This modifies the `parent` array without affecting the values of other variables. The previous values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are used in this assignment.

Since there are no calculations performed that change the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, or `ncur`, these variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the first tuple, `dy` is the second element of the first tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][1 + dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the first tuple, `dy` is the second element of the first tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][1 + dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned `cur, piece`.**
