Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples including `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
