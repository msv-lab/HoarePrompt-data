The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Since `nx` is -1 and `ny` is -2, this access attempts to retrieve a value from `A` at an invalid index (as it goes out of the bounds of the array). However, based on the initial state, we do not have information about what happens when an invalid index is accessed. Therefore, we can't provide a specific result for `ncur`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Thus, the output state maintains all the previous values, but the value of `ncur` is unspecified due to the invalid index access.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -2, and `ncur` is unspecified due to invalid index access.**
