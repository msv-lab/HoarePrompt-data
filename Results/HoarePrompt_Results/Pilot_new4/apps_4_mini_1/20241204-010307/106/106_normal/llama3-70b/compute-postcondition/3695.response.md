The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` means that the value at `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be one more than the value at `dist[0][cur]`. However, we do not have the values of `cur` or `dist` provided in the initial state. 

We know that `ncur` is determined by the expression `A[nx][ny]`, but without specific values for `A`, `cur`, or `dist`, we cannot determine the exact changes. The only information we can confirm is that `dist[0][ncur]` will be assigned a value that is one greater than `dist[0][cur]`.

Thus, summarizing the state after this assignment while acknowledging the lack of details about `cur` and `dist`:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `piece` is 0; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
