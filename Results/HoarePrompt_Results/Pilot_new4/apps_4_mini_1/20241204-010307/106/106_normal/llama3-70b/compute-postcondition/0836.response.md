The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The previously stated conditions remain valid. The values of `x` and `y` are still 0, while `nx` and `ny` are calculated from those zeros added to `dx` and `dy`. 

Therefore, `nx` becomes `0 + dx` and `ny` becomes `0 + dy`. 

The Output State reflects this:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`.**
