Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves; `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` and `piece` is 2. If `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, 2)`.***
