Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
