The code assigns the new values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the increments `dx` and `dy`. The variable `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, which equals `x + 1`, and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, which equals `y + 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1**.
