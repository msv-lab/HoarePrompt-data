The line `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the distances for the reachable indices. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` is equal to `x + dx`. The effect of this operation means that the specific value of `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated based on the current distance at `cur` plus 1.

Since `dist`, `piece`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, we only need to update the value at `dist[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to 5, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
