According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of `dx` and `dy` values, and the loop will execute for each of these pairs. At the end of the last iteration, the loop must check the next pair in the list. The current pair is `(-1, 1)` since the last executed pair before this iteration was `(-1, -1)`. 

The pairs in the list are: 
1. `(-1, -1)`
2. `(-1, 1)`
3. `(1, -1)`
4. `(1, 1)`

After executing with `(-1, 1)`, the loop will then proceed to `(1, -1)` for the next iteration. 

Thus, there will be two adjustments needed:
1. The current pair of `dx` and `dy` will change to `(1, -1)`.
2. The loop will continue until all pairs are processed.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` and `dy` must be updated to the next pair in the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1**
