The value of `queue` is updated by appending the tuple `(cur, i)`. The other variables remain unchanged as the operation only modifies the `queue`. The states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, and `parent` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[2]` contains potential updated distances for valid cells, `parent[2]` contains corresponding parents for valid cells, `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(cur, i)`**.
