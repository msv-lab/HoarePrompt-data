Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1]` tracks the previous position and piece, `queue` must contain at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
