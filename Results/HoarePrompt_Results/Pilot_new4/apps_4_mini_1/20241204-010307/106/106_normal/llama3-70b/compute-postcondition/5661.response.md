Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `(nx, ny)` position found; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is the last computed value from `x + dx` for the last iteration; `ny` is the last computed value from `y + dy` for the last iteration; `ncur` is the last computed value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[1][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`; if no valid positions were found, `queue` remains unchanged, `dist` and `parent` would not be updated for `ncur`.**
