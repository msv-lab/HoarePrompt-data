Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` remains unchanged, and a tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is not satisfied, no operations occur.***
