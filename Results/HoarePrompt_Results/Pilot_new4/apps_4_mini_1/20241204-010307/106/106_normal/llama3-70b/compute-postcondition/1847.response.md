Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, piece)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N).***
