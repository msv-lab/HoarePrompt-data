The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are involved in this assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
