In this code snippet, `queue` is modified by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `1`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

The state of the variables becomes:
- `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` in addition to its previous elements.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes `ncur` along with previous elements and `(ncur, 1)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
