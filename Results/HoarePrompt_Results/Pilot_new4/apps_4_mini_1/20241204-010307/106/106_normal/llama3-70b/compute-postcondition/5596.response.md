The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The previous values are `nx` equal to `x + 1` and `ny` equal to `y`. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, the variables related to `A` are not specified, but we will keep the conditions related to `N` intact. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; the next (dx, dy) will be (1, 0).

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; the next (dx, dy) will be (1, 0)**.
