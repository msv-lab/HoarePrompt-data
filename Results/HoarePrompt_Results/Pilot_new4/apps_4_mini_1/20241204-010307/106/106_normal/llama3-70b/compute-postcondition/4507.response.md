To analyze the impact of the code, we need to focus on what the line `ncur = A[nx][ny]` does in the context of the given initial state.

1. **Identify the variables affected:**
   - `ncur` is assigned a new value based on the content of the 2D array `A` at indices `[nx][ny]`.
   - This assignment will change the value of `ncur` based on the calculated values of `nx` and `ny`.

2. **Determine the values of `nx` and `ny`:**
   - From the initial state, we know that `nx` is defined as `x - 1`.
   - `ny` is defined as `y + 1`.
   - Given that `y` is `0`, we can say `ny` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - The value of `nx` will depend on the current value of `x`, which is not provided in the initial state.

3. **Final calculation for `ncur`:**
   - Since `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, the value of `ncur` will be determined by `A[nx][ny]`, which translates to `A[x - 1][1]`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `ncur` is now dependent on the specific state of `A` at `A[x - 1][1]`, and we cannot determine this value without additional information about `A`.
   - However, we note that this assignment updates `ncur`, and we will keep the rest of the variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples and potentially now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`.**
