The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the computations `nx = x + dx` and `ny = 1 + dy`. Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is an integer within the range `0 <= x < N`, and `y` is 1, `nx` and `ny` will have specific values based on `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, since the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine `ncur`'s exact value but know that `nx` will be in the range `[0 + dx, N - 1 + dx]` and `ny` will be `1 + dy`.

The values of `A`, `piece`, and `dist` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` and `dist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` and `dist` remain unchanged.**
