Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, and `ncur` is `A[1][3]`. If `nx` is between 0 and `N-1` (inclusive) and `ny` is also between 0 and `N-1` (inclusive), and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` is assigned to `parent[1][ncur]`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is added to the `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
