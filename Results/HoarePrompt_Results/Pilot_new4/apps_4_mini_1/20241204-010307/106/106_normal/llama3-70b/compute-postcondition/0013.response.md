The variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state provided, but they are implied to represent directional movements (e.g., offsets for moving in a grid). Assuming that these variables are defined and represent valid movements, the calculation `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` will impact the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Since `x` is currently 0 and `y` is currently 0, the new values of `nx` and `ny` will solely depend on the values of `dx` and `dy` after the execution of the code.

- If `dx` and `dy` are defined as valid movements (e.g., `dx` could be 1 for right movement, and `dy` could be 0 for no vertical movement), then:
  - For example, if `dx = 1` and `dy = 0`, then `nx` will be `0 + 1 = 1` and `ny` will be `0 + 0 = 0`.
  - For `dx = 0` and `dy = 1`, `nx` will remain `0` and `ny` will become `1`.

As the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot derive exact values for `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, we can only state that `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `cur` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][1]` is 0, `dist` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to float('inf'), `parent` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to None, `queue` is empty, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur` (which is 1), `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
