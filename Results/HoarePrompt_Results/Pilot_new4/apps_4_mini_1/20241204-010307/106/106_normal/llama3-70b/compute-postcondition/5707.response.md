The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The `dist` array's value at `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The impact of this code means that `dist[0][ncur]` will now be a value that is one greater than the current `dist[0][cur]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
