Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0 plus the new tuple `(A[1][3], 1)`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is `A[1][3]`; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`; otherwise, no updates are made.***
