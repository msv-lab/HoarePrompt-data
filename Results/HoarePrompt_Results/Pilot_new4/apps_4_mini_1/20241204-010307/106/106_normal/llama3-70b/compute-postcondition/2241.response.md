The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the value of `parent[1][ncur]` to a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `piece`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are not mentioned; however, we know that `piece` is 0. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`piece` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y - 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)`**.
