The value of `ncur` is calculated as `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is then assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change except for `dist[2][ncur]`, which is updated based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`; `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`; `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
