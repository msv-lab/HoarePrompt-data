The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous state of the variables does not change except for `parent[1][ncur]`, which now holds the values of `cur` and `piece`.

The variables remain defined as follows:
- `N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`
- `y` is equal to `N`
- `nx` is `x + dx`
- `ny` is `y + dy`
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`

Therefore, the output state reflects the update in `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
