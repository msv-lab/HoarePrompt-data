According to the code, the loop iterates over a fixed set of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. Each iteration will take the next tuple from this set. Given that there are 8 tuples in the list, the loop will execute 8 times in total.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1 for the current iteration. To execute the loop one more time, the next tuple in the list will be selected. The next tuple after `(-2, -1)` in the list is `(-2, 1)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be updated to reflect the next values of `dx` and `dy`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`.**
