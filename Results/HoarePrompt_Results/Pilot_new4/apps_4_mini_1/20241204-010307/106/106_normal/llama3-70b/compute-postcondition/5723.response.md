Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0), `dist` must be initialized for `N` values, `parent` must be initialized for `N` values, `piece` must be defined before the loop, `ncur` is a valid index for `dist` and `parent` updates; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N` (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `N`).***
