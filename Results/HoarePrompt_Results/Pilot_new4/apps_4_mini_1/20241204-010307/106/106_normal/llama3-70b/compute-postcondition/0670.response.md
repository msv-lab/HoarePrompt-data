The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `ncur`, which is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, and the value `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][0]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
