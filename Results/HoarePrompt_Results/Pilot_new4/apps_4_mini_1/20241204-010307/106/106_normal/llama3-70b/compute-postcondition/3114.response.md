`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1, we can calculate `nx` and `ny`. 

Since `dx` is -1, `nx` becomes `x - 1`. 
Since `dy` is 1, `ny` becomes `y + 1`, which is 2 + 1 = 3. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: If `N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `x` is at least 1, `dx` and `dy` are the next values from the list which will be (-1, 1) for the next iteration; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 3.
