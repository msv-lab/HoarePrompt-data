The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the integer `1` remain as they are; no calculations or changes to other variables occur in this statement.

The initial state specifies that `ncur` has been previously assigned a value from `A[nx][ny]`, but that assignment does not affect the current operation, which simply appends to the queue.

The output state remains the same regarding the other variables, with the only change being that `queue` now contains an additional tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`**.
