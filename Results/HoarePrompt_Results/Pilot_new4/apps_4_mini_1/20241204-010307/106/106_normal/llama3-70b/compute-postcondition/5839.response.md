Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)` where all conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` were met; `piece` remains 0 for the tuples in `queue`; `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`; `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`; the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` and both are less than `N`.***
