Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and the queue contains the tuple (ncur, 1). Otherwise, no changes are made.***
