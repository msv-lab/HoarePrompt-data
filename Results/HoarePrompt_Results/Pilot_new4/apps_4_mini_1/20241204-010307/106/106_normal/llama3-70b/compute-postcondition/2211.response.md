The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` were `x - 2` and `y + 1`, respectively. After executing the code, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the updated parent at index `0` for `ncur`, which is now `cur`, `queue` contains two elements `[(cur, n + 1), (ncur, 0)]`, `nx` is now `x + dx`, `ny` is now `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, piece is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, now processing the second pair `(-2, 1)`**.
