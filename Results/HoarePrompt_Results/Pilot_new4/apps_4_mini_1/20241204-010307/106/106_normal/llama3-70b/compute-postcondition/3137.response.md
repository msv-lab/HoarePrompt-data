The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is still undefined; thus, it remains undefined after the operation. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `nx` is undefined, `ny` is undefined, `ncur` is undefined, `cur` is undefined, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
