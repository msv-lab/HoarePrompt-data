Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
