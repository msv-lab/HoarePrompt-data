Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is either -1 or 1; `ny` is either 0, 2, or both based on the combinations of `dx` and `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now contains `((ncur, 1),)`**.
