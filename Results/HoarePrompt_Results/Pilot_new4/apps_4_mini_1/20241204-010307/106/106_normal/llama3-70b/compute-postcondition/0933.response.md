The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to an entry in the `parent` list for the index `[1][ncur]`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, `dy`, and `dist[1][ncur]` remain unchanged in this operation, while `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to the values of `cur` and `piece`. The value of `ncur` is based on `A[-1][2]`, which is unknown, and it affects the specific entry in `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`.**
