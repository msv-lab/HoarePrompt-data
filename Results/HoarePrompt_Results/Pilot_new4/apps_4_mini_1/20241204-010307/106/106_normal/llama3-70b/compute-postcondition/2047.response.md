`ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are derived from the previous values of `x` combined with the values in the tuples `dx` and `dy`. This operation does not affect any other variables, and the existing conditions regarding `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `queue`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State will reflect the unchanged variables along with the newly assigned value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, `dx` and `dy` will take on values from the tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], `nx` is `x + dx` for each `dx` value, and `ny` is `y + dy` for each `dy` value, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
