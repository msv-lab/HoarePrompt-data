The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are relevant for this operation. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The previous values of the relevant variables:
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
- `queue` receives the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
