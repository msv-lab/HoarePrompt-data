The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Since it's stated that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, it will now become equal, indicating a new distance value calculated based on the current state. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
