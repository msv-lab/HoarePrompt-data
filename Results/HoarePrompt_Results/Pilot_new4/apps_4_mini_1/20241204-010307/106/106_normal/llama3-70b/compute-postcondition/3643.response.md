The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the arrays `dist` and `parent` remain unaffected by this operation. The state of the `queue` variable will now include a new element based on the current values of `ncur` and `1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now includes the element `(ncur, 1)`**.
