The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is 0 and `ny` is 3, `ncur` will now hold the value of `A[0][3]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
