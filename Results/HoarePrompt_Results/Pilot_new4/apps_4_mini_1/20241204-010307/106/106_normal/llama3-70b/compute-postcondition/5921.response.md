Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y - 1]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`; otherwise, no changes are made. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no actions are taken.***
