The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the specific values of `ncur` and `cur` are maintained based on the previous assignments. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is between 1 and 9; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.
