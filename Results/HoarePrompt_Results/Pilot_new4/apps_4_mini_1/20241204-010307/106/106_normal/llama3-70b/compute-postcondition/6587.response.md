According to the code, the loop iterates over a set of directional offsets `(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the directional offsets `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `x` is 1,
- `y` is 0,
- `index` is 0,
- `nx` is calculated as `1 + dx`,
- `ny` is calculated as `0 + dy`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to move to the next tuple `(dx, dy)` in the list of offsets, which means `index` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, the next values of `nx` and `ny` will be based on the next directional offset. Since the loop goes through eight offsets, and `index` is currently 0, the next index will be 1, corresponding to the second offset `(-2, 1)`.

Calculating `nx` and `ny` for the next iteration:
- For `dx = -2` and `dy = 1`, we have:
  - `nx = 1 + (-2) = -1`
  - `ny = 0 + 1 = 1`

We must also ensure the conditions for `nx` and `ny` hold. For the next iteration, `0 <= nx < N` (which requires `N > -1`) and `0 <= ny < N` (which requires `N > 1`) must be checked. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, both conditions are satisfied.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration will be:
State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `index` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1**
