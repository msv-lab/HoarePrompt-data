Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, if `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated according to the valid moves, `dist[2][ncur]` contains distances updated based on the conditions, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid `cur` and `piece` for those updates, and `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 2)`; if the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, the tuple `(cur, i)` is appended to `queue`, otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
