The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The possible values for `nx` and `ny` are constrained such that `nx` can be `x - 1` or `x + 1` and `ny` can be -1 or 1. Given that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the resulting values of `ncur` are dependent on the values of `A` at the valid indices `nx` and `ny`. 

The states of `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `x`, `nx`, and `ny` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, we will keep those variables in their original state while updating `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `x` is between 2 and N-1; `nx` can be `x - 1` or `x + 1`; `ny` can be -1 or 1 based on the pairs in `dx` and `dy`; 0 <= `nx` < `N`; 0 <= `ny` < `N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
