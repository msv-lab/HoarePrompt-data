According to the code, the loop iterates over the directional changes represented by the tuples in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. This means that for each iteration, the variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the values of each tuple in turn.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `piece` remains equal to 2, and `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`. The loop is dependent on the tuples in the list, and since there are 4 tuples, the loop will execute 4 times, once for each tuple.

At the conclusion of the last iteration, the current values of `dx` and `dy` will determine which tuple was used. The last tuple used in the iteration would be the fourth one `(0, 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, it will need to restart from the beginning of the list of tuples.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again are:
- `dx` would take the first value in the list, which is `-1`.
- `dy` would take the second value in the list, which is `0`.

The variables `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `piece` remain unchanged, and `N` also stays the same.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**.
