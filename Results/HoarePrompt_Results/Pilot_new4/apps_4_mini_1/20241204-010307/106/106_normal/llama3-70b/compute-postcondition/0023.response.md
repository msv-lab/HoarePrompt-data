The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since the `dx` value is -2 and the `dy` value is 1, we have:

- `nx = x + (-2) = x - 2`
- `ny = y + 1`

The initial state does not provide values for `x` and `y`, only that `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `piece` remains 0, and `cur` is set to 1 for the next iteration. The states of the other variables (`N`, `piece`, `cur`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `piece` remains 0, `cur` is set to 1 for the next iteration, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1**.
