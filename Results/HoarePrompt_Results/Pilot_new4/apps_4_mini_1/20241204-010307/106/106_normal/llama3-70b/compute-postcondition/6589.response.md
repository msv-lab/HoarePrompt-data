The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`. Here, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, and `index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignments made.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `index` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
