The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are retained. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 2, 2, 1, or 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
