Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values `(cur, piece)`, with `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remaining valid positions between 0 and N-1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
