The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `1` are used, but the value of `ncur` depends on the conditions provided in the initial state. The other variables `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`, `dist`, and `parent` are not affected directly by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the relevant precondition remains valid, and we note that `ncur` is determined by the expression involving `A[nx][ny]`, which is valid if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The `dist` and `parent` data are also established in the initial state but are not altered by this line of code.

Output State: **`dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`**.
