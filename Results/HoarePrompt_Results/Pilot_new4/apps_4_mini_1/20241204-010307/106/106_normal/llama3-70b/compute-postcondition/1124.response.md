The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the calculations `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0, we can compute:

- `nx = x + dx = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + 0 = 0`

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, and `ny` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0**.
