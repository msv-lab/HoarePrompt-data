The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `1 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, we need to note that both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to N-1 inclusive. This means their values depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, `queue` contains reachable positions, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, `queue` contains reachable positions, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
