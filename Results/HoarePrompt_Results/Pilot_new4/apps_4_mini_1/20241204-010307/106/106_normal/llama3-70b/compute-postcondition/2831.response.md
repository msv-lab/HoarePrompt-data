Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to `0` and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
