The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of the variables involved are not changed directly by this operation, but the state of the `queue` is updated.

The previous states of the variables remain valid, and the only change is that `ncur` is appended to `queue`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer such that `y` is less than `N` and has been incremented to `y + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur]` is still valid, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
