The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the value at index `[2][ncur]` in the `parent` array to a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece`. The initial states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, only the value of `parent[2][ncur]` is changed.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`**
