Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and if `nx` is within the range [0, N) and `ny` is within the range [0, N), then `nx` is updated to `dx`, `ny` is updated to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` may be updated based on the condition involving `dist[1][cur]` and `piece`, `parent[1][ncur]` may be set to `cur`, `piece` may be assigned, and `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
