Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `dist` is initialized for all valid positions, `parent` is initialized for all valid positions, `queue` is initialized to contain reachable positions from (1, 0), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and the distance from the current position to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the current position to `cur` plus 1.***
