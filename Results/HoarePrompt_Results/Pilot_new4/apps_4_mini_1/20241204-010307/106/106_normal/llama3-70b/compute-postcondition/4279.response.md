According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible movements represented by the pairs (dx, dy). The current values of `dx` and `dy` will change with each iteration, taking values from the list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] in order.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last pair in the list, which is (0, 1). Therefore, for the next iteration, `dx` will be adjusted to the first pair in the list, which is (-1, 0).

The state indicates that `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `x` is 1, and `y` is `N - 1`. The next values of `nx` and `ny` will be calculated based on the new `dx` and `dy` values.

After updating:
- `dx` will be -1, giving `nx = 1 + (-1) = 0`
- `dy` will be 0, giving `ny = (N - 1) + 0 = N - 1`

Given that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` will be 0 which is valid within the bounds of `0 <= nx < N`, and `ny` will still be valid as `0 <= N - 1 < N`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is 0, `ny` is `N - 1`, `ncur` is `A[0][N - 1]`**
