According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute `N` times, ranging from `x = 0` to `x = N-1`. The current state indicates `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, which means `N` is at least 3.

Before the loop starts, `cur` is set to 1 and `piece` holds the value of `i` from the popped tuple. Since the loop does not depend on `cur`, `piece`, or the contents of `dist` and `parent`, the conditions for the loop execution are solely based on `N`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0 for the first iteration**
