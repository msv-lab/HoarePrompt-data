The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is determined by `A[-1][0]`, and the values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, so we will maintain `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` as they are. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is A[-1][0]; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
