The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is -1, we can calculate the new values as follows:

- `nx` becomes `x + dx`, which is `0 + (-2) = -2`.
- `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which is `0 + (-1) = -1`.

The values of `N`, `cur`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged, as well as any other unaffected variables. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.**
