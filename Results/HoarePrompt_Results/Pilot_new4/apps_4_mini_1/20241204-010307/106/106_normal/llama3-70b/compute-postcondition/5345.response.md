In the code snippet provided, `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, as well as the offsets `dx` and `dy`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 4 and 10, which does not directly affect the values of `nx` and `ny`. The variables `x` and `y` have specific values: `x` is 4 and `y` is 1. 

The new values of `nx` and `ny` will be:
- `nx = x + dx` => `nx = 4 + dx`
- `ny = y + dy` => `ny = 1 + dy`

Since the exact values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `nx` and `ny`, but we can express them in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` are valid, `queue` contains applicable tuples including `(cur, i)` and `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
