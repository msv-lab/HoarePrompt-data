The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Since `y` is initially 2, the value of `ny` will depend on the value of `dy`. The variable `nx` will be the result of adding `dx` to `x`. The output state will reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the last valid `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` pairs added during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`.**
