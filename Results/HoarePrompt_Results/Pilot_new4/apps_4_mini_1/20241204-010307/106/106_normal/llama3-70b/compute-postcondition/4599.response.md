According to the code, the `for` loop iterates through a list of tuples representing the changes in `(dx, dy)`. Each iteration will assign new values to `dx` and `dy` from this list. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- The value of `y` is 1.
- The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x` and `dy`.
- The loop will execute one more time for the next tuple in the list.

Since there are four tuples in the list, after the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` would have taken the last tuple's values, which is `(1, 1)`. For the next iteration (the fifth iteration), it would start over from the first tuple `(-1, -1)` again. 

However, the important part here is that there are no changes to the other variables since they depend on the outer conditions. The loop will continue regardless because it cycles through the list of tuples.

Thus, `dx` will update to `-1` and `dy` will update to `-1` for the next iteration. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + -1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + -1`; `piece` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1**
