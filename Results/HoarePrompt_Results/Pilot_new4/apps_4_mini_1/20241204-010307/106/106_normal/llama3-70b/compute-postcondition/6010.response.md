The variables affected by the code are `nx` and `ny`, which are assigned the values based on the previous values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The value of `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, while `y` is 9. Assuming `x` has some value (not specified), `nx` will be `x - 1`, and `ny` will remain `9`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0 (for the first iteration)**.
