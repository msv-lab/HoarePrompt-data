The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the variables are not affected, and this operation does not change their values. The state of the `queue` is updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` now contains the element `(ncur, 0)`**.
