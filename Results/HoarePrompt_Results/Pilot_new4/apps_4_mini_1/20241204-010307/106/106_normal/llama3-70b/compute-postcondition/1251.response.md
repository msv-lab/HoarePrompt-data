In the given code snippet, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `nx = 1 + dx` and `ny = 2 + dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, which means we cannot determine the exact values for `nx` and `ny`. 

The variable `cur` remains unchanged, and `N` is constrained between 3 and 10. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `ncur` is assigned a value based on the indices `nx` and `ny`, which depend on `dx` and `dy`, and the other variables will remain as they are.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `cur` remains unchanged, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
