The `queue.append((ncur, 2))` operation adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` will be contained in the queue structure, but no other variables are changed or affected by this operation. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, so the output state reflects the addition to the queue along with the existing conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
