The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `parent` is a 2D array, and the specific index being updated is `[2][ncur]`. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `dist[2][ncur]`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`) remain unchanged. The values of `cur` and `piece` are now associated with the index `ncur` in the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
