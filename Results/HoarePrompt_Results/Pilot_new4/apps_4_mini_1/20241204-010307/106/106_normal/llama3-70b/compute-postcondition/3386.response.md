According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the tuples `(dx, dy)` in the list of directional moves for the knight. Since the loop iterates over these moves, it is essential that the loop can execute without any issues. 

The provided state before the loop starts indicates that `N` is an integer within the specified range and that the necessary variables (`piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) are already set up. The loop will execute successfully since the list of direction tuples is predefined and contains valid moves.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- No changes are required to `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`, as they are already in the required state for the loop to run.
- The loop variables `(dx, dy)` will iterate through the predefined directional moves without any need for additional checks.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions, `parent[1][ncur]` contains associated parent positions, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` retains updated parent positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and newly appended tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid knight move.**
