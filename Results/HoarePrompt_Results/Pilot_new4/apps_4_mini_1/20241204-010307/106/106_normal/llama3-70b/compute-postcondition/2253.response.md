The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are already part of the precondition, with `piece` being 2. Other variables' states are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur`, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
