The code snippet assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the deltas `dx` and `dy`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated as follows:

- `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`.
- `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`.

The initial conditions indicate that `y` is an integer less than `N`, but there is no specific information about `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. Therefore, the states of the other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains minimum distances from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates parents for each `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
