According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent possible movements (dx, dy). There are 8 tuples in the list, meaning the loop can execute 8 times. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1, which indicates that the loop has just processed the first tuple in the list. 

To execute one more time, the loop will move to the next tuple in the list. The current values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the next tuple in the list. The next tuple in the sequence is (-2, 1).

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, and `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`**
