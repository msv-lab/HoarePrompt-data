The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to an out-of-range index `ny`, but it is being used in the tuple. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ncur` is still invalid, but an entry has been added to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -1, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to out-of-range index `ny`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is still greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
