In the provided code snippet, the statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[0][ncur]`. The impact of the code on the program is limited to the assignment of these values.

We need to check whether any of the other variables are affected by this operation. Since the code does not modify `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, or any other variables directly, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged variables along with the assignment made to `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
