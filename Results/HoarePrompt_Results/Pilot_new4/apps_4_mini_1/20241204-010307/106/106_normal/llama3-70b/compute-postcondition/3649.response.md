Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `queue` must contain valid tuples `(ncur, 1)` corresponding to valid moves. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that both `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, and `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`.***
