The code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` while also indicating that the variable `piece` is being used. The value of `ncur` is determined by the array `A` based on the previously mentioned states. The other variables remain unaffected. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, we can note the assignment that takes place.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `piece` is used.**
