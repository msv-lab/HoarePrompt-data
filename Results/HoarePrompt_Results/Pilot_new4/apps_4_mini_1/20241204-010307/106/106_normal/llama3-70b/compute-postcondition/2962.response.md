`ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which means `ncur` reflects the value in the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined based on the movement tuples, but their specific values are not provided. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` still contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
