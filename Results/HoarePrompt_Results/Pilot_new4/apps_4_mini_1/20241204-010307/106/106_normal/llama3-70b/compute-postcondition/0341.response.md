The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the value of `parent[2][ncur]`. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, but `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`. Additionally, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`.**
