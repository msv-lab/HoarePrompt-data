The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The initial values of `nx` and `ny` are given as 1 and 2 respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to `A[1][2]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` remain unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` and `queue` are unchanged; `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`.**
