In the given code snippet, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, but its value directly impacts the assignment to `parent[2][ncur]`. 

- The variable `ncur` holds the value `A[nx][ny]`, but the specific value of `A[nx][ny]` is not provided in the initial state; however, it determines the index in the `parent` array that is being updated.
- The `piece` variable's value remains unchanged as it is equal to 2 based on the initial state.

After executing the code, the only variable that changes is `parent[2][ncur]`, which is now equal to the tuple `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`**.
