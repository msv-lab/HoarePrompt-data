The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing the current value of `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `ncur`, only that it is equal to `A[0][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged and their conditions still apply.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `ncur` is `A[0][1]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended.**
