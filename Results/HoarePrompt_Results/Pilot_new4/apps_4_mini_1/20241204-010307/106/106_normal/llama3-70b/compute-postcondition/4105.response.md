The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving the variables `x` and `y`, and the additions of `dx` and `dy`, which are not defined in the initial state. Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, the new values for `nx` and `ny` would depend on `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, without specific values for `dx` and `dy`, we express `nx` and `ny` in terms of these undefined variables. 

Thus, we have:
- `nx` becomes `0 + dx`, which is `dx`.
- `ny` becomes `2 + dy`, which is `2 + dy`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`**
