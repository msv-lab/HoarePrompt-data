Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is updated based on the reachable cells from (x, y); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1. The current value of `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
