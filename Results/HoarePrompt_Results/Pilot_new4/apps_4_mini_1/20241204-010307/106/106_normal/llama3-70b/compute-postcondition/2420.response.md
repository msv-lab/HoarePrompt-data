The values of `nx` and `ny` are affected by the code. The value of `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and since `dx` is -1, `nx` becomes `x - 1`. The value of `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, and since `y` is 0 and `dy` is 1, `ny` becomes `0 + 1`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1.**
