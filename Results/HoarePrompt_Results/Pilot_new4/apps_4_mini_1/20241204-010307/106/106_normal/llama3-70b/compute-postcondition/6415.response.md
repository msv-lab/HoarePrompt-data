The code updates `dist[0][ncur]` to be the sum of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]`, but we do not have specific values for `dist[0][cur]` or `A[-1][-1]`. 

Assuming:
- `dist[0][cur]` has some value `V`, then `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `V + 1`. 
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the changes made.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
