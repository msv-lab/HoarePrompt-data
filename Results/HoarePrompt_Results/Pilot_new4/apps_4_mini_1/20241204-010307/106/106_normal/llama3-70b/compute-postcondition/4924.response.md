Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10 and `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`, with `ncur` equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
