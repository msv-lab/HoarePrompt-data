Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the last element of the tuple, `dy` is the last second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to the value of `A[nx][ny]` for each valid `(nx, ny)`, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances from the start position to each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` contains the parent relationships for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 0)` tuples. If `N` is less than 9, the loop will not execute and `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` will remain unchanged.**
