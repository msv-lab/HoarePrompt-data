In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The specific values for `dx` and `dy` are -2 and 1, respectively. Given that `y` is equal to `N`, we can express `ny` in terms of `N`.

1. `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which means `nx` will be equal to `x - 2`.
2. `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which means `ny` will be equal to `N + 1`.

The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, which means `y` also takes on a value in that range. Therefore, `ny` will range from 4 to 11, depending on the value of `N`.

Since `nx` remains as `x - 2`, and `ny` is `N + 1`, the other variables (`N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is equal to `N + 1.**
