The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of the variables is:

- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1
- `ny` is either 0, 1, or 2
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is 2
- `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`
- `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned `(cur, piece)`

Since `queue` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it exists and is modifiable. After executing the code, the `queue` will contain the appended tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 0, 1, or 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned `(cur, piece); `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
