The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. Since the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged, the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, we can express the new values of `nx` and `ny` in terms of the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples; values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
