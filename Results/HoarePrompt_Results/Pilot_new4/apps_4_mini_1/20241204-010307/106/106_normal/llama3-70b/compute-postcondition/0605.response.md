Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` has a tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended. Otherwise, no changes are made to these variables. If the condition is not met, no changes occur in the variables involved.***
