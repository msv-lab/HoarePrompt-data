Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. If the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the conditions are not satisfied, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
