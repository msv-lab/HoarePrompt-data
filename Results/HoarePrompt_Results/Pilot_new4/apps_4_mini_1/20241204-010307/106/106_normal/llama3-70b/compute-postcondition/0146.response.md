The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. The exact values of `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` are unknown, but we know that `dist[1][ncur]` now equals `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `0 â‰¤ nx, ny < N`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
