In the provided code snippet, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The variable `cur` has a specific value, which is unchanged, while `ncur` represents a position accessible in the context. This assignment updates the `parent` array for the position `ncur` under the piece identified as `2`, establishing a relationship to the current position `cur`.

Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the previous states of all variables except for the updated `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is A[x + 1][y], `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1, parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece.`**
