Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, possibly `(ncur, 1)`, along with a new entry `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is set to 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; and `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`. If the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, no changes occur.***
