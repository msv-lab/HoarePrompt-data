The values of `nx` and `ny` are computed based on the provided values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The specific computed values for `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values assigned to `dx` and `dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are tuples containing multiple values, the code will result in multiple calculations for `nx` and `ny` in a sequential manner, assuming each tuple value is used in turn.

Given:
- `x = 0`
- `y = 1`
- `dx` is `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`
- `dy` is `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`

For each combination of `dx` and `dy`, the following calculations occur:
1. For `dx = -1`, `dy = -1`: 
   - `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`, `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`
2. For `dx = -1`, `dy = 1`: 
   - `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`, `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`
3. For `dx = 1`, `dy = -1`: 
   - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`, `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`
4. For `dx = 1`, `dy = 1`: 
   - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`, `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

Thus, the values of `nx` and `ny` will have multiple outputs based on the combinations:

- `nx` can be `-1` or `1`
- `ny` can be `0` or `2`

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State becomes:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` may contain multiple elements as a result of appending `(ncur, 0)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` can be -1 or 1, `ny` can be 0 or 2, `ncur` is the last computed value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations, `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`**.
