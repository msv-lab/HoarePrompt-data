The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the directional changes `dx` and `dy`. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but they will determine the new coordinates for `nx` and `ny`.

Since we know `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`:

- `nx` will be `2 + dx`
- `ny` will be `0 + dy`

The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `queue` now contains both `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`**.
