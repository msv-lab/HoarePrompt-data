The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Since the specific values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. Consequently, the output state reflects the fact that `nx` and `ny` have been updated based on their new calculations while keeping the original conditions intact.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` remains unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged.**
