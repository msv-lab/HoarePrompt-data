The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, which means that the `parent` array is updated at the index `[0][ncur]` with the value of `cur`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 9; `y` is 9; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 7; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][7]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9; `y` is 9; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 7; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][7]; dist[0][ncur] is equal to dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur] is equal to cur.**
