Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x][2]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` has the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to it. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
