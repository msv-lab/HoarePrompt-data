The `queue` variable is modified by appending a new tuple `(ncur, 2)` to it. The other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value (cur, piece), and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value (cur, piece), and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 2)`.**
