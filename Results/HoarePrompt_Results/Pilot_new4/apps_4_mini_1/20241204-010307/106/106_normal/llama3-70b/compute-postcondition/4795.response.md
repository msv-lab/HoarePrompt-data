The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this indicates that the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` was already greater than the value being assigned. Consequently, the value of `dist[2][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` has been updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`, `nx` is 0 + `dx`, `ny` is 0 + `dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`.**
