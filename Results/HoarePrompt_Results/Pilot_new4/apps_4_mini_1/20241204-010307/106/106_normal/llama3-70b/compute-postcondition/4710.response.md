Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][2]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated, `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `dx` is 1`, `dy` is 0. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`.***
