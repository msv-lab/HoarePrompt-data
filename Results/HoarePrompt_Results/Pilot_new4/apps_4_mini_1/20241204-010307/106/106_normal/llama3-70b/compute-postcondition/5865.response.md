The value of `cur` and `i` is not specified, but the code appends the tuple `(cur, i)` to the existing list `queue`. The variable `piece` is not directly modified by this operation, and the preconditions regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the new tuple to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` and `y` can be any values; `piece` is 2 if conditions were met at least once, else it remains 0; `dist[2][ncur]` contains the final distances from `cur` for all valid `ncur`; `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last position and state of `piece` for each valid `ncur`; `queue` now contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` where conditions were met, along with any initial tuples of the form `(ncur, 1)` and the new tuple `(cur, i)` has been added to `queue`; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
