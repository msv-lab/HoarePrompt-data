The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, which consists of the current position `cur` and the value of `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state includes all the relevant information from the initial state while updating only the affected variable.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions to allow the loop to execute, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
