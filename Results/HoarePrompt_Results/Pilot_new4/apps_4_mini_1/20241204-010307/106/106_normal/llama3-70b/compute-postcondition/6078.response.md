After the execution of the code `queue.append((ncur, 1))`, the variable `queue` is updated to include a new tuple containing `ncur` and the value `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The previous values and conditions that remain valid are:
- `N` is between 3 and 10, 
- `y` is 0, 
- `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, 
- `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, 
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, 
- `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, 
- `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, 
- `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, and must not be empty; 
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, 
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, 
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, 
- `piece` is equal to 1 while `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, 
- `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, 
- `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated and now includes `(ncur, 1)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1 while `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
