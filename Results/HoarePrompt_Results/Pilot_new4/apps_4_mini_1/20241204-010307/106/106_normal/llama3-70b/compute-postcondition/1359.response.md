The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]` based on the current values of `nx` and `ny`. The value of `nx` is equal to `2 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `N`, `x`, and `y`, and specifies the expressions for `nx` and `ny`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
