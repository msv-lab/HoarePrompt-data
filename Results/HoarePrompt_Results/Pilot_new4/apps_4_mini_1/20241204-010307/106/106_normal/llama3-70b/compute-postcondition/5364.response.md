The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Here, `nx` is evaluated as `4 + dx` and `ny` is evaluated as `1 + dy`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, respectively. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unaffected by this assignment, except for `ncur`, which now holds the value from the two-dimensional array `A` indexed by `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`.**
