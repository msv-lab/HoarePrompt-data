The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` have been defined as `1 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively, and they satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, both `nx` and `ny` will be legitimate indices for accessing elements in the array `A`.

The state of other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the output state will continue to reflect `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny`, while including the newly assigned variable `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
