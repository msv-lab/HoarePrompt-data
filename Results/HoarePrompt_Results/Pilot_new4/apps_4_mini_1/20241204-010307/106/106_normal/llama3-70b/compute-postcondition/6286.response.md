Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include `ncur, 2`. Otherwise, `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[2][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
