The value of `ncur` is now assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, indicating that `ncur` will reflect the specific value stored at the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables, including `dist`, `parent[1][ncur]`, `queue`, `nx`, and `ny`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each updated index during the loop, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
