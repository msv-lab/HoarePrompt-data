Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged except for `dist[1][ncur]` which is updated, `parent[1]` remains unchanged except for `parent[1][ncur]` which is now equal to `cur`, and `piece` is equal to 1. The `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, while `parent[0][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves. The `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` appended for each valid move resulting in an update to `dist[0][ncur]`, and now also includes the additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, with `dx` being -1, `dy` being -1 for the first iteration, `nx` being -1, `ny` being 1, and `ncur` equal to `A[-1][1]` if the condition `piece == 1 and dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` holds true.***
