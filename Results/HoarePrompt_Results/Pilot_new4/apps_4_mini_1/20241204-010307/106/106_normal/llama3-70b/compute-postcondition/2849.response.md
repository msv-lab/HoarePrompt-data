The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are not altered by this operation; rather, `queue` is updated to include the new element. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
