Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is `x - 1`, `x + 1`, or `x`, `ny` is `1`, `2`, or `3`. If both `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, there are no changes made to `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[2][ncur]`, or `queue`.***
