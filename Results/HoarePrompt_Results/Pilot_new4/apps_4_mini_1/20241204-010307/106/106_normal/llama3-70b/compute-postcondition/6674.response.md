In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, respectively, incremented by `dx` and `dy`. 

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -1 
- `y` is 2

The new values will be calculated as follows:
- `nx = x + dx = -1 + dx`
- `ny = y + dy = 2 + dy`

Since `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify the exact numeric values of `nx` and `ny`, but we can express them in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

The output state will maintain all the initial conditions while updating the values of `nx` and `ny`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `-1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if `nx` and `ny` are both in the range [0, N); `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` must be updated if conditions are met; `parent[0][ncur]` must be set accordingly; `queue` may include a new tuple if conditions are met.**
