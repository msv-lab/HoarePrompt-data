Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent` reflects the predecessor for the updated position, `queue` contains at least one tuple for the processed position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
