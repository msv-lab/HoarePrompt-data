The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` have already been processed, but their specific values are not provided. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2, `dx`, `dy` are processed, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
