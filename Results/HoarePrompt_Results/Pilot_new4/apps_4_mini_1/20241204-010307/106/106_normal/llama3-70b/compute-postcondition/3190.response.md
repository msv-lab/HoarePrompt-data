The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are still within the range `[0, N-1]`, meaning they are valid indices for the matrix `A`. Therefore, `ncur` will have a specific value that corresponds to the elements found at `A[nx][ny]`. The other variables retain their previous values, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is within the range `[0, N-1]`, `ny` is within the range `[0, N-1]`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from `(x, y)`, `parent[0][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions.**
