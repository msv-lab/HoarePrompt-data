Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not met, no actions are taken.***
