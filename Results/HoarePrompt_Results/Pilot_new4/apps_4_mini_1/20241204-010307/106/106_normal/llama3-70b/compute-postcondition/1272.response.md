The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are unchanged from their previous state. The value of `ncur` is given as `A[0][3]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is now set to `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`**.
