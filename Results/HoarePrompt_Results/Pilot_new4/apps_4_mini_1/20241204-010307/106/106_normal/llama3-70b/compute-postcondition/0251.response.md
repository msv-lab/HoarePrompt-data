The assignment `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value at index `[2][ncur]` of the `dist` array. The previous state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, but we do not have the specific values of `cur` or `dist[2][cur]`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dist[2][ncur]`, but we can state that it has increased by 1 from its previous value.

The other variables remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; iteration count is 4; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]; dist[2][ncur] is updated to dist[2][cur] + 1**.
