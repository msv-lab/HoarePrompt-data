The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The initial state already includes the values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and other variables that are not directly modified by this code snippet. The `queue` variable will now include an additional tuple consisting of `ncur` and the value `2`. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the piece is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.**
