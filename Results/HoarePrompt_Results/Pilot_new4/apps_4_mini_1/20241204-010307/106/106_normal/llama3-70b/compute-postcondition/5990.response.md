Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the last element of the tuple, `dy` is the last second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned value `cur` and piece `1`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.***
