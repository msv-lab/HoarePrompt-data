To assess the impact of the provided code snippet, let us break down the conditions and variables involved:

- Initially:
  - `dx` is 1
  - `dy` is -1
  - `nx` is equal to `x + 1`
  - `ny` is equal to `y - 1`
  - We have the condition that if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`.

The code to be executed is:
```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Evaluate `nx` and `ny`:**
   - `nx = x + 1`
   - `ny = y - 1`
  
2. **Accessing `A[nx][ny]`:**
   - If the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied, then `ncur` will be assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.
   - However, the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `A` are not given, so we cannot compute the exact value of `ncur`.

3. **Output State Update:**
   - The only variable that is explicitly affected by the code is `ncur`, which is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.
   - The values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged since they are not modified by the provided code.

### Final Output State:
Since we do not have specific values for `x`, `y`, or `A`, we will represent the output state with the relation:

Output State: **`dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
