Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
