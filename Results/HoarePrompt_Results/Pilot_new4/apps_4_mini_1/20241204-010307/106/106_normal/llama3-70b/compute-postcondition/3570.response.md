Postcondition: ***`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions. If `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N) and `piece` is equal to 2 with `dist[2][ncur]` being greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to the distances or parent arrays.***
