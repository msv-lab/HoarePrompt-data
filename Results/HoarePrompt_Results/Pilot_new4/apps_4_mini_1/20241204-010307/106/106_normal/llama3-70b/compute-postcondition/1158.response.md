The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The value of `ncur` is derived from `A[-1][0]`, but since the initial value of `cur` is not provided, we cannot determine an exact value for `dist[0][ncur]`. However, we know that it's dependent on `dist[0][cur]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is A[-1][0]; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
