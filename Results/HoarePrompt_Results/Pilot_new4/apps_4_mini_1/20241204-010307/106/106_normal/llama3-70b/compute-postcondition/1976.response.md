According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction tuples `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. The loop will execute four times, once for each tuple. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration includes the conditions related to `piece`, `dist`, `ncur`, and `cur`, but we need to focus on the loop variables `dx` and `dy`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop would have completed one of the directional tuples.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we note that the loop iterates through the four pairs. If the current iteration is for the second pair, `(-1, 1)`, the next iteration will be for `(1, -1)`, and so on.

Since we are ensuring the loop executes one more time, we need to account for which direction it will be processing next. If the last executed direction was `(1, 1)`, the next will be `(-1, -1)`.

Therefore, if we are to ensure the loop executes one more time after the last iteration, we will set the state as follows:

State: **`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains unchanged, `dist` and `parent` states remain as they are, and the next direction is `(1, -1)`**.
