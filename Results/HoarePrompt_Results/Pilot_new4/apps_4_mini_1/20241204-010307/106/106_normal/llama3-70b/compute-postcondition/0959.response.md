The code snippet updates the `dist` array using the values from `dist[2][cur]` and increments it by 1 to assign it to `dist[2][ncur]`. The values of `ncur` and `cur` depend on the previous values of `nx`, `ny`, and `cur` respectively. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`.

The previous state of the variables is:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`

Now we note that:
- The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

The output state needs to reflect that `dist[2][ncur]` has been updated while preserving the other variable states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
