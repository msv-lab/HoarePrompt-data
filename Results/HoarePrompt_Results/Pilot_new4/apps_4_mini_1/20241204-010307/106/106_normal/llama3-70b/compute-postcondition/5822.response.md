To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the line `ncur = A[nx][ny]` based on the initial state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`
- `piece` is 0
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is 0
- `ny` is 1

The line of code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value from a 2D array (or list) `A` at the position specified by the indices `nx` and `ny` to the variable `ncur`. Given the initial values, `nx` is 0 and `ny` is 1. 

However, the specific values of `A` are not provided, meaning we can't determine a concrete value for `ncur`. Thus, we cannot explicitly state what `ncur` is assigned. 

Therefore, the relevant part of the output state will only reflect that `ncur` has been assigned a value from `A` based on those indices.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[0][1]`.**
