Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `dist` is initialized, `parent` is initialized, `queue` can potentially be empty or initialized, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
