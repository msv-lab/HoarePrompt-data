According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the valid direction tuples `(dx, dy)` being iterated over. The loop iterates over a list containing 4 tuples representing the knight's potential moves in the given directions. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the current direction being processed.

Since there are 4 tuples in the list, if this is the last iteration, the current state must be adjusted to reflect the next iteration. If the previous iteration was processing the last tuple (0, 1), in the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will not have valid tuples left to process.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` and `dy` would need to correspond to the next tuple in the list, which is the first tuple `(-1, 0)`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
