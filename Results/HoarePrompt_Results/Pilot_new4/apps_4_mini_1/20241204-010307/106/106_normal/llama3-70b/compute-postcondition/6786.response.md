According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`, which contains 4 pairs representing the changes in `x` and `y` coordinates. The current values of `dx` and `dy` will take each of these pairs in sequence. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `y` is 2. Therefore, the current iteration may have used either the first, second, third, or fourth pair of `(dx, dy)` to compute `nx` and `ny`.

1. If the last pair used was `(-1, -1)`, the next pair will be `(-1, 1)`. 
2. If the last pair used was `(-1, 1)`, the next pair will be `(1, -1)`.
3. If the last pair used was `(1, -1)`, the next pair will be `(1, 1)`.
4. If the last pair used was `(1, 1)`, this will complete the loop.

Since the loop is set to run for each pair and we have completed one iteration, there are still 3 pairs left.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and `piece` is the same**.
