The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `nx` and `ny` have changed based on `dx` and `dy`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`**
