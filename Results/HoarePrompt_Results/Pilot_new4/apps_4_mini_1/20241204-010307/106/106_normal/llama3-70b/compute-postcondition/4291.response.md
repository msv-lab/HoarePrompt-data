Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged, and `queue` now contains all previous tuples plus the tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is 2 and not equal to `i`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, the states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
