Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains the original elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)` if `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. In this case, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`. If `piece` does not equal 0 or the condition is not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
