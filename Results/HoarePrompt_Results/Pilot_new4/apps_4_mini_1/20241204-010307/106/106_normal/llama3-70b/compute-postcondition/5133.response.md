The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` has the value `A[4][2]` from the initial state, and `1` is a static value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 4, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is A[4][2], `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][A[4][2]]` is (cur, 1), and `queue` now includes (A[4][2], 1)**.
