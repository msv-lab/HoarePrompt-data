The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`, and since `nx` can be either -1 or 1 and `ny` can be either 1 or 3, `ncur` is defined accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged in this operation.

Since the specific value of `cur` is not provided, but it is assumed to be defined prior to this code snippet, we denote it as `cur` for clarity.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is either -1 or 1, `ny` is either 1 or 3, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and is not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
