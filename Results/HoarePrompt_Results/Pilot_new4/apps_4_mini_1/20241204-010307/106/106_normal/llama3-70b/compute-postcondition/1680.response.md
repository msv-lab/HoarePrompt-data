To analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration and the for loop statement, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop.

1. The loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy) in [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]`. There are 8 tuples in this list, meaning that the loop will run a total of 8 times.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `y` is 1. The values of `dx` and `dy` will change with each iteration through the tuples in the loop, affecting the values of `nx` and `ny`.

3. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are determined as follows:
   - `nx` is calculated as `x - 2`, which means it will be influenced by the current `dx` value.
   - `ny` is calculated based on `dy`, which is added to `y`. 

4. The conditions for executing the loop depend on the values of `nx` and `ny`. Specifically, the conditions are `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. 

5. Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, we must ensure that after the loop executes for the next iteration, the values of `nx` and `ny` must still satisfy these conditions.

Considering these points, we will infer the new values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` at the start of the next iteration. The first iteration of the loop will likely start with `dx = -2` and `dy = -1`, and thus:

- `nx` will be calculated as `x - 2`.
- `ny` will be calculated as `y + dy`, which for the first tuple will be `1 - 1 = 0`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that:
- If `dx` is `-2` and `dy` is `-1`, then `nx = x - 2` and `ny = 0` must satisfy the conditions which were already stated.

After evaluating these conditions, we can conclude that:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` will depend on the updated values of `nx` and `ny` as per the loop execution.**
