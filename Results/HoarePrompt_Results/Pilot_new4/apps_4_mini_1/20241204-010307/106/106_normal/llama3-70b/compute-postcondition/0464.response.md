The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `nx` is equal to `x + 2`
- `ny` is equal to `3`
- `dx` is 2
- `dy` is 1

The calculations are as follows:
- `nx` becomes `x + 2` (from `nx` being originally `x + 2`, it is updated to `x + dx` which is `x + 2`)
- `ny` becomes `y + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`

Since the value of `nx` does not change (it remains `x + 2`), we focus on updating `ny`.

Thus, the Output State is: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to 3, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, and now `ny` is updated to 3.** 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to 3, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1.**
