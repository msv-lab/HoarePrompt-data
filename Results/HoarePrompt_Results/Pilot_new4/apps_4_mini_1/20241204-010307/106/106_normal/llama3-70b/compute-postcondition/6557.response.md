Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is unchanged, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` which is appended to it.**
