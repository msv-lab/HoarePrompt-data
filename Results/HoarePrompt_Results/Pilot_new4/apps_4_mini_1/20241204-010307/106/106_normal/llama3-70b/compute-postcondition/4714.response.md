The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x` and `ny` is equal to 1. Therefore, `ncur` becomes equal to `A[x][1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x][1]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated; `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1**
