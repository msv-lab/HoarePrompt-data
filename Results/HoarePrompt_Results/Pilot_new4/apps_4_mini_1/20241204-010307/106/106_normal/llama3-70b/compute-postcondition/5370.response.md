Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; if `piece` is equal to 0, then `dist[0][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid moves for all applicable `(dx, dy)` tuples, `parent[0][ncur]` contains path information for those moves, and `queue` contains tuples representing the current position and piece (specifically `(cur, 0)` for each valid move performed). If no valid moves were available, `dist[0][ncur]`, `parent[0][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
