The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The previous state of `queue` is not directly mentioned, but we can infer that it contains at least one existing element, as it is referenced before this line.

The variable `ncur` retains its previous value as `A[nx][ny]`, and the value `0` is added to `queue` as a second element in the tuple. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
