The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the tuple `(cur, piece)`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), `piece` equals 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`**.
