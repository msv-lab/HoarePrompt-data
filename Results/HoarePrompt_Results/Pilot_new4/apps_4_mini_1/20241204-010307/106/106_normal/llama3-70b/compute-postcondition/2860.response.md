Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `dist[1]` holds the shortest distances for the positions reachable with `piece` value `1`, `parent[1]` indicates the predecessors for those positions, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 1)` for all reachable positions `ncur` where `dist[1][ncur]` was updated. If the conditions for executing the loop are not satisfied (i.e., if `piece` is not `1` or if no updates were made), then `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
