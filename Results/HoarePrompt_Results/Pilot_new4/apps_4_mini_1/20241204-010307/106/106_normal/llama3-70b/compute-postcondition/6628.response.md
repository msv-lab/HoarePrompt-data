The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`. The new value is determined by the expression `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variables affected here are `dist`, `ncur`, and `cur`. 

We know that `dist` is initialized for all valid positions, `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and we have a distance condition provided in the initial state. However, we do not have specific values for `dist`, `cur`, or `ncur` but understand they are valid in their context.

Thus, after executing the code, the state is updated to reflect that `dist[2][ncur]` now has a value one greater than `dist[2][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `dist` is updated such that `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent` is initialized for all valid positions; `queue` is initialized to contain reachable positions from (1, 0); `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; and the distance condition holds as previously stated.**
