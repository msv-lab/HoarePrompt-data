Postcondition: ***`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy` for each pair (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1); if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
