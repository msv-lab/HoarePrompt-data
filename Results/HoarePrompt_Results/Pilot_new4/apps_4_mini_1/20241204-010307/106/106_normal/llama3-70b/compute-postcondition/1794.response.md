Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code:
- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, where `dx` is -1. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `x - 1`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, where `dy` is 1. Therefore, `ny` will be equal to `y + 1`, which equals `2 + 1 = 3`.

The values of `N` and `piece` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code. The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state; hence its value remains unspecified.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 3**
