The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, the new values will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. The ranges for `nx` and `ny` have also been defined as [0, N-1], meaning they must remain within this range based on the value of `N`.

Since the exact values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, the new values for `nx` and `ny` are expressed as follows:
- `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`

The output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while retaining all other present variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions for reachable states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from the valid moves, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `nx` is in the range [0, N-1], `ny` is in the range [0, N-1].**
