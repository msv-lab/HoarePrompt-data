Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains the elements prior to the append operation plus `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N` are satisfied, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is (cur, piece), and `queue` has been updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
