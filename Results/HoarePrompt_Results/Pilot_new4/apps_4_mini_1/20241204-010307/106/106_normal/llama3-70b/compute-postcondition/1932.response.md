The code snippet updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with their respective changes `dx` and `dy`. However, since the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot assign specific values to `nx` and `ny`. 

The following variables remain unchanged: `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `piece`. The value of `y` is unchanged at 4, and the loop is set to execute 8 times, but this does not directly affect the values of the updated variables in this context.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x` and `y` with their respective deltas. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` remains unchanged, `piece` is unchanged, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
