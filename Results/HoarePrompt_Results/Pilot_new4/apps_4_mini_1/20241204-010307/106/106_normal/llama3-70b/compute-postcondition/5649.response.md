Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` may contain multiple elements as a result of appending `(ncur, 0)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, now including `(ncur, 1)`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[1][2]`; `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`; since `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `dx` and `dy` have been assigned `(1, 1)` in the last iteration; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
