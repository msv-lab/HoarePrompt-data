The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the original values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. Given that `x` is 1 and `dx` is -1, `nx` will be `1 + (-1)`, which equals `0`. For `ny`, since `y` is 2 and `dy` is 1, `ny` will be `2 + 1`, which equals `3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**.
