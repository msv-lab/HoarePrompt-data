Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `parent[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `queue` is updated during the loop execution, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` is less than `N`.***
