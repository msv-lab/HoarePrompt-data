Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances, where `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents with `parent[0][ncur]` equal to `cur`; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains (cur, i) and (ncur, 0); `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy` where `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1.**
