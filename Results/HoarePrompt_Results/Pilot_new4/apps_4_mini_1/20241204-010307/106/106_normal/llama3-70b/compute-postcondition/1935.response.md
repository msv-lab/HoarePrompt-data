Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` remains unchanged, `piece` is unchanged, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
