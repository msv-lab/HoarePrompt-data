The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the `queue`, but no other variables are changed by this operation.

The previous state of the variables remains valid, so the output state includes all the initial information as well as the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
