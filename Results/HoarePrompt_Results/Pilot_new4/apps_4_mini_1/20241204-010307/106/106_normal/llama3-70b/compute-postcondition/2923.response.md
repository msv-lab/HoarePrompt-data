According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the valid positions `(nx, ny)` that can be reached based on the changes in `dx` and `dy`. The states that need to be considered for the loop to execute include the conditions regarding the `dist` array and the position updates. For the loop to execute successfully, there should be at least one valid position that can be reached where the conditions are met (i.e., `piece == 0` and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`). 

Since `y` is initialized to 0 and `N` is between 3 and 10, we need to ensure that the loop can indeed process valid positions based on these conditions. Specifically, we need to indicate that at least one position should be reachable and have its distance updated.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` must indicate at least one reachable position with the updated distance, `parent` must reflect the predecessor for the updated position, `queue` must contain at least one tuple for the processed position**.
