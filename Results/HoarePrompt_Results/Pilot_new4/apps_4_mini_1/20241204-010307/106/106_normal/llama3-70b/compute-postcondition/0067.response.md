The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`, where `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `y`, `dx`, or `dy`, but it suggests that they exist and are involved in the calculation. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all reachable `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values, `queue` contains all reachable `ncur` values along with the value 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
