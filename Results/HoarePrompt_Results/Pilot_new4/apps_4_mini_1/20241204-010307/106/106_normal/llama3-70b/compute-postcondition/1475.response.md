The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` remain unchanged, and the other variables retain their previous states. The state of the queue is updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][2]; dist[2][ncur] is updated to dist[2][cur] + 1; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, piece; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
