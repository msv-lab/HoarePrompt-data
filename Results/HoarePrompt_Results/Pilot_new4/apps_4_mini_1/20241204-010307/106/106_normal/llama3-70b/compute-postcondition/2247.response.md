The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current position `(x, y)` incremented by the respective values from the tuples in `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` represent directional changes. However, the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output will simply convey that `nx` and `ny` are dependent on `x` and `y`, with the changes reflecting the directional moves.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur` for all reachable indices, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all updated elements based on valid moves, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`**.
