The assignment `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value from the 2D array `A` at the coordinates given by `nx` and `ny` to the variable `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `-2` and `1`, respectively, so the value assigned to `ncur` will depend on the content of array `A` at that specific index. However, without knowing the specific values or structure of `A`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`. 

The other variables in the initial state (`N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `cur`) remain unchanged by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]**.
