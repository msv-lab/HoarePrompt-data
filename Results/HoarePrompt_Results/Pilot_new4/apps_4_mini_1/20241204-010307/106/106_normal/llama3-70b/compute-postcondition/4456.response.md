The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are now included in the `queue`, which previously contained valid positions including `(ncur, 2)`. Therefore, the updated queue will now contain two entries of `(ncur, 2)`.

The states of other variables remain unchanged, and we ensure that the relevant information from the initial state is represented in the output.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` now contains valid positions including two instances of (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][N + 1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
