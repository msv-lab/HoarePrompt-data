Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` and `ny` are updated based on each tuple `(dx, dy)` from the list, iterating through all combinations. If both `nx` and `ny` remain within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`, then `ncur` takes the value of `A[nx][ny]` for each valid position, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated accordingly. The `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned to `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur`, and each time a new position is added to `queue`, it contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions are not met for any iteration, no changes occur for that specific iteration. At the end of the loop, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` may contain multiple updates depending on how many valid moves were found.**
