Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[4 + dx][dy]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the program does not change any values.***
