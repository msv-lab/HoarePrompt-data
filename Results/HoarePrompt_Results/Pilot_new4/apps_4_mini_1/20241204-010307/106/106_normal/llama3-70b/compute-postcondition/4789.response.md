Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` has been updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for all reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`. The values of `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` reflect the shortest distance and parent tuple for each position that was reachable based on the conditions provided in the loop. If no positions were reachable, then `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.`**
