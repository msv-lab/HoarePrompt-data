Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
