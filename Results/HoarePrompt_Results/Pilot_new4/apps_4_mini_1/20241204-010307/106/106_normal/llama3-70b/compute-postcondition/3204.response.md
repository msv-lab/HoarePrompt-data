Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is updated to 1 and `ny` to -1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. If the conditions are not met, no changes occur. Otherwise, no actions take place since there is no else part.***
