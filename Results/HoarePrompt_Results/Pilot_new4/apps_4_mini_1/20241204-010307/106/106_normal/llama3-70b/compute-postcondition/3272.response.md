Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position `(x, y)` to all reachable positions in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent positions of each reachable position in the grid, and `queue` contains the tuples of positions that can be explored further if they were valid. The loop will have executed 8 times, corresponding to all the specified deltas for the knight's moves, and may have updated the states of `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` only if the conditions were met based on the values in `A`, `dist`, and `piece`. If the conditions were never met, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
