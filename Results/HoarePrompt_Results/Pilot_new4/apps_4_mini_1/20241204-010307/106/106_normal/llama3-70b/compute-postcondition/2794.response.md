In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The operation performed is as follows:

- `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`.
- `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`.

Given that `dx` is `0` and `dy` is `1`, the calculations for `nx` and `ny` will be:
- `nx = x + 0`, which simplifies to `nx = x`.
- `ny = y + 1`, which means `ny` will be the current `y` coordinate incremented by `1`.

Since `N`, `y`, `piece`, and other variables remain unchanged, aside from `nx` and `ny`, we can summarize the updated values.

The output state retains all conditions of the valid preconditions while updating the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
