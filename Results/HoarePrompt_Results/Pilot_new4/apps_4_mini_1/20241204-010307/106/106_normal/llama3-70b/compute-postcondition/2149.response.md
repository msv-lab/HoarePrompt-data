Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur]` plus 1, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
