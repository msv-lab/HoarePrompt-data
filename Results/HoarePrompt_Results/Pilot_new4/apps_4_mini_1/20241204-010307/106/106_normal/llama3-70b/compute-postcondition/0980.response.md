According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing `(dx, dy)` values. The loop will execute once for each tuple in this list. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` correspond to one of the tuples from the list. 

The previous state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10. Since the loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples, the loop will execute a total of 8 times (one for each tuple). If the loop is currently executing with `dx` and `dy` being the values from the last iteration, then `dx` and `dy` need to be incremented to the next tuple in the list for the loop to execute again.

To determine the next `dx` and `dy` values, we note that the last pair would be `(-1, 2)`. Thus, the next pair will be `(1, -2)`. The loop can execute again since it will continue cycling through the predefined list of tuples.

The state does not involve any additional changes except for updating `dx` and `dy` to the next tuple in the list. There are no dependencies on `ncur`, `piece`, or the queue that would prevent the loop from executing again.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` remains 0, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`.**
