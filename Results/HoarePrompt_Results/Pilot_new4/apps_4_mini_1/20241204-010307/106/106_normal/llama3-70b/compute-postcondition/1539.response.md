To analyze the impact of the code `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, we note that `nx` is 1 and `ny` is 3. This means that `ncur` is assigned the value from the 1st index and 3rd index of the 2D array `A`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `cur`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, `queue`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged, but the value of `ncur` will now reflect the specific element of the array `A`.

Since `A[x][y]` is defined and now we are accessing `A[nx][ny]`, we update `ncur` accordingly. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is `A[1][3]`.**
