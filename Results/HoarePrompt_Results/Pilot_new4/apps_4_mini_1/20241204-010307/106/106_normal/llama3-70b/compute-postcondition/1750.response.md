Output State: **`dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated distances for valid `ncur` indices if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid `(cur, piece)` pair for those `ncur`, and `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 2)` appended during the iterations. If the loop did not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
