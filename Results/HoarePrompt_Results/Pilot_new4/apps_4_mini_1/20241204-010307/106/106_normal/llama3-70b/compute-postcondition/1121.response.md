Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, if `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent` is updated at index `[2][ncur]` to the tuple `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.***
