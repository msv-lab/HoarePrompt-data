The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged, while `dx` and `dy` are updated in each iteration based on the valid tuples from the `queue`. The output state retains the conditions of `N`, `queue`, `dist`, `parent`, and the unchanged `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` corresponds to the respective `cur` and `piece`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
