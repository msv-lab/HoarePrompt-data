The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` are not altered by this operation. However, the `queue` variable now contains an additional element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur, piece`, `queue` now includes an additional element (ncur, 0)**
