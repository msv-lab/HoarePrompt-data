The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of the program continues to hold the preconditions provided.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N - 1` (inclusive), `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
