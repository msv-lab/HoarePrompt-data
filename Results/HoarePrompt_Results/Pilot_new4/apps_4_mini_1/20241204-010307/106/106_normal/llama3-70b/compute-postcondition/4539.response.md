Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position along with the additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
