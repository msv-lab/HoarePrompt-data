The code appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer `1` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `ncur`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[1][ncur]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged after the code's execution. Therefore, the output state includes all the preconditions while noting the action taken on the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple (cur, piece), and the tuple (ncur, 1) has been appended to `queue`.**
