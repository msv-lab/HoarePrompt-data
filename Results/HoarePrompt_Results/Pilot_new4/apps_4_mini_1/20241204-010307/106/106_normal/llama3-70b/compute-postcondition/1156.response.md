The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The values of `x` and `y` are both `1`. The values for `dx` and `dy` must be derived from the next tuple in the list, which is `(-2, -1)` for this execution.

Calculating `nx` and `ny`:
- `nx = x + dx = 1 + (-2) = -1`
- `ny = y + dy = 1 + (-1) = 0`

The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, so we can state them as follows:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 1

The updated values after executing the code are:
- `nx` is -1
- `ny` is 0

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0**
