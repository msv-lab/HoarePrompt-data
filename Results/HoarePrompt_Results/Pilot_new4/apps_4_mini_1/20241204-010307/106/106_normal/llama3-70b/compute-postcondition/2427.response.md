Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`. After all iterations, `dist[1][ncur]` for all valid `ncur` reached from `(x, y)` will be updated based on the minimum distance calculated from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` will reflect the previous state leading to `ncur`, and `queue` will contain tuples `(ncur, 1)` for all valid `ncur` values that were updated. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will remain unchanged from their initial states.**
