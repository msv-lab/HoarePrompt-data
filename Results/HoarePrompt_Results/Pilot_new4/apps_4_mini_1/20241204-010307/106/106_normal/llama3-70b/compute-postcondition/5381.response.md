According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. Since the loop will execute for each of these tuples, we need to consider the current values of `dx` and `dy`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 4 and `y` is 1. 

The loop will execute a total of 4 times, once for each tuple in the list. After the last iteration (when `dx` and `dy` correspond to `(1, 1)`), the next iteration would no longer have a tuple available in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the program state must reflect that it has completed all iterations of the provided tuples.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1**.
