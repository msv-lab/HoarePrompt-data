The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The values of `x` and `y` are within the range `0` and `N-1`, and `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction. Therefore, `nx` and `ny` will be calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
