The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and the value of `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which implies that `parent[2][ncur]` now holds a tuple or a list consisting of `cur` and `piece`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
