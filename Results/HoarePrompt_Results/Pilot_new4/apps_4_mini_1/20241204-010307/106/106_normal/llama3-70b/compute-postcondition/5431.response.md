The variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on these undefined variables. Therefore, we don't have specific values for `nx` and `ny` after the code execution, but we know their expressions based on `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`**
