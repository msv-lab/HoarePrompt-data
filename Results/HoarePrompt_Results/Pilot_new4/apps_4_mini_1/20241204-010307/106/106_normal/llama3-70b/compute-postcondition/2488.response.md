The code assigns the values `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The value of `dx` is -1 and the value of `dy` is -1. The new coordinates `nx` and `ny` are calculated as follows:

- `nx = x + dx`, which translates to `nx = x - 1`
- `ny = y + dy`, which translates to `ny = y - 1`, and since `y` is initially 1, this becomes `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`.

The variable `N` remains unchanged and within its range, and the values of `dx` and `dy` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0**.
