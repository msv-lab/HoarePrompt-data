The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, so their specific values remain unknown. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
