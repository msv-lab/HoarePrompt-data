According to the code, the loop iterates over the directional changes represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will execute for each of these tuples.

At the end of the last iteration, we need to analyze the current states: `N` is at least 5, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist` and `parent` have been updated for the current state. The loop variable `(dx, dy)` takes on the values from the list of direction changes in each iteration.

In the context of the loop, since it has already completed for all four tuples, the next execution of the loop will attempt to iterate over the same list again. However, since there are no changes to the state of `N`, `dist`, or `parent` that would affect the conditions for the next iteration (the loop iterates over a static list), the states will remain the same.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, the states will be unchanged, as the loop body does not modify any of these variables or conditions.

State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, and `piece` is equal to 2.**
