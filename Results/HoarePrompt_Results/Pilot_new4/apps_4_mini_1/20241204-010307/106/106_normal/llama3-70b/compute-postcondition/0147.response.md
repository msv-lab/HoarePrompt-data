The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `parent[1][ncur]` is now specifically set to the tuple `(cur, piece)`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `0 â‰¤ nx, ny < N`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`**.
