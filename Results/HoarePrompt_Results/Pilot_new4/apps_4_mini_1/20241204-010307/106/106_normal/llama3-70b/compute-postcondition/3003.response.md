The line of code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value in the `dist` array at position `[0][ncur]`. The new value is calculated by taking the value currently at `dist[0][cur]` and adding 1 to it. 

1. The variable `dist` is being modified at the index `[0][ncur]`.
2. The expression `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged in this operation, and the output value for `dist[0][ncur]` depends on the existing value at `dist[0][cur]`.

Since we do not have specific values for `dist` or `cur`, we cannot quantify the exact new values but can indicate the relationship.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
