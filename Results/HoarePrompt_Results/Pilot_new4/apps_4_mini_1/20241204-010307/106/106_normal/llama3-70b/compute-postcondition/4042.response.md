According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples that represent the changes in `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in this list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1. The loop will execute one more time for the next tuple in the list, which is (-2, 1). Thus, `dx` will be -2 and `dy` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, and `ny` is 0.**
