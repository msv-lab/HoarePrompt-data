The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the previous state, as `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `dist` contains updated distances with `dist[0][ncur]` equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent` contains respective parents; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended; the value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0; `x + dx` and `y + dy` are within valid bounds of A; `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`.**
