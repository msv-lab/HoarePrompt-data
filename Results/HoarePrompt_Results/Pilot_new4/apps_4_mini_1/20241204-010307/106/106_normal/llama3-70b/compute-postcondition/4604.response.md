The `queue` variable is modified by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of the queue will now include an additional element. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
