The code assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`, which is calculated as `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, but it implies that the value of `dist[2][cur]` exists. After this assignment, the only modified variable is `dist[2][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
