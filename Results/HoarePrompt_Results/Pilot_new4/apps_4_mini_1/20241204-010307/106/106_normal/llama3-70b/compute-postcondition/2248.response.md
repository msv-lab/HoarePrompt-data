Postcondition: ***`piece` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur` for all reachable indices, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all updated elements based on valid moves, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, meaning 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny`, and both `nx` and `ny` are less than `N`.***
