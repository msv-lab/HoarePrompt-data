The code assigns the current value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` along with the variable `piece`. Since the definition of `ncur` is based on `A[-2][2]`, it remains unchanged as `A[-2][2]`. The other variables retain their previous values, and the output state reflects the new assignment made to `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
