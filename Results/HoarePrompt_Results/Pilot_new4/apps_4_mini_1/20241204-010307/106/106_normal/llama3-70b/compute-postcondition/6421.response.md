According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible combinations of `dx` and `dy`. The execution of the loop itself does not depend on the states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. However, it's important that the loop can execute successfully and that the context is set correctly for the iterations.

Given that `dx` and `dy` are used for the valid combinations of movements, there are no specific variable states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute in terms of their values or conditions. Rather, we should ensure that the loop can utilize these tuples as intended.

Thus, the relevant states include the current values of `dx` and `dy` during the iterations. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances calculated, `parent[0]` reflects the parents of the nodes, `queue` may contain valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `dx` and `dy` will take on values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]**
