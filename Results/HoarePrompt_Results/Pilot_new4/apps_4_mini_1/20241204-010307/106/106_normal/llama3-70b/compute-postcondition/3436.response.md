The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are not changed, and the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the updated state of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `piece`, `queue` has `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
