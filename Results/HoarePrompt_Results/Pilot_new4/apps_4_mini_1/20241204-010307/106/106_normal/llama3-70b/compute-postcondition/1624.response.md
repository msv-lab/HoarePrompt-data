The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, as well as `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, `queue`, and `ncur` remain unchanged except for `dist[1][ncur]`, which is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the output state after executing the code will reflect the updated value of `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
