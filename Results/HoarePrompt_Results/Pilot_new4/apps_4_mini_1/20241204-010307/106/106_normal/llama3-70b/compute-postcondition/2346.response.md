The line of code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at index `[2][ncur]` to the value of `cur` and `piece` is also a variable that is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state but indicates its presence.

Given that `dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position and `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, this code updates `parent[2]` to reflect the current position (`cur`) and associates it with the state or piece at that position.

The key details in the output state will reflect that the `parent` array has been updated for the specific position `ncur`:

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`**.
