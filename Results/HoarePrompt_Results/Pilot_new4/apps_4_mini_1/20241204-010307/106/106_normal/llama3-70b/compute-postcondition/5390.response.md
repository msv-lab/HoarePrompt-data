The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`.

- `x` is 4, and `dx` is -1, so `nx` becomes `4 + (-1) = 3`.
- `y` is 1, and `dy` is -1, so `ny` becomes `1 + (-1) = 0`.

The values of `N`, `piece`, and the original values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the valid preconditions after executing the code include the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0**.
