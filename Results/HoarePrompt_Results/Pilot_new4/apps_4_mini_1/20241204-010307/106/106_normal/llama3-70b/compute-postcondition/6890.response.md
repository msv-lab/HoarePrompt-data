The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and `piece` is also involved in the operation but does not affect any other variables. The previous values of the variables `ncur` and `cur` are relevant here. 

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the `parent` array is updated at the index `[2][ncur]` with the value of `cur`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and the `dist` array remain unchanged. The values of `cur`, `piece`, and `ncur` are not specified but can be referenced in general terms.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is updated based on the reachable cells from (x, y); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
