According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent the values of `dx` and `dy`. In each iteration, the loop will explore a different combination of these values. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1, which means this combination has already been processed. The next combination in the list is `(-2, 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `dx` and `dy` need to be updated to this next tuple, and all other states remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`, and if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece), and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**
