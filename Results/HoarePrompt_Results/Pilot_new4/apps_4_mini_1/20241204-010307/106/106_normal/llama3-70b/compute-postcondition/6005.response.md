The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are unchanged in this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will retain all the initial conditions while noting that the tuple has been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 8, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][8]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, and a tuple `(ncur, 1)` has been appended to `queue`.**
