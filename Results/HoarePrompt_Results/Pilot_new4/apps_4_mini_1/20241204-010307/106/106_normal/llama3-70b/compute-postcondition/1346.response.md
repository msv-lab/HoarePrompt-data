Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions for reachable states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from the valid moves, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, and `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates derived from the original `x` and `y` using the specified moves. If any conditions for `nx` or `ny` are not met during the iterations, no updates occur in `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`, but those variables maintain their state from the loop execution.**
