The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, but `queue` now includes this new tuple. The other variables remain valid as per the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)`, `queue` includes the previous entries plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
