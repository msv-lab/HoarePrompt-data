According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing direction changes in `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1, which means it has just executed the condition for the tuple (-1, 1). The next tuple in the list is (1, -1).

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `dx` to 1 and `dy` to -1, which corresponds to the next tuple in the enumeration. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop itself but rather by the loop body which is omitted.

State: **`dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`.**
