The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are used directly. The state of `dist`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `parent` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
