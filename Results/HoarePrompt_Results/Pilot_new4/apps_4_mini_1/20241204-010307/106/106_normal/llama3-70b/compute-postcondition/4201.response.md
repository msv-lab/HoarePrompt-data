Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2]` remains unchanged, `parent[2]` remains unchanged, and `queue` contains the tuple `(cur, i)`. If `piece` equals `i`, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.***
