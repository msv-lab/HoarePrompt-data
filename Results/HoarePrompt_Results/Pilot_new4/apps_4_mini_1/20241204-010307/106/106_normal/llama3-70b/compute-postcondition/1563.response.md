Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not satisfied, no actions are taken.***
