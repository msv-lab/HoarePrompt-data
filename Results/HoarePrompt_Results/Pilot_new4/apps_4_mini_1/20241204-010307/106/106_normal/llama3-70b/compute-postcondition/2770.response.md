After executing the code, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `cur`, and `piece`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
