Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and the distance from the second piece at `ncur` is greater than the distance from the second piece at `cur` plus 1.***
