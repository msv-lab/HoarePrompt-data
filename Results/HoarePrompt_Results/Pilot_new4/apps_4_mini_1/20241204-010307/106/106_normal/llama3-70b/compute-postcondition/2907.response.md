The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific values for `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations with the tuples list reset to [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**.
