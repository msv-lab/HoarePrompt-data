Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, and `ny` is equal to `dy`. If `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (i.e., `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to the tuple `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` variables.***
