The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`, which is dependent on the previous state of `cur` and `piece`. The value of `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, and since `nx` and `ny` are calculated from `x` and `y`, they can be expressed as follows: `nx` is `2 + dx` and `ny` is `0 + dy`. The values of `dist[1][ncur]` have already been updated based on the previous state of `dist[1][cur]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`.**
