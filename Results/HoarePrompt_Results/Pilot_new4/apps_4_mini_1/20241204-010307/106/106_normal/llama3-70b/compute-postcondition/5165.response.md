Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` has been updated for reachable positions based on the conditions set within the loop, `parent` contains valid parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` for all valid updates. Additionally, `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no valid positions were reachable, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
