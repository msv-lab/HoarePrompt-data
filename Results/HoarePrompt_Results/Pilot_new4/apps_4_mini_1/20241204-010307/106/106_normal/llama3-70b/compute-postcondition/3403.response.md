Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10` and `piece` remains equal to 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Additionally, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged otherwise. If the condition does not hold, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `ncur`, `piece`, and `N` remain unchanged.***
