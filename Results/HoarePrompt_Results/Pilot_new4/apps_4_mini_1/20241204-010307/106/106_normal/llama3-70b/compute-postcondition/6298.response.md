The code appends the tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. Since `queue` is being updated with a new valid movement for `piece 2`, this means that it will now contain an additional entry, which reflects a new valid position and movement in the game.

The other variables (`dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and the other elements of `queue`) remain unchanged, and `piece` is still not equal to `i`.

Output State: **`dist[2]` is updated with the minimum distances for valid moves, `parent[2]` reflects the previous valid positions for those updates, `queue` contains an additional entry `(cur, i)`, and the value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
