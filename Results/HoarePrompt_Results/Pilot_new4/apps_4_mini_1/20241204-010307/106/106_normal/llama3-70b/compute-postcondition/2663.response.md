Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move generated by `dx` and `dy`, `parent[0][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
