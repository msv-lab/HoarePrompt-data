Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `A` is a valid two-dimensional array; `cur` is defined; `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point; `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move; `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy` where `dx` and `dy` take the next values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)] respectively.**
