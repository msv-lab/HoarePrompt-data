Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` and `dy` take on all values from the list [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `nx` and `ny` will be all calculated values based on the combinations of `x` and `dx`, `y` and `dy`; if within bounds, `ncur` will be set to corresponding values `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated if conditions are met, `parent[0][ncur]` will be set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` will contain all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples from the iterations; if the loop does not execute, no changes occur, and `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
