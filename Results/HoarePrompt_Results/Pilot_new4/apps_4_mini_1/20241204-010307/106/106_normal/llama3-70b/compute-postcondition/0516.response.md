Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `[0, N)`, then if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` is updated with the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
