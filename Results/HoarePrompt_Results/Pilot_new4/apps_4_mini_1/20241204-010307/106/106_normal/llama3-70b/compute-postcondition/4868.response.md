The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. Therefore, we can express `x` and `y` in terms of `nx` and `ny` as follows:

- `x = nx + 1`
- `y = ny + 1`

With the assignments made, we have:

- `nx` is updated to `nx + dx`
- `ny` is updated to `ny + dy`

Given that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, these conditions remain valid assuming that `dx` and `dy` result in values that do not violate these inequalities after the updates.

Thus, we can summarize the output state by including the current conditions of `N`, `dx`, `dy`, and the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; with the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` still holding true.**
