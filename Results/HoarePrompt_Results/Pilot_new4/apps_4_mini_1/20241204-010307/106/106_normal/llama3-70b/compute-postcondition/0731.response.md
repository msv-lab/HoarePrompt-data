Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `2 + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, then `ncur` is set to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the program state.***
