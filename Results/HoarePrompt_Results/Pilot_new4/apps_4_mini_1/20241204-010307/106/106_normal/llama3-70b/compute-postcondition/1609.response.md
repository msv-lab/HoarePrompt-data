Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1. If `nx` is within the bounds of 0 and N-1 and `ny` is within the bounds of 0 and N-1, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If these conditions are not met, there are no changes made to the variables.***
