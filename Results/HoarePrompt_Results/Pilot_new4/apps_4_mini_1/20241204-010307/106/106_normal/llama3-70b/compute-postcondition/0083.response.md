Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no updates made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
