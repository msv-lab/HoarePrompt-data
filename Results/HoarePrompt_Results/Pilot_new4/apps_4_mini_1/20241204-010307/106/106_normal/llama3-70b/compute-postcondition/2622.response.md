The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are not explicitly defined in the initial state but are assumed to have been previously assigned.

1. The variable `ncur` retains its value from `A[nx][ny]`.
2. The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to hold the value of `cur` and `piece`.

All other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, since none of them are directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `dx` must be (0, 1), `dy` must be (0, 1), `nx` is either `x` or `x + 1`, `ny` is either `y` or `y + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
