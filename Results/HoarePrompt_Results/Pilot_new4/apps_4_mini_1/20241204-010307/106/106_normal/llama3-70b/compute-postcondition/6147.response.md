Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not satisfied, no actions are taken.***
