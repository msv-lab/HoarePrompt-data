The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are now included in the `queue`, but no other variables are affected by this operation.

The relevant details from the initial state that remain valid are:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `y` is 1
- `x` is between 1 and `N-2`
- `nx` is between 2 and `N-1`
- `ny` is 1
- `dx` is 1
- `dy` is 0
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`
- `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`

Additionally, `queue` now contains a new tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is between 2 and `N-1`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`.**
