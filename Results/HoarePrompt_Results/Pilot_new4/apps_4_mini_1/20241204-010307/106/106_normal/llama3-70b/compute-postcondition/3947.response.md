The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `x` is initially 0, and `y` is also 0. The values of `dx` and `dy` will be taken from a list of tuples, but since the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine their exact contributions to `nx` and `ny`. Thus, `nx` will be equal to `dx`, and `ny` will be equal to `dy`.

Other variables remain unaffected, and the conditions regarding `N`, `A[0][0]`, and the range of `N` stay intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.**
