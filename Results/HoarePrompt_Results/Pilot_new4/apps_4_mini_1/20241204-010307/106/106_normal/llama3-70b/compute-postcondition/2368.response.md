The code assigns a new value to the variable `queue`, which is initialized as a deque containing a tuple with the values `(1, i)`. The value of `i` is unknown but will vary between `3` and `10`. The `queue` variable, which was previously empty, now holds a deque with one element. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point for each piece type, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for each `piece`, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (1, i), and `dist[i][1]` is 0.**
