The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The variable `nx` is currently 2 and `ny` is currently 0, so `ncur` will be equal to the element in the 2nd index of the first dimension and the 0th index of the second dimension of the array `A`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State will include the unchanged variables along with the assignment made to `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][0]`.**
