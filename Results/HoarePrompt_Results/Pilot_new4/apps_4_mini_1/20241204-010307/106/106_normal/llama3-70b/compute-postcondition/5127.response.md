Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, with `N` between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes occur.***
