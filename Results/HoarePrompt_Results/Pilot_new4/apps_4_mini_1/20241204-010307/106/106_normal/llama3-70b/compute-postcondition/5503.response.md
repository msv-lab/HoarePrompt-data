The code snippet assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `nx` becomes `x + dx` which equates to `4 + 1 = 5`. The variable `ny` becomes `y + dy` which equates to `2 + 0 = 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 5; `ny` is 2.**
