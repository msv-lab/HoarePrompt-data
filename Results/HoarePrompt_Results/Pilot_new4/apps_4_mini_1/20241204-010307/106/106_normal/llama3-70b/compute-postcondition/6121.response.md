The command `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected, but we note that the values of `ncur` and the number `2` are being used to populate the queue.

The `ncur` value is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`, which is derived from the given state, and it remains unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`.**
