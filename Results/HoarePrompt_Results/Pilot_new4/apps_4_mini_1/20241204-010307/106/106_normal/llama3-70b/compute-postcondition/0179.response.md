Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated according to the valid moves, `dist[2][ncur]` contains distances updated based on the conditions, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid `cur` and `piece` for those updates, and `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 2)` for all valid updates. Additionally, the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
