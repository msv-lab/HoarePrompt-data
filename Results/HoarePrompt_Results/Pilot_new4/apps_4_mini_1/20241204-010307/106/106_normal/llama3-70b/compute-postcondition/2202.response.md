According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the possible movements (dx, dy). Each iteration of the loop will process one of these movements. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has completed handling one of the movements, and we need to determine the next state.

Since the loop has a fixed number of iterations (in this case, 8, corresponding to the 8 movements), the loop will execute one more time for the next tuple in the list. If the loop has just completed processing the last tuple, then it will not execute again.

Assuming that the loop is currently on the first iteration with dx and dy set to (-2, -1), the next execution will involve the second tuple (-2, 1).

However, since the task states that the queue now contains one element `(ncur, 0)` in addition to the original element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, it is implied that the previous movement has been processed, and the loop is ready to process the next movement.

The current iteration state would be:
- `dx` and `dy` will take on the next values in the list, so for the next iteration, it will be dx = -2 and dy = 1.
- The loop will continue to maintain the same values for `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` unless changes are performed inside the loop body.

Since there's no direct numerical state that needs to change based on the provided information, we can conclude that the loop is about to process the next movement.

State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains one element `(ncur, 0)` in addition to the original element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, dx is -2, dy is 1**
