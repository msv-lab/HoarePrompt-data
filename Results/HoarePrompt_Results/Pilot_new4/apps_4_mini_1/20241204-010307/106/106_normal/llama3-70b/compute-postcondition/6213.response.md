Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dist[2]` contains the minimum distance values for piece 2 to all reachable cells, `parent[2]` contains the corresponding previous cells for all reachable cells, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(cur, i)`, while the current value of `piece` remains not equal to `i`.***
