Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)` based on the knight's moves.**
