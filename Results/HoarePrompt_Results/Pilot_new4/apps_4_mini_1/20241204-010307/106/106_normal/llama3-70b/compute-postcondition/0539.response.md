The code assigns the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`. This implies that the previous value at `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the current distance stored in `dist[0][cur]`. Since it is stated that `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` before this assignment, it indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and thus the relationship changes.

After executing the code, the following valid preconditions remain:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 0
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- the value of `piece` is 0

However, the value of `dist[0][ncur]` has now changed to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
