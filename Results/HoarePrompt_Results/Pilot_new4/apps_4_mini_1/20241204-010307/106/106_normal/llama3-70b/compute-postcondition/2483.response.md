Initial State: `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][-1]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.

```
queue.append((ncur, 0))
```
Now, `queue` is updated by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `0`. This operation does not alter the values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, or `parent`. The only change is the addition of a new element to `queue`.

Output State: **`N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][-1]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
