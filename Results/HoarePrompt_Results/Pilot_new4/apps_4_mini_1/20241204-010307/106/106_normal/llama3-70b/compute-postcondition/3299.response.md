Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[1]` contains the updated shortest distances from the starting position `(x, y)` to all reachable positions considering the knight's moves; `parent[1]` contains the updated parent positions of each reachable position based on the knight's moves; `queue` contains the tuples of positions that were valid and explored during the loop execution. If the conditions were never met during the loop execution, then `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
