The code appends a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous state indicates that `queue` already contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0), and the new tuple represents the updated state of the current index `ncur` with a new piece value of 1. The other variables are not impacted by this operation.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` initialized for valid `ncur`, `piece` is currently 1, `queue` now contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0) and one additional tuple (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than this new value, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now (cur, piece)**.
