The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[0][ncur]` remain unchanged, except for the assignment operation to `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`, but `cur` and `piece` are not specified, so they remain as is. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
