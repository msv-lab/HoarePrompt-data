The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. The specifics of `ncur` are dependent on the values of `nx`, `ny`, and the array `A`, but we know that `ncur` is the value at the position `[nx][ny]` in the array `A`. The value of `dist[1][ncur]` becomes `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged, but we can specify that `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
