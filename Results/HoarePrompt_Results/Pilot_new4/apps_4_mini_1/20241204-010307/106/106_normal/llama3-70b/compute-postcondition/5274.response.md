Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.***
