Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
