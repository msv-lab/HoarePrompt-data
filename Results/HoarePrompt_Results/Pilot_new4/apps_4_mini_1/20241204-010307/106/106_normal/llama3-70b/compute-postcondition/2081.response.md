According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy) for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]]`. The loop body is executed for each pair `(dx, dy)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, all the states are unchanged: `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain the same. However, we need to consider the number of iterations in the loop. Since there are four pairs in the list, the loop will run a total of four iterations, and after the last iteration, it will be ready to start again with the first pair.

After the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will be set to the last values of the last tuple in the list, which are `(0, 1)`. Since there are no more tuples left for the loop to iterate through, for the loop to execute one more time, it will not be able to, as it has exhausted all pairs.

Thus, the values of `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, but `dx` and `dy` will no longer have valid assignment pairs from the list. The for loop won't execute again unless `dx` and `dy` are reset or the list is modified.

State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` remains unchanged, `ny` remains unchanged, `ncur` remains unchanged, `dx` and `dy` indicate the last processed values `(0, 1)` (no more iterations).**
