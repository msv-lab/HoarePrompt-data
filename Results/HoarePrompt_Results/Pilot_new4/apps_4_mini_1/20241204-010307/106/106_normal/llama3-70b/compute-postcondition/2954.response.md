Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
