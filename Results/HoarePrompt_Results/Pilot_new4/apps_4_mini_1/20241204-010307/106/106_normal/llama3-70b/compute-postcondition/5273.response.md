The code appends a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `0` to the list `queue`. The initial state does not indicate the previous values or state of `queue`, so we cannot determine its content before the execution of this line. However, the new entry (`ncur`, `0`) will be added. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is used, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
