Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `A` must have dimensions that allow access to indices from `(x + dx, y + dy)` for each `dx, dy` in the list; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)` and `queue` contains a tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
