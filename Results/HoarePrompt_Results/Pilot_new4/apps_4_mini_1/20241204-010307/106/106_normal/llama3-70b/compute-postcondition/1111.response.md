Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are modified accordingly. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, or `ncur`.***
