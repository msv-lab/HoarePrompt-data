`nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. Since `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, this means `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will be `y`, which is 2. The value of `x` is constrained by `0 <= x < N`, and since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` can take any integer value from 0 to N-1. Therefore, `nx` will be a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to `N - 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, and `dx`, `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2**
