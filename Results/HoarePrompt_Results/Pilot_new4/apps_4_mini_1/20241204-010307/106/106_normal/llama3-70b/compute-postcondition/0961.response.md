In this code snippet, we are appending a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and we are focusing specifically on the impact of this operation.

The variables `ncur` and `2` are well-defined in this context, where `ncur` is derived from the earlier calculations based on `nx`, `ny`, and `A`. The previous values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
