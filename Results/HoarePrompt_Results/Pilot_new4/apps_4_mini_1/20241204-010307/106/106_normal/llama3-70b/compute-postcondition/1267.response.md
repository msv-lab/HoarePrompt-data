Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions based on conditions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken for those updated positions, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions that met the conditions, and `piece` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece), and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, these variables remain unchanged.***
