Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged if `piece` is equal to `i`; otherwise, `queue` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)` while `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged.***
