Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0. If `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances for reachable states from `(2, 0)` based on valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` stores the corresponding previous positions, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves plus the tuple `(cur, i)`, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, and `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates.***
