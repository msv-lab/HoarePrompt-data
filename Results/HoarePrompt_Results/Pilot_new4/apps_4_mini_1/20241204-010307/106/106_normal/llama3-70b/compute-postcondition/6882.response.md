Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, there are no changes made in the program.***
