The `queue` is updated to include a new tuple `(cur, i)`, while other variables remain unchanged. The state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` can now reflect this addition. Since no valid positions were found, the initial conditions about `dist`, `parent`, and the emptiness of `queue` remain valid until the new tuple is added.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid positions based on the grid `A`, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid state from `cur`, `queue` contains tuples of valid positions including the new addition `(cur, i)`, and the variable `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
