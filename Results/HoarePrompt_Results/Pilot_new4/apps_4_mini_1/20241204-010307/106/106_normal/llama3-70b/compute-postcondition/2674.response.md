The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The values for `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x - 1` and `y + 1`, respectively. Since `y` is initially `-1`, `ny` becomes `0`. The exact value of `nx` depends on the value of `x`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to `A[x - 1][0]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `0`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `0`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`**.
