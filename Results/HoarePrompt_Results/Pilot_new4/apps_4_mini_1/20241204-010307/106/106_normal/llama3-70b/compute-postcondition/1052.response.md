The value of `queue` is updated by appending a tuple `(cur, i)` to it. The initial values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The current value of `piece` is still not equal to `i`, indicating that the loop's conditions for executing further iterations are still valid. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distance from the position represented by `cur` to all valid `ncur` values, `parent[2][ncur]` records the corresponding `cur` and `piece` values for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`.**
