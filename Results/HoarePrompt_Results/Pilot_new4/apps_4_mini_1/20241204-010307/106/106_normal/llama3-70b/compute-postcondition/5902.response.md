The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the specific index `ncur` of the second list in the `parent` array. The value of `cur` remains unchanged, and `piece` is equal to 1. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `dist`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`) remain in their respective states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged, `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `parent[0]` stores tuples of previous indices leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for each valid move that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned `(cur, 1)`**.
