Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is updated, and `queue` now also contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, the program remains unchanged.***
