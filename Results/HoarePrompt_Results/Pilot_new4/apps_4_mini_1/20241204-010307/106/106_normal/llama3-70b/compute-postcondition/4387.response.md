Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 0)`, and `queue` now contains the element `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
