The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous value of `ncur` is `A[0][-1]`, but the values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is `A[0][-1]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is `A[0][-1]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`**.
