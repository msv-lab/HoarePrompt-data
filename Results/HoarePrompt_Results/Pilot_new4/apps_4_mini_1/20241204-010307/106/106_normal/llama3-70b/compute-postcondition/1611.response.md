According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple pairs `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. The loop will run through all these pairs. There are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing given the values of `dx` and `dy` in this specific context, as the loop is defined to iterate over a static list of pairs.

However, the initial states of `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` being unchanged suggest that if the loop does not execute, it implies some condition related to the context of the moves might not be met. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:

- The loop is guaranteed to go through all four pairs of `dx` and `dy`.
- The pairs suggest a movement pattern that likely interacts with the `dist` and `parent` arrays.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, it suggests there is a valid board or grid where the knight's moves can be applied. To guarantee the loop executes, we can simply state that the initial conditions are sufficient as is because the loop will run through the static pairs regardless of other variables.

Hence:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` are valid and can be modified, `queue` contains reachable cells**.
