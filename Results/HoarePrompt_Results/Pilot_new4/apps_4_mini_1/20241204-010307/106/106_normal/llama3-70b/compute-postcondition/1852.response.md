The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are unchanged after the execution. The states of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `nx`, `ny`, and `current values in dist` remain valid as per the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the distance to reach `ncur` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now `cur` with the value of `piece`.**
