Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[0][0]`. If `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and `N`, then if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `nx` and `ny` are out of bounds, no actions are performed.***
