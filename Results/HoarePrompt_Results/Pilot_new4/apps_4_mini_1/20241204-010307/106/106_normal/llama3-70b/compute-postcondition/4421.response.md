The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue` list. The values of `ncur` and `1` are now added to the existing `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `A` is a valid two-dimensional array; `cur` is defined; `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point; `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move; `queue` now contains all valid positions including `(ncur, 1)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy` where `dx` and `dy` take the next values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]; `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
