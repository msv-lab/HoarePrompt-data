The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. The variable `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1. Consequently, the calculations are as follows:

- For `nx`: 
  - `nx = x + (-2)` or `nx = x - 2`
- For `ny`: 
  - `ny = 2 + (-1)` or `ny = 2 - 1`
  - Thus, `ny = 1`

The variable `x` remains unchanged, but `nx` will be either `x - 2` depending on the value of `x`. The state of the other variables is not affected, except for the updates to `nx` and `ny`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 1.**
