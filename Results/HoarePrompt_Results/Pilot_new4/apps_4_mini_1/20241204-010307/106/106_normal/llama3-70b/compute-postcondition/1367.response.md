The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `2 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the values of `dx` and `dy`, but since their exact values are not provided in the initial state, we will keep them as expressions. 

The initial states of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and the new variable `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
