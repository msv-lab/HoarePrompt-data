Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the final y-coordinate possibly updated based on valid moves, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 2)` for all valid `ncur` reached from `(x, y)` where piece is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` for the updated valid `ncur` positions. Additionally, the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
