Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and if the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions are not satisfied, no changes are made to the state.***
