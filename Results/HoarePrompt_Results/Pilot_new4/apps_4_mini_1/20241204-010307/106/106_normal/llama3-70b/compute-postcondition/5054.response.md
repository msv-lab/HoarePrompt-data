The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`. Since `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, and are confirmed to be within the bounds of 0 to N, it can be inferred that `ncur` will reflect the value of `A` at those specific coordinates. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions, `queue` must contain at least one valid tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N.**
