Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 1. If the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are not met, then `ncur` is undefined due to out-of-bounds indexing. As a result, if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the assignments to `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` cannot be performed, leaving the `queue` to contain `(undefined, 0)`.***
