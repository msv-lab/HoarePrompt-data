Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid prior values, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the element `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
