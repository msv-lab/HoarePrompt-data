In the given code, `ncur` is already defined as equal to `A[0][-2]`, and now it will be added to the `queue` as part of a tuple along with `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][-2]`, `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is unchanged; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
