The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue` list. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the `queue.append()` operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `queue` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
