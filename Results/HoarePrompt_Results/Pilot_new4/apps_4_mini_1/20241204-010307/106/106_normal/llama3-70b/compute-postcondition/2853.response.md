Initial State: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is `y + 1`, pair is `(1, -1)`

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Now, let's evaluate the impact of the code on the program:

- `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`.
- `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`.
- The values of `dx` and `dy` are the first elements of the `pair`, which are `1` and `-1`, respectively. Hence, `dx = 1` and `dy = -1`.

Thus:
- `nx = x + 1`
- `ny = y - 1`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state will reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny` based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, pair is `(1, -1)`**
