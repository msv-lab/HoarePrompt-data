The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, along with the value of `piece`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx` (undefined), both `nx` is between 0 and N (exclusive), `ny` is between 0 and N (exclusive); `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`); `parent[0][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur`, and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx` (undefined), both `nx` is between 0 and N (exclusive), `ny` is between 0 and N (exclusive); `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`); `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
