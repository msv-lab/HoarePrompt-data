The operation `cur, piece = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost item from the `queue`, which is a valid tuple. The variables `cur` and `piece` will be updated with the values of that tuple. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and we do not have information about the specific values of `cur`, `piece`, or the tuple being removed from `queue`, but we know that `queue` will now have one less item.

Output State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`; `dist` contains the shortest distances from all reachable positions based on piece types; `parent` holds the predecessor tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` contains one less valid tuple; `cur` and `piece` are assigned the values from the removed tuple from `queue`.**
