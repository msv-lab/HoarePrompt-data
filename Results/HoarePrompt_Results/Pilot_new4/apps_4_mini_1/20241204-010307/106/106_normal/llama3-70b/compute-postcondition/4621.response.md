The assignment updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]`. Given the expression `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`, we can analyze the impact:

1. `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[2][cur]` plus 1.
2. The values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged except for the updated `dist` value.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][2]`, we are updating the distance for the specific next state represented by `ncur`. The previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` contains potential next states based on valid moves from the initial position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][2]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
