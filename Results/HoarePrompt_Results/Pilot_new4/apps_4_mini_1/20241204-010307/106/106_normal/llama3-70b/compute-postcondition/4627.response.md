In the given code, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The variables `dx` and `dy` are specified as `1` and `0`, respectively. 

Since `y` is initialized to `1`, we can determine the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current state of `x` and `y`.

- `nx = x + 1` (since `dx` = 1)
- `ny = 1 + 0` (since `dy` = 0, so `ny` remains `1`)

The values of `N`, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while retaining the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` must include the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1.**
