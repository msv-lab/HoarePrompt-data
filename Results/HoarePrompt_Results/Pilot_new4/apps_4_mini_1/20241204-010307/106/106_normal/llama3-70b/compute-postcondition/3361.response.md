Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, `parent[0][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` appended for each valid move resulting in an update to `dist[0][ncur]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1 for the first iteration, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, and the values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is true.***
