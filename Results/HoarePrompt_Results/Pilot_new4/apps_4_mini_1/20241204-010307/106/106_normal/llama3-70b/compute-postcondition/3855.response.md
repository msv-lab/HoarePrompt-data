In the given code snippet, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, meaning we can't compute their impact on `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, we can only note that the values of `nx` and `ny` become dependent on the unknown values of `dx` and `dy`.

The initial states of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, while `nx` and `ny` are introduced as new variables dependent on `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`**
