The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are both calculated as `0 + dx` and `0 + dy`, respectively. Therefore, `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `dx` and `dy`. The value of `A[nx][ny]` is determined based on the values of `nx` and `ny`, and since `N` is between 3 and 10, `A` is likely a 2D array with dimensions that accommodate these indices.

The initial state of `ncur` is updated to reflect this assignment. The states of the other variables are not affected, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `piece` is equal to 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
