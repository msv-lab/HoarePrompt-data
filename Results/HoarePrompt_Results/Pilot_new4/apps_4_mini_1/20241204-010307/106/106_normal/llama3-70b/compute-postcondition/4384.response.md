The code assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. Since it is given that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this assignment will make `dist[0][ncur]` equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and it will no longer be greater than it after the execution. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which is now not greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
