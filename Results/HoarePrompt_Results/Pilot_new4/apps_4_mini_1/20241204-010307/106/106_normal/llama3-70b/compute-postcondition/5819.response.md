Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, and if `piece` is 1 and the condition `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` holds, the new tuple `(ncur, 1)` will be included. Additionally, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` are updated for all valid `ncur`, while `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is -1; if the indices `nx` and `ny` are within bounds, the respective updates may occur; otherwise, `ncur` is not assigned a valid value due to out-of-bounds access. If `piece` is 1 and the distances condition holds, then `dist[1][ncur]` becomes `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 1)`.***
