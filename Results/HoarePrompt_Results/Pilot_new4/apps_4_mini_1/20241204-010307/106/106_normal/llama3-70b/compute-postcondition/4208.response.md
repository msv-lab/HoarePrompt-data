The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since `x` is initially 1 and `y` is equal to `N - 1`, their new values will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. The initial state also confirms that `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, which implies that `y` will be at least 2 (when `N` is 3) and at most 9 (when `N` is 10). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent` contains parent information, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable points, and the indices `nx` and `ny` must satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
