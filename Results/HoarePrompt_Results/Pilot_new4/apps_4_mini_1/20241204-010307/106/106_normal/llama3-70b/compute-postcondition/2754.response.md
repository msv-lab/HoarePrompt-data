The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous state indicates that `cur` is the current position in the path, and `piece` is equal to 1. The variable `ncur` is determined from the grid using `A[nx][ny]`. The states of other variables such as `N`, `y`, `dist`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `piece` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` holds the shortest distance from the start to all reachable positions in the grid, `parent[0][ncur]` indicates the predecessor of each position in the path, `queue` contains the tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.**
