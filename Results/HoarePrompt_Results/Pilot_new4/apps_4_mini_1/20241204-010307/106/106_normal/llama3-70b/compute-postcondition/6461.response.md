The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` implies that a specific value from the `dist` array is being updated. However, in the given state, we do not have the value of `cur`, and thus the exact computation cannot be determined. 

The impact of executing this line is that `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned a new value based on an unspecified `cur`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, and `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple.**
