The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` have been previously updated to `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Therefore, after executing the code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`, we will have `nx` equal to the new value of `x` and `ny` equal to the new value of `y`. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` has been updated to `x + dx`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dist[0]` has been updated for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(1, 0)`, `parent[0]` is set accordingly for those positions, `queue` contains the previous tuples of all valid `ncur` positions along with `0` for piece, the tuple `(ncur, 1)` has been appended, distances from `dist[0][cur]` reflect the minimum steps required to reach each position from `(1, 0)`, tuples for (dx, dy) are valid for execution, piece equals `1`, `dist[1][ncur]` equals `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 1)` if `piece` equals `1` and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y`.**
