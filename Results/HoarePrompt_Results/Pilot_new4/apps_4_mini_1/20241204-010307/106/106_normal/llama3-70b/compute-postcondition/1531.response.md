The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is 1 and `ny` is 1. The values of `A` at the indices `[1][1]` will depend on the defined values in the matrix `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated variable `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is A[1][1].**
