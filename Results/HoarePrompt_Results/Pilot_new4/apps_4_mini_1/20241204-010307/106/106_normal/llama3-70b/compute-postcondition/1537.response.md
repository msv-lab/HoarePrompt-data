According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples of (dx, dy) values. At the end of the last iteration, the values of (dx, dy) were -1 and -1 respectively (the first tuple in the list). For the loop to execute one more time, it will move to the next tuple in the list.

The next tuple in the list is (-1, 1), so `dx` will be updated to -1 and `dy` will be updated to 1.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1.**
