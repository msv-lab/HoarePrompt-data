The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `A` is presumably a 2D array or list. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are still valid, and since `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and `N`, the assignment is valid. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` must not be empty to ensure valid moves exist, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
