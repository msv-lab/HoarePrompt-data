The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given the initial state, `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, while `dx` and `dy` are assumed to be defined within the allowable bounds, meaning that the result for `nx` and `ny` will depend on these values. However, since the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine exact numerical results for `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, we express them in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

The output state will reflect the updated values for `nx` and `ny`, while retaining all other state information.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` contains minimum distances, `parent` contains respective parents, `queue` contains reachable positions and piece types based on movement rules, value of A[x][y] is equal to cur, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and `x + dx` and `y + dy` must be within valid bounds of A.**
