In the provided code snippet, the line `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`. Since `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][N - 2]`, this means that the specific indices of `parent` will now hold the value of `cur`.

The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][N - 2]`. The other variables are not directly affected by the assignment to `parent`.

Therefore, the output state indicates that `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the value of `cur`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N - 2`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][N - 2]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, piece.**
