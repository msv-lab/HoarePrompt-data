The code snippet appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are added to the `queue`, but no other variables are modified. Thus, the output state reflects the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
