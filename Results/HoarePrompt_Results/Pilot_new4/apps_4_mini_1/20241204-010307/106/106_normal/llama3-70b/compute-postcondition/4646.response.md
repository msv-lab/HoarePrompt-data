The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The prior values of `cur` and `piece` were not specified, but it is understood that `cur` is a valid index in the context of `parent` and `ncur`. 

The relevant information from the initial state is kept intact, and we only update the `parent` variable.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (which is less than its previous value), and `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.**
