Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece == 1` and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, and `ncur` equals `A[nx][ny]`, ensuring that `dist[1][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
