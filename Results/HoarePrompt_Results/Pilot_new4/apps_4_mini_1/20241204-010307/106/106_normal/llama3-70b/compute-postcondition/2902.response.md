The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, along with the value of `piece`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and since `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state but are assumed to have values, we can simply indicate that `parent[0][ncur]` is now assigned these values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, with `dist[0][ncur]` now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations, `x` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `N + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0.**
