The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged except for the `queue`, which will now include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ny` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
