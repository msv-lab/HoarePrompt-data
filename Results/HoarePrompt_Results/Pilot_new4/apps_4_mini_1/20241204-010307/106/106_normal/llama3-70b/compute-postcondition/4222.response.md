The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N]`, and it is appended to the `queue` along with `0`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
