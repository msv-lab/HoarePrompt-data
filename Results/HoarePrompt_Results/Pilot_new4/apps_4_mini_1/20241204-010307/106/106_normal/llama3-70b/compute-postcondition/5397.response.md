Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `piece` is 1; `dist[1]` contains updated distances based on valid moves; `parent[1]` contains path information for those moves; `queue` includes tuples representing valid moves made from the original position `(cur, 0)` to new positions with `piece` 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all applicable `ncur` values where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If no valid moves were available, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
