Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)`, `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)`, and `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from `(1, 0)` with the tuple `(cur, i)` appended to `queue` if `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` equals `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized values.***
