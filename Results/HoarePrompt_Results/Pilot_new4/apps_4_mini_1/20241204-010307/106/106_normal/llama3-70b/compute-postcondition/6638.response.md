The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged, and the state of the `queue` is updated to include the new position.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**
