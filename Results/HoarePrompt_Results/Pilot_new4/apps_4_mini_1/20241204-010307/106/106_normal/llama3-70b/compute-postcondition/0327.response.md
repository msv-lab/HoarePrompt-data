To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop condition. The loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the directions to move in a grid.

1. The loop iterates over a predefined list of direction tuples `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, which contains 4 elements. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly 4 times, regardless of the current state of other variables.

2. Since the loop does not depend on any conditions outside of the predefined list, there are no restrictions that need to be validated for the loop to execute.

3. The loop variables `dx` and `dy` will take the values of the elements in the tuple pairs during each iteration. They do not need to be initialized or adjusted beforehand.

In summary, the loop can execute with the provided state without needing to alter any existing variables, as the loop is independent of the values of `N`, `y`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to reflect the shortest distance from `cur` for each valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece's position for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the direction tuples in the loop**.
