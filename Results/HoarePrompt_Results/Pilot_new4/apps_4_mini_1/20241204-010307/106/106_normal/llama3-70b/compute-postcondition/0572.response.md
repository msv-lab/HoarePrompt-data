In the given code, `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. We know that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -1, so `nx` becomes `x - 1` and `ny` becomes `y - 1`.

The initial state has the following constraints:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 0
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `piece` is 1
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -1

Now, substituting the values of `dx` and `dy` into the expressions for `nx` and `ny`:
- `nx = x - 1`
- `ny = 0 - 1 = -1`

All other variables remain unchanged. The final output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, along with the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1**
