The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updated `queue` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates parents for each `ncur`, `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `current value of dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
