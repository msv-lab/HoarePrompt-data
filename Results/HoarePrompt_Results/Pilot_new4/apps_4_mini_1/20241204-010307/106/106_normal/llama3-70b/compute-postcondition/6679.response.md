Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `-1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0; if `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` may be added to `queue`; `ncur` remains equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
