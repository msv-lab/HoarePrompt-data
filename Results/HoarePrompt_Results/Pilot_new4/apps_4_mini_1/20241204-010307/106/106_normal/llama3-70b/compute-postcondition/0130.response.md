The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The preconditions indicate that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, meaning the assignment will hold true after execution, as the new value will be equal to the previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` and both are less than `N`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
