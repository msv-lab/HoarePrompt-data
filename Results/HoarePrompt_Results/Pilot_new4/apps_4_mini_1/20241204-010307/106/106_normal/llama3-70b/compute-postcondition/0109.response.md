The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variable `y` equals `N`, so `ny` will be `N + dy`. Given that both `nx` and `ny` must remain between 0 and N (exclusive), the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `x`, `dx`, `dy`, and the specific value of `N`. The states of the other variables (`piece`, `ncur`, and `cur`) remain unchanged. 

Since `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, `y` will be equal to `N`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny` while retaining the information about the bounds of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), `piece` equals 0, `ncur` and `cur` are unchanged.**
