Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 1. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur` and `piece` is not equal to `i`, the `queue` now contains the previously appended elements plus the new element `(cur, i)`, while `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur` and `piece` is equal to `i`, no changes are made to the `queue`, `dist`, or `parent`.***
