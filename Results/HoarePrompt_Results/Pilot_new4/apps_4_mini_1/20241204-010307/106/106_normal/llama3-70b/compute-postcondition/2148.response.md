The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are computed based on previous operations, but no other variables are directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current conditions of the relevant variables while noting that `queue` has been modified.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is initialized for valid `ncur`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
