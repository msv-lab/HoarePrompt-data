The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `cur` is connected to the current position and `piece` is equal to 1, after execution, `parent[1][ncur]` will now hold the value of `cur` and `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` is updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` stores the previous position and piece for each reachable position, `queue` contains all the valid `(ncur, 0)` positions, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
