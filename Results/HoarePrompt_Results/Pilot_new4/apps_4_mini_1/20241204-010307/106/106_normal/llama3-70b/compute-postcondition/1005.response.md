Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` with `dist[1][ncur]` having decreased from its previous value, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, if the condition `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` is true. If the condition is false, then no changes occur to the state of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
