Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; 0 ≤ `nx`, `ny` < `N`. If the condition `0 ≤ nx < N and 0 ≤ ny < N` is satisfied, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and the `queue` contains `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
