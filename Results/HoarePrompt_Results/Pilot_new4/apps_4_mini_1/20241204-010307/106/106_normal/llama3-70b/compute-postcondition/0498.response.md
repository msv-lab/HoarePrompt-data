Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[1]` reflects the minimum distances updated based on valid moves from the initial state, `parent[1]` contains the connections made for valid moves, and `queue` contains all tuples of nodes added during the loop execution. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` will remain unchanged from their initial states.**
