The `queue` variable is updated by appending a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to it. The values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`**
