The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. It does not change any of the existing variables but modifies the `queue` by adding a new element. 

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
