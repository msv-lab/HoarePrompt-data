The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` sets the value of `parent[2][ncur]` to a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece`. Given the previous state, we know `piece` is equal to 2. Therefore, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, 2)`, which means it now holds the values of `cur` and `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; the current value of `dist[2][cur]` is less than the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`**.
