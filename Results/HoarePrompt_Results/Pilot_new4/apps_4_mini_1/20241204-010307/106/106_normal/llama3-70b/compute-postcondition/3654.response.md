The operation `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a new tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 

The input state indicates that `queue` must contain valid tuples, and now it includes the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`. The other variables retain their values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` contains valid tuples including `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
