According to the code, the loop iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing the changes in `x` and `y` coordinates (i.e., `dx` and `dy`). In this case, the loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 1, and `N` is between 3 and 10, meaning that `nx` (calculated as `x + dx`) and `ny` (calculated as `1 + dy`) must remain within the bounds defined by `N` for the loop to continue executing. 

Given that `dx` and `dy` are derived from the list of tuples, the loop will continue executing as long as there are additional tuples remaining in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nx` and `ny` have already been computed based on the current values of `x` and `y`. When the loop runs for the next tuple in the list, the values of `dx` and `dy` will change accordingly. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that the next tuple will be processed, and we must ensure that `nx` and `ny` remain valid. Since there are 8 tuples in total in the list, and since we are currently processing the first tuple, after the next iteration, we will be processing the second tuple.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for the second tuple; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy` for the second tuple; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
