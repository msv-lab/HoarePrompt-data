Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, and `ny` is 0. If `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, and `piece` is 2 with `dist[2][ncur]` greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. If these conditions are not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
