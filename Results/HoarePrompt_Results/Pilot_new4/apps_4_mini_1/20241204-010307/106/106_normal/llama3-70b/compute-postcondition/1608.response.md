Postcondition: ***If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If these conditions are not met, there are no changes made to the variables.***
