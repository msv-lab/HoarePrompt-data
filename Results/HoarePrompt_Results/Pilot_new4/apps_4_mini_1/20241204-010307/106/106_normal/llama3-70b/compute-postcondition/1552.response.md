Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned `A[nx][ny]`, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
