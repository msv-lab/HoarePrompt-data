The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `0` are now being added to the `queue`, which was previously undefined in the initial state provided. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

The final output state will include the current values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `A`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` along with the updated information about the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `piece` is equal to 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to (cur, piece); `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
