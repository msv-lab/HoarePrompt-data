The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now includes an additional element which represents the current position in the grid `ncur` with a piece value of `2`. The previous values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates the predecessors of each position in the path, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 2)`**.
