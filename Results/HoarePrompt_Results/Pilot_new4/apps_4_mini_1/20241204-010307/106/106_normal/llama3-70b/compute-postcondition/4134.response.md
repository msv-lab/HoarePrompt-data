Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 4. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
