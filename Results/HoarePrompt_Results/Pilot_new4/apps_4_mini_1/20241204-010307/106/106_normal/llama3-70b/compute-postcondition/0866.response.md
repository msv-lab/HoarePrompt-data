The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the indices `[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, so they remain unspecified. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Thus, we maintain all the existing variable states and simply note the assignment to `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-1][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`.**
