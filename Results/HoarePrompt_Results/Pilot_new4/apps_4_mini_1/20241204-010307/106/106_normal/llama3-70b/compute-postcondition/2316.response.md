The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the calculations involving `dx` and `dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1, the calculations will be as follows:

- `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, which is `x - 1`.
- `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, which is `y + 1`.

Since the initial values of `nx` and `ny` were defined as `nx = x - 1` and `ny = y`, we can note that:

- The value of `nx` remains unchanged (`nx` is still equal to `x - 1`).
- The value of `ny` will now be equal to `y + 1`.

The states of the other variables (`dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
