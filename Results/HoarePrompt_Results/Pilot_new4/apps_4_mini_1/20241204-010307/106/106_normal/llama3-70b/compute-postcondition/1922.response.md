The `queue` is being updated by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `2`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are already defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` contains a tuple of `(ncur, 2)`.**
