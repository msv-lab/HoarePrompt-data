The code adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are not altered by this operation, and the other variables remain unaffected as well. The states of the other variables are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` has been appended to `queue`.**
