According to the code, the loop iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing changes in coordinates (`dx`, `dy`). At the end of the last iteration, the variables `dx` and `dy` are -2 and -1, respectively, corresponding to the first tuple in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the list will be used. 

The order of tuples is as follows:
1. `(-2, -1)`
2. `(-2, 1)`
3. `(-1, -2)`
4. `(-1, 2)`
5. `(1, -2)`
6. `(1, 2)`
7. `(2, -1)`
8. `(2, 1)`

Since the current tuple is `(-2, -1)` and `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the next tuple in the list, they will become `(-2, 1)` in the next iteration.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect this. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `A[0][0]`, `cur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the iteration over the tuples. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1` and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**
