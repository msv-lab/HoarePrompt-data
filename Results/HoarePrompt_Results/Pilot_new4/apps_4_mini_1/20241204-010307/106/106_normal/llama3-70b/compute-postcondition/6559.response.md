Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, and if `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` remains unchanged, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
