The code updates the `parent` array at index `[2][ncur]` to hold the values of `cur` and `piece`. The previous state does not change any other variables apart from `parent`. The value of `ncur` is already defined as `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `dist[2][cur]` are unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`**.
