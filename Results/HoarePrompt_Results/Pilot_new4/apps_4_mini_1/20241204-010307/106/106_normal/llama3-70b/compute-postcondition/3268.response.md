The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unaffected. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][0]`, but we do not have the specific values for `cur`, `piece`, or the entries of `A`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][0]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
