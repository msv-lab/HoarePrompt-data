Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`; if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.***
