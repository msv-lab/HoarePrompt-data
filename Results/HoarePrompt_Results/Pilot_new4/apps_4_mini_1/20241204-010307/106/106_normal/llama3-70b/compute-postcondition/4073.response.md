The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the position `[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly given in the initial state, but we know that `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
