The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]` based on the previous values. The variable `cur` is used in the assignment but is not defined in the initial state. However, since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, that means `parent[2][ncur]` will now hold the value of `cur` along with `piece`. Other variables remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x`; `ny` is between 1 and 9 (inclusive); `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
