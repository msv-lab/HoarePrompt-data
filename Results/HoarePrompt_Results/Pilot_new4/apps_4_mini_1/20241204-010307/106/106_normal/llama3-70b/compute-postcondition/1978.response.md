The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Since `nx` is equal to `x + 1` and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, the value of `ncur` is determined by the values of `A` at these derived indices. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as per the initial conditions, so the output state reflects the assignment to `ncur` along with the retained values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains unchanged, `dist` and `parent` states remain as they are, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y - 1]`.**
