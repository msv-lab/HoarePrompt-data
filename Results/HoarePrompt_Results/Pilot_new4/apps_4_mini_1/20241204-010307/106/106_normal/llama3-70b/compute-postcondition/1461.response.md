The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y` along with the `dx` and `dy` offsets. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, while `nx` and `ny` are computed as follows:

- `nx` is calculated by adding `dx` to `x`, resulting in `nx = 2 + dx`.
- `ny` is calculated by adding `dy` to `y`, resulting in `ny = 1 + dy`.

Since `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, they will remain as variables. The values of `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` contains tuples of cells added for processing based on valid moves.**
