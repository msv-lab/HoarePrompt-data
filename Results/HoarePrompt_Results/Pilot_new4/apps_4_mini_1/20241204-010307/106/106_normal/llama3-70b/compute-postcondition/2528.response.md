The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
