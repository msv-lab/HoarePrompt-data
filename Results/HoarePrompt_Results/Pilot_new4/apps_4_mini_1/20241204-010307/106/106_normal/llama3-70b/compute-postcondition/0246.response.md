Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value (cur, piece), and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
