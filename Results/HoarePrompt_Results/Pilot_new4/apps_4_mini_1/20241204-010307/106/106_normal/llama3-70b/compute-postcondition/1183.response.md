The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are both 1, while `nx` and `ny` can either be 0 or 2 depending on the updates from `dx` and `dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected, but `nx` and `ny` will change based on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1 + dx, `ny` is 1 + dy**.
