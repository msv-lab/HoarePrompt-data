The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`. The right side of the assignment references `dist[0][cur]` and increments it by 1. The variables `ncur` and `cur` must be evaluated based on their previous context.

Initially, we have:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 9
- `y` is 9
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -2
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is 7
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][7]`

The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, but the values of `dist[0][cur]` and `cur` are not provided; thus, we cannot determine specific values for those. However, since the assignment adds 1 to `dist[0][cur]`, we know that `dist[0][ncur]` now holds the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The output state retains all previous variables and conditions while updating just what has changed:

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9; `y` is 9; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 7; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][7]; dist[0][ncur] is equal to dist[0][cur] + 1.**
