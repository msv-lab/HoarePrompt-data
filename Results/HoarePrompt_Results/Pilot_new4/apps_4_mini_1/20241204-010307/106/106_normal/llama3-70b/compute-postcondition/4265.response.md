Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
