Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `piece` is set to 2, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point, `parent[2][ncur]` holds the corresponding previous positions, and `queue` includes the tuple `(cur, i)` along with all previously existing elements. If `piece` equals `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized states.***
