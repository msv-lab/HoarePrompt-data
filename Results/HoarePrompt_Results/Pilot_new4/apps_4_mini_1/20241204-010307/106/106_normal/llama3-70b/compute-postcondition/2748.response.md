According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing directional changes in the grid (dx, dy). For the loop to execute, it requires that the list is not empty. The list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]` is fixed and contains four elements, so it will always execute at least once. 

However, the variables `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself, but they may influence what happens inside the loop. Therefore, there are no necessary adjustments to be made to these states in order for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state remains as it is because it is sufficient to enter the loop. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `dist[0][ncur]` holds the shortest distance from the start to all reachable positions in the grid, `parent[0][ncur]` indicates the predecessor of each position in the path, `queue` contains the tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values.**
