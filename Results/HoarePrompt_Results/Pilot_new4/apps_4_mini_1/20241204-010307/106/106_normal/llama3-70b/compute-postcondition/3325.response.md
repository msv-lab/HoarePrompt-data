Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`. If the condition is false, there is no action taken.***
