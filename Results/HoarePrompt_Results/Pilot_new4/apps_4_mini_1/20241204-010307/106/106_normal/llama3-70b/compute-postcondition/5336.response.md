Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is 5; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
