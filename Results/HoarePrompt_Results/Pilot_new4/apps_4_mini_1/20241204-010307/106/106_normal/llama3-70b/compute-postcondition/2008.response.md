The operation `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and 2 to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged and their states are still valid after this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` remains 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
