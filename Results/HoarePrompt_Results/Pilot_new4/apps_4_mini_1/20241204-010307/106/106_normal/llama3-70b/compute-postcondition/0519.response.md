The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `2`. Given that `ny` is `2`, the value of `ncur` will depend on the specific value of `nx`, which is calculated as `x - 1`. Since `x` can take any integer value in the range `0 <= x < N`, `nx` can take values from `-1` to `N - 2`. 

The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`.**
