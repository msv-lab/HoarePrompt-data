Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (i.e., the current value of `nx` is -2 which is not within the range and the current value of `ny` is 0 which is within the range).***
