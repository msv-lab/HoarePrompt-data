Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which is no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
