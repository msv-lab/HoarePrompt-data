Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, and `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to `N - 1`, then if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to its previous contents. If `nx` or `ny` are out of bounds, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
