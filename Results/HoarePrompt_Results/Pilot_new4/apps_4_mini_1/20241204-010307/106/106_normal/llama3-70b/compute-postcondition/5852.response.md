The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the existing `queue`. The variables `ncur`, `piece`, and `queue` are directly affected by this operation. 

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[2][0]` and `piece` is 2, the new tuple being added to `queue` will contain the value of `ncur` and the piece value of 2. The initial state of `queue` is not explicitly defined but it is mentioned to contain at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`.

The output state will retain all the previous conditions that are still valid, and only the `queue` will be updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)` and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[2][0]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
