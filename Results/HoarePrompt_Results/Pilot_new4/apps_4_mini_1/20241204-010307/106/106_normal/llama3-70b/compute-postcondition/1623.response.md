The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The specific value of `ncur` depends on the values of `nx` and `ny`, which are influenced by `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Therefore, `ncur` will be determined by accessing the element at the coordinates `[nx][ny]` of array `A`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` remains unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
