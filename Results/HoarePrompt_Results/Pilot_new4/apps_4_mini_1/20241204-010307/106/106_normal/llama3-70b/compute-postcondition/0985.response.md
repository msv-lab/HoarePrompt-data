The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `queue` are directly impacted by this operation. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, but since we don't have specific values for `A` or `queue`, we will represent `ncur` with its expression. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
