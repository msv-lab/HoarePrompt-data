The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state provides that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`. 

However, the specifics about what `ncur`, `cur`, and `queue` are in terms of their existing values or states are not provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value (cur, piece), and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
