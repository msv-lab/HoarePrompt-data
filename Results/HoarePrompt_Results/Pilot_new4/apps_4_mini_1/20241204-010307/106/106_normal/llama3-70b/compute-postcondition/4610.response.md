Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` must contain potential next states based on valid moves from the initial position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
