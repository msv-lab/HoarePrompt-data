According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` contains all valid tuples appended during the loop execution. Since the condition is simply `while queue:`, for the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must not be empty. 

However, we do not have any information about the contents of `queue` at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, we cannot determine if any adjustments are needed based on the current state. Nonetheless, since the problem states that `queue` contains all valid tuples appended during the loop execution, we can infer that `queue` must have at least one valid tuple for the loop to proceed.

Thus, we can say that `queue` must contain at least one valid tuple.

State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`; `dist` contains the shortest distances from all reachable positions based on piece types; `parent` holds the predecessor tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` must contain at least one valid tuple.**
