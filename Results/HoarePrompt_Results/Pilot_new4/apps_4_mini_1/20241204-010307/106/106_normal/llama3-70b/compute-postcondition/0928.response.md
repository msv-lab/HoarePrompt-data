Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
