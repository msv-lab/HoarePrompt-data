Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `nx` is `x + dx` where `dx` is within bounds; `ny` is `y + dy` where `dy` is within bounds; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
