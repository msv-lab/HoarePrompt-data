Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` is `A[x - 1][-1]`. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`.***
