The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, which is calculated as `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The previous condition states that the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, indicating that the update will lower the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N - 1` (inclusive), `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
