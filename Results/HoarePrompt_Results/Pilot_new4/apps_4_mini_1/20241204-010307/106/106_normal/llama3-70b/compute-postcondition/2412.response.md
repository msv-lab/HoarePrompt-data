The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are both -1, which means `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will be `y - 1`. The variable `y` is initially 0, so `ny` will become `0 - 1`, which is -1. The value of `x` is not given, but `nx` will be `x - 1`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1**
