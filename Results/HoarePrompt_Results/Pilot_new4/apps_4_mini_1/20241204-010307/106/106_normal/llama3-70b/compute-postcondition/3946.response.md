According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional changes (`dx`, `dy`). The execution of the loop does not depend on the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, or `A[0][0]`, since the loop is independent of these variables. 

However, the state of `x` and `y` should be initialized for the loop to operate accurately based on the context of the loop body that is omitted. Since the loop iterates over the predefined directional changes, no adjustments are strictly required for the loop to execute. Therefore, we can indicate that `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the tuples in the specified order.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples**
