The code updates the `dist` array at index `[0][ncur]` to be equal to the value at `dist[0][cur]` plus 1. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `dist` are affected by this operation. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`, we know that the specific value of `ncur` can be determined from the values of `A` at that specific index.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated.
- `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged.
- The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` will remain as described since the code does not change them.

Therefore, after executing the code, we will have the updated state of `dist[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
