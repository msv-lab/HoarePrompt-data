According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in coordinates (`dx`, `dy`). Each iteration of the loop updates `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute again for each tuple in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the current values are as follows:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.
- `dx` is -2.
- `dy` is 1.
- `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which results in `-2`.
- `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which results in `1`.

The loop will execute again for the next tuple in the list of coordinate changes. The next tuple after `(-2, 1)` is `(-1, -2)`. Therefore, we need to adjust `dx` and `dy` to be `-1` and `-2`, respectively.

For the next iteration, we calculate:
- `nx` as `x + dx = 0 + (-1) = -1`.
- `ny` as `y + dy = 0 + (-2) = -2`.

However, since `dx` and `dy` are changing with each iteration, they will take the values of the next tuple as we move through the list. The next iteration will not require any modifications to `N` or other states because it will simply proceed with the next values.

For the loop to execute one more time with the updated values:
- `dx` is now `-1`.
- `dy` is now `-2`.
- `nx` will be `-1`.
- `ny` will be `-2`.

No other state needs to change since `N`, `x`, `y`, `A[0][0]`, and the conditions for `dist` and `piece` remain the same.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -2**
