The line `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are unchanged, and the other variables remain unaffected. The state of `queue` will now include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` has been appended to `queue`.**
