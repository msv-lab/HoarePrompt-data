The statement `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the list `queue`. The value of `ncur` is already established as being equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` has been assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`**.
