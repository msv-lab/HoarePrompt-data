The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are given as `-1` and `1`, respectively. Therefore, `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `y + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`**.
