The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, and the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are not specified in the initial state. Thus, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are also unaffected. Therefore, the output state will include the new values of `nx` and `ny`, expressed in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) with `(cur, i)` appended to `queue` if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy**.
