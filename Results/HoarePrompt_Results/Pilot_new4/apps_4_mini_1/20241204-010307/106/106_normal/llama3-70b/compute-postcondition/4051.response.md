In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the existing values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is 0
- `dx` is -1
- `y` is 1
- `dy` is -2

Calculating their new values:
- `nx` becomes `0 + (-1)`, which equals `-1`.
- `ny` becomes `1 + (-2)`, which equals `-1`.

Thus, after executing the code, the variables `nx` and `ny` will have the values of `-1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1.**
