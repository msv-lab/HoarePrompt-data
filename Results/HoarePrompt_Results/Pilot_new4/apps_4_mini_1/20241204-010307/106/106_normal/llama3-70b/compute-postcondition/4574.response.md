The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are given as follows: `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is -1. Thus, `ncur` will depend on the specific values in the 2D list `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. Since `A` is not defined in terms of specific values in the initial state, the output state will mention that `ncur` is now equal to `A[nx][-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`.**
