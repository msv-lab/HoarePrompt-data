Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes to the state of the program.***
