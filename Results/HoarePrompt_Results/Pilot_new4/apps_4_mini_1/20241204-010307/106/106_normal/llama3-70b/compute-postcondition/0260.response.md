The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `iteration count` remain unchanged. The `parent[2][ncur]` variable is now updated with the new values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; iteration count is 4; it cannot execute again without changes.**
