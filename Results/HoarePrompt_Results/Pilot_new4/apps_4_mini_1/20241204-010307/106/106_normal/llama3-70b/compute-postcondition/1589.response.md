The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The condition for entering the if statement is satisfied, indicating that the distance from the starting point to `ncur` is indeed greater than the distance from the starting point to `cur` plus 1. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `A[nx][ny]`, `dx`, `dy`, and `piece` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[nx][ny]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` and `dy` take values from the list of tuples in each iteration, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
