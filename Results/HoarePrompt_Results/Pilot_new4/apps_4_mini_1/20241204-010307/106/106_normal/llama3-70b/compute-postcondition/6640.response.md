Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, and `queue` may include the next position accordingly. If the conditions are not met (`0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`), there are no changes to the variables.***
