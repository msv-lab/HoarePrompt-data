In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `N` is at least 4, and `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `piece` remain unchanged as per the context.

Since `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. However, we can conclude that `nx` and `ny` are defined as new positions based on the current position `(x, y)` and the changes `(dx, dy)`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where the conditions are met, `piece` remains unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
