The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, and `ny` are constrained by their defined ranges and the expressions provided. 

Since `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, the new values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

Given that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `y` is between 1 and `N-2`,
- `x` is between 1 and `N-2`,
- `nx` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`,
- `ny` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`,

The new values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
