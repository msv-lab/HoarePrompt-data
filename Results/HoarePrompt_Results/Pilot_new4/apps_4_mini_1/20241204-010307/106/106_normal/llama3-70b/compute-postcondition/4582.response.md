The statement `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

- The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, but it could represent a position or a coordinate. 
- The variable `y` is defined as `1`.
- The variables `dx` and `dy` are assumed to hold values that represent a change in the x and y coordinates, respectively.

After executing the code, `nx` will be equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` will be equal to `1 + dy`.

The states of `N`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[0]` contains parent relationships for valid moves, and `queue` contains potential next states.**
