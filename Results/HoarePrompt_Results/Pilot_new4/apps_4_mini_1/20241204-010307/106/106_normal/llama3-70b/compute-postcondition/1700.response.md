The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the initial state: `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. Since both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition that they are within the bounds of 0 and less than `N`, the assignment of `ncur` will be valid. 

The states of the other variables, such as `N`, `y`, `x`, `dx`, and `dy`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
