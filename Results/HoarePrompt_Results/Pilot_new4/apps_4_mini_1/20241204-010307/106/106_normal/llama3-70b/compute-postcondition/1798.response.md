The variable `queue` is updated by appending a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `1`. The preconditions and other variable states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 3, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
