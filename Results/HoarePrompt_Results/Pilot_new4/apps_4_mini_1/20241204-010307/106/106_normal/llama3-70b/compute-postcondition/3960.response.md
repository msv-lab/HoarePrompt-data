The line of code assigns a value to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` holds the value `A[-2][1]`, and `cur` is used to assign a value to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. The current state of other variables is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`.**
