The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` indicates that the value at `dist[1][ncur]` is being updated to be one more than the value at `dist[1][cur]`. The existing state outlines that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which implies that the update to `dist[1][ncur]` will reduce this condition.

The output state retains all previous conditions except for the updated value of `dist[1][ncur]`, which will now equal `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
