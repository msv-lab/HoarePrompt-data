The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` (which is equal to `A[x][y]`) to `parent[1][ncur]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged as they are not impacted by this assignment. 

Thus, the output state remains as follows: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `0`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `0`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
