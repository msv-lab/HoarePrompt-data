Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -2, if both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[0][-2]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
