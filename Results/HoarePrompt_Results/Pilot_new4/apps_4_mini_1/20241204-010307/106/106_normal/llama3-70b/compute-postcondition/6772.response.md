Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `parent[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `queue` is updated during the loop execution, `0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
