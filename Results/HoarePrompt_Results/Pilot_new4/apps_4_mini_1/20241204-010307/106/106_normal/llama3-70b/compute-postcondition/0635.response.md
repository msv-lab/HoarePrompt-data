The value `ncur` has already been assigned the value `A[x - 2][2]`, and the queue now has a new tuple appended to it. The variables `N`, `y`, `x`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged in terms of their previous conditions. The tuple `(ncur, 0)` is added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 2][2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
