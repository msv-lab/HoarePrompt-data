The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the constant `1` are unchanged, and the state of the `queue` is updated. Thus, we need to specify that the `queue` now contains an additional element while retaining all previous elements.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0), (ncur, 1), and (ncur, 1) has been appended, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `cur`, and `piece` is assigned to `parent[1][ncur]`.**
