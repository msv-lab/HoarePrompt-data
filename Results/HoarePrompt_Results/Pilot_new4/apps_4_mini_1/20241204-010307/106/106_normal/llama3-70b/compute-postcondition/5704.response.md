According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional changes `(dx, dy)`. Each iteration of the loop applies a different `(dx, dy)` to the variables `nx` and `ny`. Given that `dx` and `dy` take specific values in each iteration, we should consider the first iteration of the loop, which uses the first tuple `(-2, -1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, and `nx` is equal to `dx` (which will be -2 in the first iteration) and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy` (which will be `2 + (-1)` = 1). 

To continue the loop, it will take the next tuple in the list in the following iteration. Therefore, the next `(dx, dy)` will be `(-2, 1)` for the second iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to update the states regarding the next `(dx, dy)` values. The values `nx` and `ny` will change accordingly based on the new `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `-2`, `ny` is equal to `3` (considering the second tuple (-2, 1)).**
