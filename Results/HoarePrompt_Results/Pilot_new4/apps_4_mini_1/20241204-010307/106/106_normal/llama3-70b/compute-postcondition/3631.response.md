The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the calculations `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variables `x` and `y` remain within the range of 0 to `N-1`, and since at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid, it implies that `nx` and/or `ny` are still in the valid range. Thus, the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid.**
