The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are added as a new item in the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows: 
`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` paired with `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` paired with `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
