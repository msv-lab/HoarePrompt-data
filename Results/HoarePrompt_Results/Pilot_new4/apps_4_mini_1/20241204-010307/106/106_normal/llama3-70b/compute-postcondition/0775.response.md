The operation `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
