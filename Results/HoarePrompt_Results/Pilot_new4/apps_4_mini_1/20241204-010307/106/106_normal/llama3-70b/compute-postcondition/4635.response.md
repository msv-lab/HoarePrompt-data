Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on all valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for all valid moves, `queue` contains all potential next states based on valid moves from the initial position, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `dist[2][cur] + 1` for all valid `(nx, ny)` pairs where `piece` equals 2, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned `(cur, piece)` for those valid pairs. If no valid moves were possible, then `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
