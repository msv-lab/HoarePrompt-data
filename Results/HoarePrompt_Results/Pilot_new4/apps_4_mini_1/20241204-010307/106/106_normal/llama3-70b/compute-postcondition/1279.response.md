The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the distance at position `ncur` for the second row of the `dist` array. The exact values of `dist[1][cur]` and `ncur` are not provided, but we know they are involved in the calculation. 

Since `cur` is unchanged, we can infer that the distance at the position indexed by `ncur` will be assigned a value that is one greater than the distance at the position indexed by `cur`. 

Given that `ncur` is initially `A[0][3]`, we must note that `dist[1][ncur]` now reflects this updated distance. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1.**
