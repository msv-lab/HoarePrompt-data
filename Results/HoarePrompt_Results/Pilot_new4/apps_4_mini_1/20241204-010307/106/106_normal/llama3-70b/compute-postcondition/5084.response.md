The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variable `x` has a value of 3, while `y` has a value of 1. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unknown. The other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `piece`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` contains its previous valid tuples plus the new tuple (cur, 1), current value of `piece` is not equal to 1.**
