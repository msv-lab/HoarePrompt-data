The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The previous values of `x` and `y` are both 2, while `dx` and `dy` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Therefore, the calculations yield:

- `nx` becomes `2 + dx`
- `ny` becomes `2 + dy`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is the updated distance, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur and piece`, `queue` includes the next tuple `(ncur, 0)` for the next pair of `(dx, dy)`**.
