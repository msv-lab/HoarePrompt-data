The code appends the tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The value of `cur` and `i` can be any integer within the context of the loop. This operation will not change the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `piece`. Therefore, the output state retains all the previous information while reflecting the change in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` now contains all the tuples of positions that were valid and explored during the loop execution plus the tuple `(cur, i)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(x, y)` considering all valid knight's moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, and `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
