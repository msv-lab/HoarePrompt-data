The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx`, and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The initial state indicates that `x` is 2 and `y` is 0. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not given, but they will determine the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Thus, the output state should reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while preserving the existing valid states of other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances updated based on valid moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding previous positions for reachable states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid (nx, ny) coordinates.**
