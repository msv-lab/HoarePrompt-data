The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, and `dy` is 0, we calculate `nx` and `ny` as follows:

- `nx = x + dx = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + 0 = 0`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` set to `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` set to `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
