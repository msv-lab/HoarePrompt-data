Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist` contains the shortest path distances from the starting position for all valid reachable `ncur` values based on the piece type conditions; `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for those reachable `ncur`; `queue` includes all reachable tuples derived from the iterations. If there are no valid moves during the entire loop execution, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
