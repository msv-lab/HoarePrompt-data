To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state. 

Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3.

The code snippet is:
```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```

Here, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values used to index into the array `A` are `nx` and `ny`. Based on the initial state, `nx` is 2 and `ny` is 3. 

The output state should reflect that `ncur` has been assigned a value, but does not change the other variables. The specific value of `A[nx][ny]` is not provided in the initial state, so it will remain as `A[2][3]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][3]`.**
