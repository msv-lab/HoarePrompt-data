In the code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x` and `y`, and the values of `dx` and `dy`. Since `dx` takes values from the list `[( -1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, we assume that in each iteration of the process, one of these pairs is selected for `dx` and `dy`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is between 4 and 10.
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 2.
- `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are set but not modified by this code snippet.

Calculating `nx` and `ny` for each possible value of `dx` and `dy`:
1. For `dx = -1, dy = 0`: 
   - `nx = 4 + (-1) = 3`
   - `ny = 2 + 0 = 2`
2. For `dx = 1, dy = 0`: 
   - `nx = 4 + 1 = 5`
   - `ny = 2 + 0 = 2`
3. For `dx = 0, dy = -1`: 
   - `nx = 4 + 0 = 4`
   - `ny = 2 + (-1) = 1`
4. For `dx = 0, dy = 1`: 
   - `nx = 4 + 0 = 4`
   - `ny = 2 + 1 = 3`

Since `nx` and `ny` can take on multiple values based on the selections of `dx` and `dy`, we can summarize the output state while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` can be 3, 5, or 4, and `ny` can be 1, 2, or 3 depending on the selected `dx` and `dy`.**
