In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. 

The previous values are:
- `x` is 0
- `dx` is -1
- `y` is 1
- `dy` is 1

Calculating `nx` and `ny`:
- `nx = x + dx` translates to `nx = 0 + (-1)`, which results in `nx = -1`.
- `ny = y + dy` translates to `ny = 1 + 1`, which results in `ny = 2`.

Thus, the results of the assignments are:
- `nx` is now `-1`
- `ny` is now `2`

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect these updates.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`**.
