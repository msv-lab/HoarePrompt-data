Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N-1], the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, with `parent[0][ncur]` set to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
