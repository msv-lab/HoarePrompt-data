The code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]` and associates it with `piece`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are defined by the context in which this code runs, but they depend on the state of the program before this line is executed. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` as well as `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`**.
