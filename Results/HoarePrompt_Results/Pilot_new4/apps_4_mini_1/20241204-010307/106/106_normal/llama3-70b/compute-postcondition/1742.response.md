According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible directional moves defined by the tuples in the list `[(dx, dy)]`. The loop will execute four times, once for each direction. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`
- `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is 2
- The condition involving `dist` is either satisfied or not, depending on whether the updates were made during the execution of the loop body.

After the last iteration of the loop, the program is set to check the next direction in the list. The loop index is not explicitly defined, but since we know there are four iterations for the four directional movements, we can conclude that for the next execution when the loop runs again, it will pick the next tuple from the list.

Since there are four tuples in the list, we can determine that after the last iteration, the loop would have executed the directional movement for all four possibilities.

State: **`nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and there is no change made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` in the last iteration (if applicable).**
