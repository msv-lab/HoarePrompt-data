The line of code updates the `dist` array at index `[2][ncur]`. The value assigned to `dist[2][ncur]` is calculated as `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Here, `ncur` is determined by the value of `A[nx][ny]`. 

Since `N` is at least 4, `dist` and `parent` are already defined for reachable indices, and `piece` remains unchanged at 2. The previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated, but we do not have information about the initial values of `dist[2][cur]` and `ncur`. However, we know that the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` will be one greater than `dist[2][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is still 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
