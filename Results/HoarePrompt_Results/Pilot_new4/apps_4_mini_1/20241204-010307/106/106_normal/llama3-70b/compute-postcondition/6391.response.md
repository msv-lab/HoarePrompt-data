Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(cur, i)`, where `cur` is the current position, and `i` is the piece value. If `piece` is equal to `i`, the state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remains unchanged.***
