Postcondition: ***`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the element `(ncur, 2)` appended to it. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes occur.***
