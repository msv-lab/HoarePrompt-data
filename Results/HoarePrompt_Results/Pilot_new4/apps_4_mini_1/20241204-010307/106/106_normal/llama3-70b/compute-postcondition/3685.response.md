Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` contains minimum distances, `parent` contains respective parents, `queue` contains reachable positions and piece types based on movement rules, the value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `x + dx` and `y + dy` are within valid bounds of A. `nx` is within the range `0 <= nx < N` and `ny` is within the range `0 <= ny < N`.**
