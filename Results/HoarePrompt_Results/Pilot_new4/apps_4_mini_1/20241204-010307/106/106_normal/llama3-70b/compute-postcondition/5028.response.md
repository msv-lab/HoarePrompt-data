Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` is reflective of reachable positions, `parent` corresponds to those reachable positions, `queue` contains valid tuples based on knight's moves from (x, y), `nx` is 3 + dx, `ny` is 0 + dy, `ncur` is A[nx][ny]. The variable `piece` equals 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
