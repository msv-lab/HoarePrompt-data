The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, and it is given that these values satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. Therefore, we can conclude that `ncur` will take a value from the array `A` based on valid indices within its dimensions.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, and `A[nx][ny]` is valid, we do not have specific values for `A`, `dx`, or `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
