The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]` along with `piece`, but since `cur` is unknown, we cannot assign a specific value to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[1][ncur]` remain unchanged. The only change occurs in `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
