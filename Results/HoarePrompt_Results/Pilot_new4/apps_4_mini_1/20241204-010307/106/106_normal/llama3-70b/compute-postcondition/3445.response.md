Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is undefined due to out-of-bounds indexing. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the assignment to `dist[0][ncur]` cannot be performed, and `parent[0][ncur]` assignment cannot be performed due to `ncur` being undefined; hence, `queue` now contains `(undefined, 0)`.***
