In this scenario, the code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `parent` are not directly modified by this line of code. However, we acknowledge the state of the `queue` is altered.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `piece` is 1; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is 2 + `dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
