According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` in relation to `N`. The loop will execute for each value of `y` from 0 to `N-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, and `N` is between 3 and 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1, which makes `y` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be at least 3, and specifically for this iteration, it can be any value greater than or equal to 3, allowing `y` to take the value of 2.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), and `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop plus the new tuple `(cur, 2)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
