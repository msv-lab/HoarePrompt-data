The assignment `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current distance stored in `dist[0][cur]`. The previous condition states that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which implies that the distance to the current node plus one is shorter than the previously recorded distance to `ncur`. Therefore, after execution, `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, indicating that a shorter path to `ncur` has been found through `cur`.

Other variables remain unaffected, so the output state needs to reflect the updated value of `dist[0][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, `queue` are in a valid state, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
