The code appends a new tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This modifies the `queue` variable by adding the new tuple, but does not affect the other variables directly. The previously defined values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` now contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1) and also the new tuple (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, 2)`**
