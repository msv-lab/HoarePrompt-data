The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated using the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Given that `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, and `dy` is 1, we can calculate the new values:

- `nx` becomes `2 + 0`, which is `2`.
- `ny` becomes `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 2.**
