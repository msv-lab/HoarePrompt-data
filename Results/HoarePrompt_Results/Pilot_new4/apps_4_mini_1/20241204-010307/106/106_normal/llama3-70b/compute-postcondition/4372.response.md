Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][N]`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to the `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
