The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The other variables are unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include all the previous information and the new state of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and N-2, `dx` and `dy` are processed, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` has appended `(ncur, 0)`**.
