Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` and `dy` will take on all values from their respective lists; `nx` and `ny` will be calculated based on the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `[0, N)` for at least one pair of `dx` and `dy`, then `ncur` will be assigned the corresponding value `A[nx][ny]`. After all iterations, `dist[0][ncur]` will have been updated at least once if the conditions were satisfied, and `parent[0][ncur]` will contain the last valid `cur` value and `piece`. The `queue` will contain tuples of all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs added during the iterations. If no pairs of `dx` and `dy` yield valid indices, `queue` remains unchanged and the original values of `dist` and `parent` persist.**
