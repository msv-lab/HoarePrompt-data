The code assigns values to the `parent` array based on the current values of `ncur` and `cur`. Specifically, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dx`, `dy`, and `dist` remain unchanged, as they are not directly referenced or modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
