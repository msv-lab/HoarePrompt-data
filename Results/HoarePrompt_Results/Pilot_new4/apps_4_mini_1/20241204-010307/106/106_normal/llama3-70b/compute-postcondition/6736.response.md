Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1, `y` is 1; `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1); `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1); `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop; and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
