The values `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the values of `x`, `y`, and the variables `dx` and `dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state or as part of the code snippet. Therefore, we are unable to determine the exact new values of `nx` and `ny` without knowing `dx` and `dy`. Since `x` is 3 and `y` is 1, the only information we can provide is that `nx` will be `3 + dx` and `ny` will be `1 + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is 0, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`.**
