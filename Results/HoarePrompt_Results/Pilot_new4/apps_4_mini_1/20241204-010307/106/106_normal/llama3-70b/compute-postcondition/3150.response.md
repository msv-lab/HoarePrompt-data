The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. Given that `piece` is not equal to `i` and that we are not updating any other variables, the only change is that a new pair is appended to `queue`. The existing variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` remains 1 if no valid `(nx, ny)` pairs are found; if valid pairs are found, `piece` is updated to 2 for those pairs. `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distance values based on updates made during the iterations, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the last valid `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur` updated, `queue` contains the original valid `(ncur, 2)` pairs plus the new pair `(cur, i)` added during the iterations.**
