The assignment `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`, replacing its previous value with the result of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given the conditions that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it implies that the previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` was at least one more than `dist[1][cur]`. The value of `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged.

The variables that are valid after the code execution are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is `2 + dx`
- `ny` is `1 + dy`
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` equals 1
- The new value of `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
