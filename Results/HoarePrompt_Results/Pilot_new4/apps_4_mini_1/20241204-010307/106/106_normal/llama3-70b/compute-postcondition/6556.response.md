The line of code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` at the index specified by `ncur`, along with the value of `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not altered by this operation, and the values of other variables remain unchanged as well. The previous values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are preserved in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is unchanged.**
