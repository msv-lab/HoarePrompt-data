Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`, and the iteration count remains 4, indicating that it cannot execute again without changes.***
