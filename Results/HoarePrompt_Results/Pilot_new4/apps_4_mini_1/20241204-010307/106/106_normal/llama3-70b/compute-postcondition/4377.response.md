Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist` has been updated for valid `ncur` positions where `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent` has been updated for those positions, and `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 2)` for all valid positions processed during the loop execution. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, `queue` also includes the tuple `(cur, i)` where the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` retain their prior values.***
