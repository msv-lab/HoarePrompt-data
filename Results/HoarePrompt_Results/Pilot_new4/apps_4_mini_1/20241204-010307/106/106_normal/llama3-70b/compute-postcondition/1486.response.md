Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dist[2]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell for piece 2; `parent[2]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell for piece 2; `queue` contains tuples of reachable cells processed based on valid moves. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
