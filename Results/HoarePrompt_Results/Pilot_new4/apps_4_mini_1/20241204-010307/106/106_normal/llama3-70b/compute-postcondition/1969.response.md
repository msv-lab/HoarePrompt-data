In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, but the variables `x` and `y` will be updated based on their current values and the changes brought by `dx` and `dy`. The initial state mentions that `N` is at least 4, but that does not affect the calculation of `nx` and `ny`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes to `nx` and `ny`, while keeping the initial state for `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` is unchanged, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`**
