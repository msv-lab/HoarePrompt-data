The code snippet calculates the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the increments provided by `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are given as `-1` and `1`, respectively. Therefore, `nx` is assigned the value of `x - 1` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + 1`. The initial values of `N`, `A[x][y]`, and the ranges for `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`.**
