`ncur` is assigned the value of the element from the 2D array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state combines the definition of `ncur` with the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`.**
