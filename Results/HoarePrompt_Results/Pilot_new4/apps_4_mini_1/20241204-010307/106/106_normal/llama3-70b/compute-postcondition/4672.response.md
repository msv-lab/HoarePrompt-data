The line of code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned to be one more than the value of `dist[1][cur]`. Given that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, we conclude that `dist[1][cur]` must have a value less than `dist[1][ncur] - 1`. Therefore, the relationship holds true, and the previous values remain unchanged apart from `dist[1][ncur]`.

The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and the relationship defining `dist` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the current value of `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
