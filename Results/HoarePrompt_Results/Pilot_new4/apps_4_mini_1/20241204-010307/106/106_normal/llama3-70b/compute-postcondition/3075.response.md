The code appends a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `0` to the list `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state provides that `ncur` was previously assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + 2`, and `ny` is currently `3`. The updated output state will reflect the addition of the tuple to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, the current value of `nx` is between 0 and `N`, the current value of `ny` is between 0 and `N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
