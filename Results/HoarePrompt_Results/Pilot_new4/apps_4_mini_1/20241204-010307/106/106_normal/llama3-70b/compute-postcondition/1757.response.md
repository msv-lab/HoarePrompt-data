In the given code, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. However, the initial state does not define `x` specifically, so we will leave it in terms of its relation to the other variables. 

- `N` is between 3 and 10 (but not directly affected by the code).
- `y` is 2, and `dy` is 1, which means `ny` will be calculated as `2 + 1`, resulting in `ny = 3`.
- `dx` is 2, which will be added to `x` for calculating `nx`.

The impact on the variables is:
- `ny` becomes 3.
- `nx` is `x + 2`, where `x` remains unspecified.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, and `ny` is 3.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is 3.**
