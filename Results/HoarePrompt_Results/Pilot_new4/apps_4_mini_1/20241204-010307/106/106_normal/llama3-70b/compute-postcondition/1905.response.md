The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous condition that `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` implies that `ncur` is a reachable index that has been updated based on the current state represented by `cur`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
