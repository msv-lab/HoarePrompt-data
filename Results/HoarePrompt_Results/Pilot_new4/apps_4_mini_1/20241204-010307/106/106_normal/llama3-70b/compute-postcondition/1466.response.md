The code assigns `cur` and `piece` as the values to `parent[2][ncur]`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the `parent` array's specific index `[2][ncur]`, which is updated with the values of `cur` and `piece`. 

Since `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state given, we will simply denote them as their respective values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
