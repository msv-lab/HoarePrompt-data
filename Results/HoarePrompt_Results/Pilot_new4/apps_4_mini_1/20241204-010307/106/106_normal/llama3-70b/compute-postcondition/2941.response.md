According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction offsets `[( -1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, which contains 4 elements. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take on each of these pairs in succession. Since the loop has already executed once in the previous iteration, we need to determine the state for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` was potentially updated if the conditions were satisfied. The loop iterates through the 4 elements, so after the first iteration, `dx` and `dy` would be set to the first element `(-1, -1)`, then `(-1, 1)`, followed by `(1, -1)`, and finally `(1, 1)`.

Since we are at the end of an iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, we will set `dx` and `dy` to the next tuple in the list of offsets. Assuming that we have completed the first iteration with `dx` and `dy` being `(-1, -1)`, they will now be set to `(-1, 1)` for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
