According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the iterable provided in the loop, which is a fixed list of tuples representing coordinate changes. Since the list contains 8 tuples, the loop will always execute 8 times regardless of the values of `N` and `y`. However, `y` is equal to `N`, which does not affect loop execution directly but provides context for the program's logic.

As the loop will execute, the state of `dx` and `dy` needs to be initialized to the first tuple in the list during the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we should set `dx` and `dy` to the first values of the tuple in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
