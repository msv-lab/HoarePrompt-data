Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1` if it was greater, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
