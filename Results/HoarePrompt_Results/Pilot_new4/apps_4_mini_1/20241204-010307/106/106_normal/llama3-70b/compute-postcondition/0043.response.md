Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `cur` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` holds corresponding values, `queue` contains reachable `ncur` values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
