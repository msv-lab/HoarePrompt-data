To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: 
- `N` is between 4 and 10
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 1
- `piece` is 2
- `nx` is 4
- `ny` is 2

Code Snippet:
```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

In the code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are being assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Without knowing the specific values of `dx` and `dy`, we cannot compute the new values of `nx` and `ny`. 

Since `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on `x + dx` and `y + dy`, the output state will reflect that `nx` and `ny` will now depend on those unknown values.

Therefore, the output state will retain the values of the variables that remain unchanged and will note that `nx` and `ny` are now dependent on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`**
