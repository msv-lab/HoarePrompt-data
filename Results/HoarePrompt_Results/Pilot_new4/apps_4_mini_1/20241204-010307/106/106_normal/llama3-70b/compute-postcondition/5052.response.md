The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes the sum of `x` and `dx`, and `ny` becomes the sum of `y` and `dy`. The states of the other variables (`dist`, `parent`, `queue`) are not affected, so we retain their descriptions in the output state.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions, `queue` must contain at least one valid tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
