The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Since `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` specifically depends on the values of `A` at those indices. The output state will include the current values of `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `dist` remains unchanged, `parent` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
