The operation `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are unchanged, but the `queue` will now include this new value. 

Therefore, the Output State reflects that the initial conditions remain valid, and it indicates that the `queue` has been updated with the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` now contains valid positions along with the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
