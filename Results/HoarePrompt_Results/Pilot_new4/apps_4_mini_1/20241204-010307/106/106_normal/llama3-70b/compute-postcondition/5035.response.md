The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values calculated from `x` and `y` using `dx` and `dy`. Given that `x` is 3 and both `dx` and `dy` are -1, we can calculate the new values:

- `nx = x + dx` = `3 + (-1)` = `2`
- `ny = y + dy` = `0 + (-1)` = `-1`

Since `ny` is calculated as `-1`, this means that the constraint `0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, which indicates that `ny` is out of bounds. However, the code does not change any constraints or boolean values regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, or `dy`.

Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, while updating `nx` and `ny`:

Output State: **If `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 2, and `ny` is -1.**
