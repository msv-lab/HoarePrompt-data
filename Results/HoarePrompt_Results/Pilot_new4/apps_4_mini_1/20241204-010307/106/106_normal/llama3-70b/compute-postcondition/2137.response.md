Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` initialized for valid `ncur`, `piece` is currently 1, `queue` contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where nx and ny are within bounds. The current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
