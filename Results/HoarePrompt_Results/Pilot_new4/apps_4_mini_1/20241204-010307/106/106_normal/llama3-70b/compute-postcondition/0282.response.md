Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, if `nx` is between 0 and `N - 1` and `ny` is between 0 and `N - 1`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
