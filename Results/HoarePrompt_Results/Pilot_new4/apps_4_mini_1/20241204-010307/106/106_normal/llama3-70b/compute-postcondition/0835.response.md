According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`, which contains 4 elements. The loop variable `(dx, dy)` will take on each of these tuples in turn during the iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop must have processed one of the tuples, meaning `(dx, dy)` must be assigned to one of the tuples. Given that `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `N` is between 3 and 10 (ensuring valid indices), we can conclude that the loop can execute one more time if it hasn't yet gone through all 4 tuples.

Since each iteration processes one tuple from this list, after the last iteration, `(dx, dy)` must have been assigned the last tuple, which is `(1, 1)`. Therefore, for the next iteration, it will increment through the tuples.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; for the loop to execute one more time, `(dx, dy)` must be the first tuple `(-1, -1)`, second tuple `(-1, 1)`, or third tuple `(1, -1)` as the last processed tuple was `(1, 1)`**.
