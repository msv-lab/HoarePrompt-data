The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, the value of `ncur` is determined based on the values of `A` at indices `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][dy]`.**
