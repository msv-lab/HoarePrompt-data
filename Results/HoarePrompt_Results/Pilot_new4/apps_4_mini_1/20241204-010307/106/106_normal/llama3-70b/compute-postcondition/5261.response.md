The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are previously defined as `4 + dx` and `0 + dy`, respectively, and both are stated to be within the valid range based on `N`. The other variables retain their previous states as they are unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
