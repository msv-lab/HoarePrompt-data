The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the involved variables are:

- `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.
- `piece` is equal to 2.
- `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for each valid knight move.

Since `queue` is modified by appending a new tuple, the output state will reflect this change while maintaining the previous state of all other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[1]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions, `parent[1][ncur]` contains associated parent positions, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` retains updated parent positions, `queue` now contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to existing tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`**.
