According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples which represent the possible changes in `dx` and `dy`. Since the loop processes each tuple in the list, the state that needs to be modified includes `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` correspond to the first tuple, which is `(-2, -1)` for the final iteration. The loop processes each tuple sequentially. Therefore, after processing `(-2, -1)`, the next tuple `(-2, 1)` will be processed in the loop.

Thus, the state adjustments necessary for the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `dx` and `dy` are now set to `(-2, 1)`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][1 + dy]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no action is performed.**
