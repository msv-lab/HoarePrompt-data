Postcondition: ***Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, and `ny` is 1 + `dy`, if `nx` and `ny` are within the grid boundaries (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, otherwise `queue` remains empty, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, with `parent[1][ncur]` assigned the value of `cur` if `piece` is 1. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
