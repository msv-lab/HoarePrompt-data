The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, but `parent[1][ncur]` is modified with these values. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
