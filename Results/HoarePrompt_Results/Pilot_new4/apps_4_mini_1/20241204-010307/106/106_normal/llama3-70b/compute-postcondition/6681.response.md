Output State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is `1`, `y` is `1`, `dist` contains the updated distances for valid positions reachable from `(1, 1)`, `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from `(1, 1)`, and `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from `(1, 1)` that were updated during the loop. If `piece` was equal to `0` and any of the valid moves updated the distances, `dist[0][ncur]` will reflect those updates, `parent[0][ncur]` will show the corresponding predecessors, and `queue` will hold the tuples of newly reachable positions. If no valid moves updated the values, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized values.**
