In the given code snippet, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The variable `cur` must have a specific value defined previously in the program, but it is not provided in the initial state. However, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is an element from the 2D array `A` at the index `[nx][ny]`. The other variables retain their values. 

The updated state includes the new assignment to `parent[2][ncur]`, but the values of `cur` and `ncur` remain undefined in terms of their specific values since the initial state does not specify them. The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and the update to `dist[2][ncur]` will still hold true.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
