Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`. If `nx` and `ny` are within the range from 0 to N-1, when `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`. Otherwise, the values prior to execution remain unchanged.***
