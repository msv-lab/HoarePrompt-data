According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over the possible directions defined in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Each iteration of the loop will assign a tuple of direction deltas to `dx` and `dy`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `N` is between 3 and 10, and the conditions for updating `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are based on the variables `nx` and `ny`, derived from `cur` and the current `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute again for the next set of `dx` and `dy` values.

Since `dx` and `dy` are updated in each iteration and the loop will iterate through all four tuples, after the final iteration, the next iteration will set `dx` and `dy` to the first tuple again, which starts the loop. However, since we are interested in what the states will look like at the start of the next iteration:

- After the last execution, there are no changes to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` if the conditions weren't met.
- We are now ready to start the loop again with the next set from the list.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we simply need to account for the next direction tuple, which could lead to another check in the conditions but does not influence the state beyond looping through the existing tuples. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -1 (first iteration of the next loop)**
