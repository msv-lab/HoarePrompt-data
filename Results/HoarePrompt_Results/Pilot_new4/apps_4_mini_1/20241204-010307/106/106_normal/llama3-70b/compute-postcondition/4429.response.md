The action `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are used directly from the previous states without any additional computations. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now contains a tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
