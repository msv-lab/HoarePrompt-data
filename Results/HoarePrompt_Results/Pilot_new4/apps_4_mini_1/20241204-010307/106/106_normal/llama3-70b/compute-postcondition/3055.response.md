In the provided code, the variables `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

- `nx` is updated to `x + dx`
- `ny` is updated to `y + dy`

However, the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine their numeric values. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `x + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `y + dy`. 

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
