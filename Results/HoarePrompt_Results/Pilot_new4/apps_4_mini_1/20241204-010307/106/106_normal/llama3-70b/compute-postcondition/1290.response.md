`dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The initial state indicates that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which implies that the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` was at least `dist[2][cur] + 2` or greater. After the assignment, the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` becomes exactly `dist[2][cur] + 1`, thus violating the previous condition that it was greater than this value.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which is no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which is no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
