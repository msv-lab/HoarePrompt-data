Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is defined, `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move, and `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `queue` now contains an additional position `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
