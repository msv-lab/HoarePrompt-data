The instruction `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the value of `parent[0][ncur]` is being updated with two values: `cur` and `piece`. However, since this assignment appears to be a tuple (which Python allows), it implies that `parent[0][ncur]` is being assigned the first value (`cur`), and the second value (`piece`) does not affect any variable in this context.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is at least 4
- `piece` remains determined by the loop conditions (its specific value is not known)
- `y` is still 0
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`

The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to equal `cur`, and thus the only change in the output state will reflect this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains determined by the loop conditions, `y` is still 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
