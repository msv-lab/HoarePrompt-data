The variable `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is 0 and `dy` is 1, this means that `nx` will remain equal to `x`, while `ny` will be equal to `y + 1`. The values of `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, `piece`, `cur`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is the current position, `ncur` is the next position being considered, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
