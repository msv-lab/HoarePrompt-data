Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`, then if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `nx` and `ny` are out of bounds, no changes occur.***
