Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` and `dy` have iterated through the pairs defined in the loop, `nx` and `ny` represent the resulting positions based on `x` and `y` after applying the respective `dx` and `dy`. The final values of `dist[0][ncur]` reflect the shortest distance updates from `dist[0][cur]` based on valid moves, while `parent[0][ncur]` contains the corresponding parent pointers. The `queue` contains all reachable states added during the iterations depending on the validity of the positions. If none of the conditions for appending to the queue were met, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
