The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is `2 + dx` and `ny` is `2 + dy`, where both `nx` and `ny` are valid indices between 0 and `N-1`, the current state of `ncur` depends on the values in the array `A` at the specified indices. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist` reflects updated shortest distances for valid moves, `parent` reflects updated parent references for valid moves, `queue` contains at least one valid position, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
