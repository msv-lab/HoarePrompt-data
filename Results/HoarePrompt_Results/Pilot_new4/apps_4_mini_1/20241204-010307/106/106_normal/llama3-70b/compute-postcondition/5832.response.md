The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` is 2 while `ny` is -1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` and possibly also `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is set to 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`.
