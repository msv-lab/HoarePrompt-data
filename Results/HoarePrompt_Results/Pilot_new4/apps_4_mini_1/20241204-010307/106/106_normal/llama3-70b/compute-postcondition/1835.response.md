Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 2; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` holds true, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated accordingly, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made.***
