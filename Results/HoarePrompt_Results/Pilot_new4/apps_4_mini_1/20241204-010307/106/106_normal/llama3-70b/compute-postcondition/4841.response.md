The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned as follows: `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is the original x position, and `y` is the original y position + 1. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but they are assumed to be the next values from some list.

The states of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, while the values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the changes from `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated values of `nx` and `ny` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
