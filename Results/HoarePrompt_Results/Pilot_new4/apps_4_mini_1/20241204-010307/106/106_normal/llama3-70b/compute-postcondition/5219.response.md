The `queue.append((ncur, 1))` statement adds a tuple containing `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added to the `queue`, but no other variables are affected or changed by this code. 

The variables remain as they were, with `ncur` being equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, and the initial conditions regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, and other variables still hold true.

Thus, the output state reflects the ongoing conditions and the new addition to the queue.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
