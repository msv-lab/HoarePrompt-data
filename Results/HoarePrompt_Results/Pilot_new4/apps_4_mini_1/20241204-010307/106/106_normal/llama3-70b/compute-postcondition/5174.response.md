The code assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`, which will be calculated using the previous values of `dist[0][cur]` and the constant value `1`. The initial state indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. After executing the code, `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, thus violating the initial condition.

The relevant variables updated are:
- `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (initial condition violated).**
