The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is updated with the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The previous value of `parent[2][ncur]` is not known, but it is now set to the current value of `cur` and the value of `piece`, which is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated based on prior conditions, `queue` is properly populated with positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the value of `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 2)`**.
