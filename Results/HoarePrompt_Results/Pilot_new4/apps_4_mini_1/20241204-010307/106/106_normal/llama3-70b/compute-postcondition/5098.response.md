In the given code snippet, the statement adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `queue` are the main focus here, while other variables remain unchanged.

1. The variable `ncur` was previously assigned the value `A[3 + dx][1 + dy]`.
2. The tuple `(ncur, 0)` will be added to the `queue`, which modifies the `queue` variable to include this new element.

The other variables, including `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `parent`, are not directly affected by this statement, and their values remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `ncur` is A[3 + dx][1 + dy], `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated with (cur, piece), `queue` now contains the new element `(ncur, 0)`**.
