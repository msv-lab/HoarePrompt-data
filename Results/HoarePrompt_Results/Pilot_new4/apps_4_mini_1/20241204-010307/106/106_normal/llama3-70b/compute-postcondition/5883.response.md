The line of code `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the indices `[0][ncur]`. This means the value of `parent[0][ncur]` is now a tuple containing `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The initial state indicates that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive)
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `piece` is equal to 0
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`

Since `piece` is equal to 0, the assignment will set `parent[0][ncur]` to be a tuple of `cur` and 0. The value of `cur` is not specified but will be preserved in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]; parent[0][ncur]` is equal to the tuple `(cur, 0)`**.
