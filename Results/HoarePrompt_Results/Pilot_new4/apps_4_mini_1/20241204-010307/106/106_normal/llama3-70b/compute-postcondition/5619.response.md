The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The initial values of `x` and `y` are 0 and 1. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `0 + dx`, and `ny` will be equal to `1 + dy`. The values of `N`, `queue`, `dx`, and `dy` are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
