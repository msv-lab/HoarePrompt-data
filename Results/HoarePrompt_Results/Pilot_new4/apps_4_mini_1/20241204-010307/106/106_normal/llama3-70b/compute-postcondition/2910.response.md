The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, along with `piece`. The state of the `parent` variable is updated to include this new relationship. Other variables such as `N`, `y`, `dist`, `queue`, and the variables relating to positions (`nx`, `ny`, `ncur`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
