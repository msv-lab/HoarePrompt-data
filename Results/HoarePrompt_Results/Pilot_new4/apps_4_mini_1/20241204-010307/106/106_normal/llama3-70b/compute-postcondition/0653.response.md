The code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to the `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous state has `parent[0][ncur]` valid, and now it will also include the assignment to `parent[1][ncur]`. The existing conditions regarding the variables remain valid after the execution. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is valid, `parent[0][ncur]` is valid, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` entries, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is equal to 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.**
