The values of `nx` and `ny` are computed as the sum of `x` and `dx`, and `y` and `dy`, respectively. The values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, but we know that `y` is equal to `N`, where `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`. Therefore, `ny` will be equal to `N + dy`, and `nx` will depend on the specific values of `x` and `dx`. 

Given that `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `N + dy`, we can express the new values of `nx` and `ny`. However, without specific values for `x`, `dx`, `dy`, and the current value of `cur`, we cannot determine exact values for `nx` and `ny`. 

The states of other variables (`dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `ncur`, and `piece`) remain unchanged after this line of code, as it only impacts the calculation of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for valid positions; `piece` is equal to 1; current direction being processed is `(-1, 1)`.**
