`nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which equals `4 + (-1)`, resulting in `nx` having the value `3`. `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which equals `0 + 1`, resulting in `ny` having the value `1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 1**
