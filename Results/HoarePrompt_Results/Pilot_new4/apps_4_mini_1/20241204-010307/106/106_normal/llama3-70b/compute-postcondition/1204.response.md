The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Given that the value of `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this assignment will make `dist[2][ncur]` equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

Other variables remain unchanged, but the condition will now not hold true since `dist[2][ncur]` will no longer be greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

The output state will thus reflect the change in `dist[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 0, 1, or 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` based on the current values of `nx` and `ny`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
