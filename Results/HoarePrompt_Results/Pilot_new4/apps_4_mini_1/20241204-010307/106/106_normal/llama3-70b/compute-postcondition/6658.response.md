The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is `1 + dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`, which is between `3` and `10`. Therefore, `ncur` will hold the value of the element in the 2D array `A` at the position defined by `(nx, ny)`.

The other variables `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged in this context. Thus, the output state retains all prior variable information along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) with `(cur, i)` appended to `queue` if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
