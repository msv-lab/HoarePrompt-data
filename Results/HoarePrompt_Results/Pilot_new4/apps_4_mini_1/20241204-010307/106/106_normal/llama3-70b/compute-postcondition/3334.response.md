Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering all valid knight's moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
