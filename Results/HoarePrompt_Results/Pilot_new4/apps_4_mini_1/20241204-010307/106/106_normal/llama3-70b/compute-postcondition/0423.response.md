According to the code, the loop will iterate over the pairs of `(dx, dy)` values. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has completed one full cycle through these pairs.

The loop has 4 elements to iterate over. Since `y` is currently 1 and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, we need to assess the state after the last iteration to determine the next state.

After the last iteration, the loop must have completed the fourth pair of `(dx, dy)`, which is `(0, 1)`. Each time the loop iterates, it cycles through the pairs of directions, so we need to move to the first pair again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` and `dy` would be adjusted to the first pair in the sequence, which is `(-1, 0)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is the current value of `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
