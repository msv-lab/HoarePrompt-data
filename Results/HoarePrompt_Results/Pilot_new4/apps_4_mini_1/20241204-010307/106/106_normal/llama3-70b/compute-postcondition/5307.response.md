To analyze the given code snippet, we need to observe the effect of the assignment statement on the variables and what remains unchanged.

1. The code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the location in the `parent` array indexed by `[1][ncur]`. 
2. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` remain unchanged based on the provided code.
3. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]`, which is not directly affected by this operation, so it retains its previously defined value.

Given this evaluation, we conclude that the output state will include the unchanged variables and the updated value of `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 5, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
