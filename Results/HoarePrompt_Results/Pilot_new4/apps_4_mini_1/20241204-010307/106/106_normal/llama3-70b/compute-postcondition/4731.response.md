According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, the `queue` contains the element `(1, 3)`, which means it is not empty, and thus the loop is set to execute. Therefore, there is no need to modify any states for the loop to proceed for the first iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10, dist contains the shortest distances from the starting position to all reachable positions based on piece types, parent reflects the predecessors for each reachable position and their corresponding piece values, cur is the value of the last processed piece, piece indicates the type of the last processed piece, i is 3, dist[3][1] is 0, queue is deque([(1, 3)])**
