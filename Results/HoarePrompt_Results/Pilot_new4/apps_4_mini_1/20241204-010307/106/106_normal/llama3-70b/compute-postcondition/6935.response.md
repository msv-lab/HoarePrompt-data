The code assigns `nx` the value of `x + dx` and `ny` the value of `y + dy`. The initial state provides that `y` is 1, and `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. The conditions check if `nx` and `ny` remain within the bounds of `N`.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, we can conclude that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` can potentially hold true, depending on the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, we do not have explicit values for these variables, so we cannot determine specific values for `nx` and `ny`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`**.
