The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that the variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` have specific relationships and values. The variable `queue` is assumed to be a list that is being modified by appending the new tuple.

Since the code only modifies the `queue`, the other variables remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that `queue` now contains an additional element, which is the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
