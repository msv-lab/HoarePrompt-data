Initial State: `N` is at least 5, `dx` and `dy` must correspond to the next tuple in the list of movement directions, `i` must be less than 8.

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Now, please think step by step: The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` have been defined as the next tuple in the list of movement directions, which means they will be specific values based on the current context. The values of `x` and `y` are used in the calculations but are not specified in the initial state. The other variables `N` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next tuple in the list of movement directions, `i` is less than 8, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
