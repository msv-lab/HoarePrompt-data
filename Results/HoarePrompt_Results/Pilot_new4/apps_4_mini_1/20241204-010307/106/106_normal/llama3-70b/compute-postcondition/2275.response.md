Postcondition: ***`piece` is either 1 or 2. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2]` contains the shortest path distances from `cur` for `piece` 2, `parent[2]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices with `piece` 2, and `queue` includes `(cur, i)` as an additional element. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.***
