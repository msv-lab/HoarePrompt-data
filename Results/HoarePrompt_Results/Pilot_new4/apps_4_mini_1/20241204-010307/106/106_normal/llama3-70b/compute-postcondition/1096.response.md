According to the code, the for loop iterates over the pairs of `(dx, dy)` defined in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. This means that the loop will execute a fixed number of times, specifically 4 times for the 4 pairs provided.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has gone through one of the pairs and will move to the next pair in the next iteration. Given that `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, the next iteration will involve the next pair of `(dx, dy)`.

The loop starts with the first pair `(-1, -1)`, then goes to `(-1, 1)`, followed by `(1, -1)`, and finally `(1, 1)`. If the loop has just completed the iteration for the pair `(1, -1)`, then the next iteration will use the last pair `(1, 1)`.

Therefore, to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop is now processing the last pair. 

Since the loop has completed 3 iterations, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, the state must be modified to reflect that it is now on the fourth pair, which is `(1, 1)`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged; `(dx, dy)` is (1, 1)**
