The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The variable `ncur` is derived from the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current `x` and `y` values adjusted by `dx[i]` and `dy[i]`. Since `piece` is `0`, the value assigned to `parent[0][ncur]` will be a tuple containing `cur` and `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` arrays are initialized, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains valid moves processed during the loop, the current value of `A[1][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` are set for 8 iterations; `nx` is `1 + dx[i]`, `ny` is `0 + dy[i]` for each iteration `i`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
