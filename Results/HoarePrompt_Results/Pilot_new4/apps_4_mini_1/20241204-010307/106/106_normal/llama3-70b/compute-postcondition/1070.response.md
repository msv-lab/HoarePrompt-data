The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Thus, we cannot compute the new values of `nx` and `ny` directly. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged in terms of their relationships, but `nx` and `ny` will depend on `dx` and `dy`, which are unknown.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is now `1 + dx`, `ny` is now `0 + dy`**.
