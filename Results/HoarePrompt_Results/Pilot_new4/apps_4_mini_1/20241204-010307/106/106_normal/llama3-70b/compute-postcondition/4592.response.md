The statement `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to the variables `nx` and `ny`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the previously defined variables `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, based on the initial state, the specific values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are unknown.

- `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`.
- `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. 

Given that `y` is 1, `ny` will be `1 + dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` thus depend on the unknown values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Since the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are undefined in the initial state, we cannot determine specific numeric outcomes for `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output state only updates the values of the affected variables without specific numerical results.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes `ncur` along with previous elements; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
