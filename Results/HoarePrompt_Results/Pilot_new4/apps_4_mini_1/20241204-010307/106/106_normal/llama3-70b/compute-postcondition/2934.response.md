The operation `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, adjusted by `dx` and `dy` respectively. The initial state provides that `nx` is equal to `x + (-1)` and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. Therefore, we can express the changes as follows:

- `nx` is assigned the value of `x - 1` (because `dx` is `-1`).
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + 1`.

The values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
