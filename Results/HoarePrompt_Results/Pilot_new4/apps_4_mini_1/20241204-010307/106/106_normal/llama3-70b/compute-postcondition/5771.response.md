The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are extracted from the previous state information. Since `ncur` was derived from the expression `A[nx][ny]` and other variables have not been altered by this operation, the output state should reflect the unchanged states of the other variables while including the new element added to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
