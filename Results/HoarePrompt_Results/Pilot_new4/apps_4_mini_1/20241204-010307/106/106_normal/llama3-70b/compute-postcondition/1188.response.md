Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1 + `dx`; `ny` is 1 + `dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
