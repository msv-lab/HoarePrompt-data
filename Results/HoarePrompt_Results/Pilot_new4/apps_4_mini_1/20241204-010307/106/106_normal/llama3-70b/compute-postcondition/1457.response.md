Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[1][0]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)` and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
