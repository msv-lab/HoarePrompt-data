The code `queue.append((cur, i))` appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values. The initial conditions about `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and the conditions related to `piece` and updating those variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the `queue` now contains the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dist[2]` is unchanged, `parent[2]` is unchanged, `queue` now contains the tuple `(cur, i)`**.
