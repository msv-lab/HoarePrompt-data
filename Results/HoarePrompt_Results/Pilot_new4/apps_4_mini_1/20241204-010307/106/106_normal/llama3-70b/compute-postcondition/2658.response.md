The `queue` variable is modified by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `0`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are now added to the `queue`. The other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-3]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
