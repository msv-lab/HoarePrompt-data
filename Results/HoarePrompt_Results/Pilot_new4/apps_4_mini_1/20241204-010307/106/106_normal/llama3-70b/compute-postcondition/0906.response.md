The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and also assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. However, since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, `parent[0][ncur]` will effectively be assigned an undefined value, but it will hold the same reference for `piece`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the value of `cur`, which is undefined.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
