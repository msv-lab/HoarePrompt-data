The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` variable now contains an additional entry where the first element is `ncur`, which was derived from `A[nx][-2]` and the second element is the integer `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is `A[nx][-2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now contains an additional element `(ncur, 1)`**.
