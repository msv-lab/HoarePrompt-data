According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `y` and the upper limit `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, and `N` is between 3 and 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the next iteration, `y` will be 2, and for the loop to continue executing, `N` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(x, y)` considering all valid knight's moves, and `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves.**
