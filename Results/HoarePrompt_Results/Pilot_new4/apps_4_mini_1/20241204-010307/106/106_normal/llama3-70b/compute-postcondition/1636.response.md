Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
