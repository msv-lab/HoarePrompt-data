The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified, but the other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. The impact of this code is that the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]` now holds the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
