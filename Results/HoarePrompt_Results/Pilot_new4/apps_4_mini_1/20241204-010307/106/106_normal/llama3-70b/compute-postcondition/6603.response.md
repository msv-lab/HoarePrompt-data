The `queue` variable is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. The previous states of the variables remain unchanged except for `queue`, which now contains the new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, `queue` contains reachable positions and now also includes (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to 1 + `dx`, `ny` is equal to 0 + `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece)**.
