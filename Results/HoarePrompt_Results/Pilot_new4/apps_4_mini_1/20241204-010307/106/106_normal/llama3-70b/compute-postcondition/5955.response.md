According to the code, the for loop will iterate over a list of tuples that contain the pairs `(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)`. The loop does not depend on the values of `N` or `y` for its execution since the iteration is defined statically by the list of tuples. 

Thus, the current state does not require any adjustments for the loop to execute. The loop will run exactly 8 times, once for each tuple in the list, regardless of the values of `N` and `y`. 

State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the current first element of the tuple, `dy` is the current second element of the tuple**
