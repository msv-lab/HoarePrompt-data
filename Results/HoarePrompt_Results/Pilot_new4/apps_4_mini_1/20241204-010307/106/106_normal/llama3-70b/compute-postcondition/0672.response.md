Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 0`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[x - 1][0]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
