The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `piece` are already defined in the initial state. The `queue` is modified by adding a new tuple containing `ncur` (which is equal to `A[nx][ny]`) and the value `2`. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
