Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` and `N`, then if `piece` is equal to `0` and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition for the if statement is not met, no operations are performed.***
