The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` will now contain an additional element, which is `(ncur, 2)`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` do not change, and the other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` now contains all reachable positions from (1, 1) plus the new position `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned `(cur, 2)`**.
