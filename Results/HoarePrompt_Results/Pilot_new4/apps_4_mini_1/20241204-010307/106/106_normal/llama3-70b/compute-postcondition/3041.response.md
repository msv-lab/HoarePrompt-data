The code updates `dist[2][ncur]` with the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this means the condition allows for the assignment to take place. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

The variables affected by the code are:
- `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Since no values for `dist[2][cur]` or `dist[2][ncur]` are provided, we denote `dist[2][cur]` as a specific value, and thus the output reflects that:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1]` reflects predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all processed tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
