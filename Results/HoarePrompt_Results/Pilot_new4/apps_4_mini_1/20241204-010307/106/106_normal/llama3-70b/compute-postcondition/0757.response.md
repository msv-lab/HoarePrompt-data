Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the `queue` has a new element `(ncur, 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
