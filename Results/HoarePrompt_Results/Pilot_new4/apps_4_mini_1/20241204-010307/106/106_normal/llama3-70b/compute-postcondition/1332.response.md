The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is 1 and `ny` is -2, we need to refer to the value at this specific index in the array `A`. The variable `ncur` will now reflect this new value. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent[0][ncur]`, `queue`, `A[2][0]`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains all reachable tuples and includes `(ncur, 0)`, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-2]`.**
