Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9 and `y` is 9. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position. `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distance from the starting point to `ncur` using piece equal to 2. `parent[1][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` contain the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`. Additionally, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the new appended tuple `(cur, i)`. If `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur`, there is no change to the program state.***
