To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we need to analyze the statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 1
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is -2
- `ny` is 2
- `ncur` is `A[-2][2]` (value depends on structure of A)

We have an operation that involves indexing into an array `dist`. The value at `dist[0][cur]` is being incremented by 1 and stored in `dist[0][ncur]`.

1. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][2]`, which means the value of `ncur` is dependent on the array `A`. However, the specific value of `ncur` is not provided in the initial state. 
2. The execution of the line modifies the array `dist`, specifically setting `dist[0][ncur]` to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Since we donâ€™t know the specific values of `dist[0][cur]` and `dist[0][ncur]`, we cannot state their exact values after the execution. However, we can specify that `dist[0][ncur]` is now one more than whatever `dist[0][cur]` was.

No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is `A[-2][2]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
