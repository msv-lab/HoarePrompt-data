The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to the position `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are currently known; `cur` is the current position, and `piece` is equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

In this context, `parent` is being updated to reflect that the predecessor of the position `ncur` is now `cur` and the value of `piece` (which is 0). 

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1), `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
