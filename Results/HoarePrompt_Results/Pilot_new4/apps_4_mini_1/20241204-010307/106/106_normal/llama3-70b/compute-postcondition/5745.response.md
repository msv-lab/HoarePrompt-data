Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1). If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then the tuple (ncur, 1) has been appended to `queue`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `piece` is assigned to `parent[1][ncur]`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
