The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given that the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this implies that the new value for `dist[1][ncur]` will now become equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which will make it less than or equal to its previously existing value. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships and conditions continue to hold true.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` corresponds to the respective `cur` and `piece`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now less than or equal to its previous value.**
