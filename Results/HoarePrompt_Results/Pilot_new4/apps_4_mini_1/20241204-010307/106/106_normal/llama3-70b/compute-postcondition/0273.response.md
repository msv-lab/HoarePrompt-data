To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved in the context of the loop statement and its iterations.

The loop will iterate over a list of tuples representing directional movements: `(-2, -1)`, `(-2, 1)`, `(-1, -2)`, `(-1, 2)`, `(1, -2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, -1)`, `(2, 1)`. The variables `dx` and `dy` will be assigned the values from these tuples during each iteration of the loop.

Given the current state:
- `N` is an integer within the range 3 to 10.
- `y` is initialized to 0.
- The value of `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur` (indicating a specific reference in a 2D array or similar structure).

To ensure that the loop executes correctly:
1. The loop will execute 8 times, once for each tuple in the list.
2. The values of `dx` and `dy` are being assigned correctly from the tuple, so no conditions are needed for them.
3. `N`, `y`, and `A[x][0]` do not directly affect the loop execution itself, but any relevant implications of these values will depend on the loopâ€™s body.

Thus, for the loop to execute as intended:
- We can keep `N` in its valid range (3 to 10).
- `y` remains initialized to 0 (not directly impacting the loop).
- The value of `A[x][0]` being equal to `cur` does not prevent the loop from executing.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` will iterate over the directional movements.**
