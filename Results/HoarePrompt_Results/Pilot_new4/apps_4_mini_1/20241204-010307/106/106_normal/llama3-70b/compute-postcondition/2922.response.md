Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations. The final state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` depends on the valid positions `(nx, ny)` that were reached and had their distances updated based on the condition where `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. If no positions were reachable, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
