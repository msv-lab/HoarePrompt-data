The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Given the initial values, `x` is 1 and `dx` is 1, so `nx` will be `1 + 1` which equals `2`. Similarly, `y` is 1 and `dy` is 0, so `ny` will be `1 + 0` which equals `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0**
