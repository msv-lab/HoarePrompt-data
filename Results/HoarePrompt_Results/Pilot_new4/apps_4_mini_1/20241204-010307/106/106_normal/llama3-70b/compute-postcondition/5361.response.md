Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is not satisfied, no actions are performed.***
