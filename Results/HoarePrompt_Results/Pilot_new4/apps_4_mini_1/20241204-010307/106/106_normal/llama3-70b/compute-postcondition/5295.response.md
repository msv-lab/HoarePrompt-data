According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in the x and y coordinates (dx, dy). The loop will execute for each tuple in the list. In this case, there are 4 tuples: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -1, indicating that the loop has just executed the first tuple. To execute the loop one more time, we need to move to the next tuple in the list.

The next tuple is `(-1, 1)`, so `dx` will be -1 and `dy` will be 1 for the next iteration. The loop execution will continue until it has processed all tuples.

Therefore, to summarize the state adjustments needed:
- `dx` should be updated to -1 (as this remains unchanged for the next tuple).
- `dy` should be updated to 1 (moving to the next tuple in the list).

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -1**
