The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value for `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range from 0 to N-1, the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `piece` is equal to 0, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
