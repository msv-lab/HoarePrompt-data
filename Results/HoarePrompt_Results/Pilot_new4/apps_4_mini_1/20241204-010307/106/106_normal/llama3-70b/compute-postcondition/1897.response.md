Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4; if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and `N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 with `dist[1][ncur]` being greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, all relevant states remain unchanged.***
