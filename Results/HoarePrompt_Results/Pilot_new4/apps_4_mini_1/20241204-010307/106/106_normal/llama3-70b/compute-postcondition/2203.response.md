The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y` respectively. Given that `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1, `nx` becomes `x - 2` and `ny` becomes `y + 1`. The states of the other variables `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains one element `(ncur, 0)` in addition to the original element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.
