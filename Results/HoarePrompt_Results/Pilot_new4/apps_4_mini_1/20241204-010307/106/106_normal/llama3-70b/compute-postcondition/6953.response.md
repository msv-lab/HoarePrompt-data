According to the code, the loop will iterate over the tuples `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. The loop executes once for each tuple in the list, so the loop will execute a total of 4 times. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, and the loop has processed one of the tuples. The variable `y` is not directly modified within the loop; however, it is important to note that the loop iterates over the tuples while `dx` and `dy` are adjusted accordingly.

Since `dx` and `dy` are derived from the list of tuples and the loop has not completed all its iterations yet, we need to increment the index or consider the next tuple. After processing one tuple, we can deduce that we will move to the next tuple in the list, and for that, we need to maintain the states of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `cur`.

If the loop has processed one iteration, the next values to process will be the second tuple in the list. Thus, the state remains largely unchanged except for the loop counter which will now refer to the next tuple being processed.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, and `piece` is 1. The next tuple `(dx, dy)` to be processed will be `(-1, 1)` if the first tuple `(-1, -1)` has already been processed.**
