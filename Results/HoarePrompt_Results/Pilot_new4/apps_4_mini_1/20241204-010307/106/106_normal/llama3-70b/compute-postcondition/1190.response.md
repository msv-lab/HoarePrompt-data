To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the current state and the loop conditions closely.

Currently, we have:
- `N` is between 3 and 10, which indicates the valid range for indices.
- `x` is 1, `y` is 1.
- `nx` is calculated as `1 + dx` and `ny` as `1 + dy`, where `dx` and `dy` will take values from the pairs in the list `[(−1, −1), (−1, 1), (1, −1), (1, 1)]`.

The loop will iterate over these pairs of `dx` and `dy`. We need to determine what the values of `nx` and `ny` will be for the next iteration of the loop:

1. For the first iteration with `dx = -1` and `dy = -1`:
   - `nx = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`
   
2. For the second iteration with `dx = -1` and `dy = 1`:
   - `nx = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`
   
3. For the third iteration with `dx = 1` and `dy = -1`:
   - `nx = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`
   
4. For the fourth iteration with `dx = 1` and `dy = 1`:
   - `nx = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

The loop will execute four times, one for each pair of `(dx, dy)`. After each iteration, the values of `nx` and `ny` will be determined based on the current `(dx, dy)` pair.

At the end of the last iteration (the fourth one), `dx` and `dy` would have taken all pairs from the list. Therefore, to assess what the next state would be after the last iteration, we consider that there would be no more pairs left to iterate over.

To summarize:
- After the last iteration, we will not have new changes to `nx` and `ny`, and therefore `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will not be updated further. The loop conditions will still allow for the state to be valid as `N` remains between 3 and 10.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would logically be:
State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 2**
