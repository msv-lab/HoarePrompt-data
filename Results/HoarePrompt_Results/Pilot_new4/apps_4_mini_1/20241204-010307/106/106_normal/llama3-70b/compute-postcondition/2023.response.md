Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances with `dist[0][ncur]` equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects corresponding parents; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains (cur, i) if A[x][y] equals cur and piece is not equal to i; `dx` and `dy` will iterate through the 8 tuples in the list; `nx` is updated to `x + dx` and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0 and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
