Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
