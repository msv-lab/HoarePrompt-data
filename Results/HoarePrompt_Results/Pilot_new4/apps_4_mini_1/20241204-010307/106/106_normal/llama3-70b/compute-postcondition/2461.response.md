The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the previous values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `x` has not been defined in the initial state, so we will keep it as an unknown variable. The variable `y` is given as 1, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is -1.

The new values are calculated as follows:
- `nx = x + dx` becomes `nx = x - 2`
- `ny = y + dy` becomes `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0**
