The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple consisting of `ncur` and the value `1` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is already determined in the initial state, but `queue` will now contain an additional item.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the queue has been updated with a new entry based on the current value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` may store corresponding parents for those `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
