Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to any variables.***
