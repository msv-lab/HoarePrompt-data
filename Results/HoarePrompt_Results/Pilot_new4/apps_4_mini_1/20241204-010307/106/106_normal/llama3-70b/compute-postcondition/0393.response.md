The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. This operation does not change the values of any existing variables; it simply adds a new element to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include all the previous values, indicating that `queue` has a new entry.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
