Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `y + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 to N (exclusive), then `ncur` is set to `A[nx][ny]` and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
