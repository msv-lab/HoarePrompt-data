The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, and it also assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The variables `parent` and `ncur` are affected by this code. The values of `dist`, `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and the relationship between `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
