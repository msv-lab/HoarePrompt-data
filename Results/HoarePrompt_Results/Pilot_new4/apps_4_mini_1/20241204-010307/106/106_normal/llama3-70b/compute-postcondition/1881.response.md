Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, and the values of `cur`, `ncur`, `nx`, and `ny` remain valid for index calculations. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables related to the condition.***
