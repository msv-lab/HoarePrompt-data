According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directions (dx, dy). The number of iterations the loop can undergo is determined by the length of this list, which is fixed at 4 (the four possible directions).

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 2 and `piece` is set to 1. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list, iterating through four directions. After the last iteration, the loop has already processed the last tuple (the last direction). 

To execute one more time, the loop variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the next tuple in the list, but since there are only four tuples, after the last iteration, there are no more tuples left to iterate over. 

Therefore, after the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will no longer have valid values from the list of directions, and the loop cannot run again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1** (no changes to the state as the loop cannot execute again).
