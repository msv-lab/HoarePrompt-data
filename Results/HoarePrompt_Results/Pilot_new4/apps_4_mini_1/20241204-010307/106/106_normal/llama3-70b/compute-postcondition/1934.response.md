The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are such that they fall within the bounds of the indices of the array `A`, which is a 2-dimensional array. The initial conditions regarding `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `piece` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` remains unchanged, `piece` is unchanged, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.
