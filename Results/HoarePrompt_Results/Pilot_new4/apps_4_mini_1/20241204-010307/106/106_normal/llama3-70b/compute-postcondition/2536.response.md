The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` is unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` is unchanged, `dx, dy` are at the end of the list of directions, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` is unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` is unchanged, `dx, dy` are at the end of the list of directions, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
