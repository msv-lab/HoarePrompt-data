The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 
- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `1 + (-2)`, resulting in `nx = -1`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `N - 1 + 1`, resulting in `ny = N`.

The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1.**
