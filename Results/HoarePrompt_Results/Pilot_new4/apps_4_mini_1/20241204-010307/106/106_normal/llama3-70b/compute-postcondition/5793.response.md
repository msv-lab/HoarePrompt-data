According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction changes denoted by `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute for each of the tuples in this list. Since we are currently at the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `dx` as -2 and `dy` as -1 for the current iteration. As we move to the next iteration in the loop, the values of `dx` and `dy` will change to the next tuple in the list `[(dx, dy)]`, which is `(-2, 1)`.

The loop will continue executing until all tuples in the list have been processed, which means we need to ensure that `dx` and `dy` are set to the next values in the list, and there are no additional conditions that need to be updated based on the loop execution.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` has the new element `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][-1]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; otherwise, no changes occur if the condition 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N is not met.**
