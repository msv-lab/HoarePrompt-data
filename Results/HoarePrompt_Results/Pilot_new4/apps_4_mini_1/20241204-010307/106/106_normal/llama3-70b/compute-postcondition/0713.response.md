The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `value of piece`, `dist`, and `parent` are not affected by this operation. The only change is that the `queue` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `ny` equals `2 + dy`, `value of piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
