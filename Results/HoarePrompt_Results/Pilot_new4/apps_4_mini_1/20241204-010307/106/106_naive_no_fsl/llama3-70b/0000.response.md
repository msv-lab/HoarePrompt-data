Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the transition between different pieces on the chessboard. Specifically, the logic for moving from one square to another using a different piece is not correctly implemented. The following potential case can illustrate this issue:

Consider a chessboard setup as follows (N=3):

```
1  2  3
8  9  4
7  6  5
```

In this setup, the optimal path should allow for efficient transitions between pieces. However, the program's logic does not account for all valid transitions and does not correctly maintain the number of replacements as required by the problem description. 

For instance, if we start with the knight on square 1 and need to reach square 2, the knight can move directly. However, after reaching square 2, the only possible piece transitions and subsequent moves may not be optimal due to the way the BFS is structured and how transitions between piece types are managed.

Additionally, the variable `ans_replace` is only updated based on the last piece used, which may not reflect the actual minimum replacements correctly. This could lead to incorrect outputs when the optimal path involves more complex piece transitions.

Thus, there are scenarios where the output will not align with the problem's requirements. Hence, the program is deemed incorrect.
