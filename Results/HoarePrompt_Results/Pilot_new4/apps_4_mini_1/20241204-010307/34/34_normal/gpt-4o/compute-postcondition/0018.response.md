The function `adjust_solution` accepts five parameters: `x` and `y`, which are integers; `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd`, which are positive integers such that 0 < a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd ≤ 2·10^9; and `sign_a1` and `sign_a2`, which are integers. The output of the function returns the values of `x` and `y`. Specifically, the value of `y` may be increased by `a1_div_gcd` if the condition `b1 + a1 * x` is greater than `R`. If `b1 + a1 * x` is less than or equal to `R`, `y` remains unchanged. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x (integer), y (integer), a1_div_gcd (positive integer), a2_div_gcd (positive integer), sign_a1 (integer), and sign_a2 (integer). It returns the values of x and y, where y may be increased by a1_div_gcd if b1 + a1 * x is greater than R; otherwise, y remains unchanged.**
