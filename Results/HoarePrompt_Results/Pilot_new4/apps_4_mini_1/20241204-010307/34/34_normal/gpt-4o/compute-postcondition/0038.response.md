The value of `val` is calculated as `a1 * x0 + b1`. The states of the other variables `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `L`, `R`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `gcd`, `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `x0`, and `y0` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a1` and `a2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a1`, `a2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b1` and `b2` are integers in the range -2·10^9 ≤ `b1`, `b2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9; `A` = `a1`; `B` = -`a2`; `C` = `b2` - `b1`; `gcd`, `a1_div_gcd` is `a1 // gcd`; `a2_div_gcd` is `a2 // gcd`; `x0` is updated to `x0 + a2_div_gcd`; `y0` is updated to `y0 - a1_div_gcd`; `val` is equal to `a1 * x0 + b1`**.
