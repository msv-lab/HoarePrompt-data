The initial state indicates that `a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers, while `b_1` and `b_2` are integers. The conditions specify that the current value of `b_1 + a_1 * x` is greater than `R`, and for the previous condition involving `b_1 + a_1 * x < L`, it suggests a scenario where adjustments to `x` and `y` might have occurred based on `k`, `sign_a1`, and `gcd`. However, the specific adjustments to `x` and `y` are not given.

The code snippet `x -= a2_div_gcd` indicates that `x` is being decremented by `a_2_div_gcd`. Since the specific values of `x`, `a_2_div_gcd`, `y`, and other variables were not provided in the initial state, I will illustrate the impact of this line based on the known relationships.

The decrement of `x` implies that its value has decreased by `a_2_div_gcd`. Thus, the output state will reflect this change, while other variables' states will remain unchanged, since they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers; `x` is decreased by `a_2_div_gcd`.**
