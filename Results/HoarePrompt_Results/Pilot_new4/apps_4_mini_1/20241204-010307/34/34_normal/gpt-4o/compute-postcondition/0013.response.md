Postcondition: ***`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers. If `b_1 + a_1 * x` is less than `L`, then `k` is assigned a value based on the condition of `sign_a1`, resulting in `x` being updated to `x + k * a_2_div_gcd` and `y` being updated to `y - k * a_1_div_gcd`. The current value of `b_1 + a_1 * x` is greater than `R`.***
