The variable `k` is calculated as `(R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`. Therefore, after this calculation, `k` holds an integer value based on the current values of `R`, `b1`, `a1`, and `x`. The value of `x` is then incremented by `k * a2_div_gcd`.

Since `a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers, and `b_1` and `b_2` can range from -2·10^9 to 2·10^9, the updated value of `x` will be `x + k * a2_div_gcd`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a_1`, `a_2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `b_1`, `b_2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9; `sign_a1` is less than or equal to 0; `k` is calculated as (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd); `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`.**
