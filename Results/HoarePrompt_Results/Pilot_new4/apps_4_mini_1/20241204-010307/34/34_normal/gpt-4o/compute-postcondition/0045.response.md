Output State: **`x0` has been incremented by `n * a2_div_gcd`, where `n` is the number of times the loop executed, `y0` has been decremented by `n * a1_div_gcd`, `count` contains the count of all valid `val` values that were within the range defined by `L` and `R`, and `val` is the last calculated value that exceeds `R`. `val` equals `a1 * x0 + b1`, indicating that the loop executed until the calculated value exceeded `R`, thus ensuring `val` was within the specified limits for `count` updates at least `n` times.**
