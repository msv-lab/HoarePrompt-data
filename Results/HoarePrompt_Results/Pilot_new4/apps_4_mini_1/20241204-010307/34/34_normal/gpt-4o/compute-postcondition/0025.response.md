The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `L`, `R`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `gcd`, `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `x0`, `y0`, and `val` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `a2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a1`, `a2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b1` and `b2` are integers in the range -2·10^9 ≤ `b1`, `b2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9; `A` = `a1`; `B` = -`a2`; `C` = `b2` - `b1`; `gcd`, `a1_div_gcd` is `a1 // gcd`, `a2_div_gcd` is `a2 // gcd`; `x0` and `y0` are updated from `adjust_solution(x0, y0, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, 1, -1)`; `count` is 1; the current value of `val`, which equals `a1 * x0 + b1`, is within the range defined by `L` and `R`, meaning that `L` ≤ `val` ≤ `R`.
