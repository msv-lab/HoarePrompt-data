The statement `val = a1 * x0 + b1` calculates the value of `val` based on the values of `a1`, `x0`, and `b1`. Since `a1` is a positive integer and both `b1` and `x0` can be integers (with no further restrictions provided), `val` will be a computed integer based on these values. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a1` and `a2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a1`, `a2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b1` and `b2` are integers in the range -2·10^9 ≤ `b1`, `b2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9; `A` = `a1`; `B` = -`a2`; `C` = `b2` - `b1`; `gcd`, `a1_div_gcd` is `a1 // gcd`, `a2_div_gcd` is `a2 // gcd`; `x0` and `y0` are updated from `adjust_solution(x0, y0, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, 1, -1)`; `count` is 0; `val` is equal to `a1 * x0 + b1`.**
