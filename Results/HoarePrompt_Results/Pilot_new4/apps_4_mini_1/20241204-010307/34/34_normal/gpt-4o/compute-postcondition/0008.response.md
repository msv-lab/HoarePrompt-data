Postcondition: ***`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers. If `sign_a1` is greater than 0, then `k` is assigned the value of `(L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`, `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`, and `y` is updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd`. If `sign_a1` is less than or equal to 0, then `k` is calculated as `(R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`, `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`, and `y` is updated to `y - (k * a1_div_gcd)`.***
