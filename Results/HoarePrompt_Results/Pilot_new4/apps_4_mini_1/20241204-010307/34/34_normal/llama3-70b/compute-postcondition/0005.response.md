The variable `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the value of `a_1 % b`. Since `b` was originally a non-zero value, `a` takes on the previous value of `b`, while `b` becomes the result of the modulus operation. The values of `a_1` and `a_2` remain unchanged, and they are both positive integers.

Output State: **`a_1` is a positive integer, `a_2` is a positive integer, `b` is equal to `a_1 % b`, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`.**
