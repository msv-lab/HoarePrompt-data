According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. For the loop to execute one time, `b` must evaluate to a truthy value (i.e., it must be non-zero). 

Right before the loop, we have the following states: `a_1`, `a_2` are positive integers and `b_1`, `b_2`, `L`, `R` are integers. However, the specific value of `b` is not given in the initial state. For the loop to execute, `b` must be a non-zero value. 

Since `b` is not mentioned as having a specific value or condition, we cannot determine if it is currently zero or non-zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `b` is not equal to zero.

State: **`a_1` is a positive integer, `a_2` is a positive integer, `b` must be non-zero**
