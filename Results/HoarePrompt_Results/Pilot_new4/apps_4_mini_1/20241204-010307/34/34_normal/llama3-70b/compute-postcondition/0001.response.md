The values of `a` and `b` are assigned in a tuple unpacking operation. The variable `a` takes the current value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. Since `a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers, `a` will be assigned the value of `b`, and `b` will be assigned the result of `a % b`, which will also be a positive integer as long as `b` is not zero. 

The initial variables, `a_1`, `a_2`, and `b`, remain valid but their relationships change slightly upon execution. The output state now includes the new values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a_1` is a positive integer, `a_2` is a positive integer, `b` must be non-zero; `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is equal to `a_1 % b`.**
