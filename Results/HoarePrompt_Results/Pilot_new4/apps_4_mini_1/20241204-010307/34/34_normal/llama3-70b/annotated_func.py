#State of the program right berfore the function call: a_1, a_2 are positive integers such that 0 < a_1, a_2 ≤ 2·10^9; b_1, b_2, L, R are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ b_1, b_2, L, R ≤ 2·10^9 and L ≤ R.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a_1` and `b` (where `b` is the initial value before the loop started).
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a_1` and `b`, where `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `a` and an integer `b`, and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. It correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, and since `b` can be zero in the initial call, it can handle this case appropriately by returning `a` if `b` is zero at the beginning of the function.
