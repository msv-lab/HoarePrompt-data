The value of `pairs` is assigned the result of the expression `(n + 1) * max_9s`. Since `n` is 0, the calculation simplifies to `pairs = (0 + 1) * max_9s`, which means `pairs = 1 * max_9s`, effectively making `pairs` equal to `max_9s`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `max_9s` is the number of trailing nines in the original value of `n`, and `pairs` is equal to `max_9s`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is the number of trailing nines in the original value of `n`, `pairs` is equal to `max_9s`.**
