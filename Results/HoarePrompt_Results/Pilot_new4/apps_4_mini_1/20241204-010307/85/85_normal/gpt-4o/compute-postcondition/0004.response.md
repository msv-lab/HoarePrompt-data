`n` is assigned the value of `n // 10`, which means `n` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since `n` must be 9 or greater than 9 but one less than a multiple of 10, the possible values for `n` can be 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, or 99. After applying integer division by 10, the values of `n` will become 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 respectively. The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9; `max_9s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9; `max_9s` is 1**.
