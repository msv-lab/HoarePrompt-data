To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down both the code and the description.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The costs of shovels are simply their indices (i.e., the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second costs 2 burles, etc.). 

### Provided Code
```python
n = int(input())
max_9s = 0
while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
    max_9s += 1
    n //= 10
pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
print(pairs)
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Finding Trailing Nines**: The code increments `max_9s` while `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This means it is counting how many times the last digit of `n + 1` is a zero, which implies how many times `n + 1` can be divided by 10. This does not logically correspond to finding pairs of shovels where the sum ends in nines.

2. **Calculating Pairs**: It calculates `(n + 1) * max_9s` as the number of pairs. The logic here seems flawed because the relationship between the number of trailing nines and the pairs of shovels is not properly established.

### Edge Cases
- For `n = 10`, `max_9s` would be `1` (because `11 % 10 == 0`), and thus it would compute `pairs = (10 + 1) * 1 = 11`, which is incorrect based on the examples given in the description.
- The function is also not directly handling the case when `n` is a number like `49` or `50` as described; it will not correctly compute how many pairs result in a total cost ending in nines.

### Output Hints
The output hints claim that the function counts trailing nines in `n` and calculates pairs based on that count. This seems to suggest that the function is intended to calculate based on the number of trailing zeros in `n + 1`, which does not correspond to the original problem. 

### Conclusion
The code does not accurately follow the problem description and fails in specific cases, particularly not accounting for all necessary pairs that sum to a number ending in maximum nines. The reasoning presented in the output hints also does not align with the logic needed to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program will not produce the correct number of pairs for the given inputs as illustrated by the examples. For instance, it fails to handle scenarios like `n = 10` and `n = 50` correctly.
