The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and calculates the number of trailing nines in the original value of `n`. It then calculates the value of `(n + 1)` multiplied by the count of trailing nines and prints the result as `pairs`. The function does not have a return statement, so it does not return any value.
