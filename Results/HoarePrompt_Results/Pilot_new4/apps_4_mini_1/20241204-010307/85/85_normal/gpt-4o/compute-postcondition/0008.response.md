To determine whether the loop can execute again, we need to analyze the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This condition checks if `n + 1` is a multiple of 10. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 0. Therefore, `n + 1` equals 1, which is not a multiple of 10. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to modify `n` so that `n + 1` becomes a multiple of 10. 

If we want `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, it implies that `n + 1` must equal 10, 20, 30, etc. The smallest value that satisfies this is when `n + 1` equals 10, which means `n` must be adjusted to 9.

No other states need to be adjusted since `max_9s` is irrelevant to the loop condition.

State: **`n` must be adjusted to 9, `max_9s` is 2**
