According to the code, the loop is set to execute for `i` ranging from 1 to `n // 2`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 since the lowest value for `n` is 2 (as stated by the condition 2 ≤ `n`). This will allow `i` to take the value of 1 in the first iteration of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is 0, and before the loop starts, `i` would need to be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
