The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1, so the new value of `ans` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 6 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 2, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 6 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 2, `i` is 3**
