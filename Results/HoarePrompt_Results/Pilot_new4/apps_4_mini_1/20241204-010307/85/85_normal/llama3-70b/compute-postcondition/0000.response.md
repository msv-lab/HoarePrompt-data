`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must still satisfy the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
