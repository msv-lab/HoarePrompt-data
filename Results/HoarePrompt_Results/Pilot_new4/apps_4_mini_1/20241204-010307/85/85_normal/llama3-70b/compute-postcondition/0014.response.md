The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on a variable `n`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). As the output details are not provided, we cannot specify the return value of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to operate based on the value of `n` while ensuring that it falls within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer `n` that must satisfy the condition \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), though the specific return value is not defined.**
