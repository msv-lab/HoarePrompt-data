The list `a` is created by taking user input `n` times, and each input is converted to an integer. Since `a_i` are positive integers within the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), the values in `a` will all be positive integers within this specified range. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input, `m` is a positive integer based on user input such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 10,000 \), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \text{ for } i \text{ from } 1 \text{ to } n \)**
