The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous constraints for `n` still hold, meaning `n` will now be a positive integer, but its specific value has changed based on user input. The other variables `m` and `a_i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10,000, and `a_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i from 1 to n.**
