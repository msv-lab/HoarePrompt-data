Let's analyze the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The program needs to determine the minimum and maximum possible number of people sitting on the most occupied bench after `m` additional people come to the park, given `n` benches each with an initial number of occupants.

### Program:
```python
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
min_k = max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n
max_k = max(a) + m
print(min_k, max_k)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Maximum Possible `k` (`max_k`)**:
   - The calculation for `max_k` is `max(a) + m`. This is correct because all `m` new people could sit on the bench that already has the most occupants. 

2. **Minimum Possible `k` (`min_k`)**:
   - The calculation for `min_k` is `max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n`. This formula intends to distribute the `m` new people as evenly as possible among the `n` benches. 
   - The expression `(m + n - 1) // n` effectively computes the ceiling of `m/n`, which corresponds to the minimum extra people that would need to be added to the most occupied bench to account for evenly distributing `m` people across all benches.

### Edge Cases:
- The program should handle the case where `n = 1` (there's only one bench). In this case, both `min_k` and `max_k` should output the same value since all `m` people will sit on that bench.
- The program should also handle the case where `m` is exactly divisible by `n`, ensuring that the distribution still works correctly.

### Output Hints:
The output hints specify that the function calculates `min_k` as described and `max_k` correctly. Both hints align with the logic in the code.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The calculations for both `min_k` and `max_k` are accurate based on the provided specifications. The output hints corroborate this assessment.

Correctness: **True**.
