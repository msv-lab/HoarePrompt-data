Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters directly but reads input values for a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100), a positive integer `m` (where 1 <= m <= 10,000), and a list of positive integers `a_i` (where 1 <= a_i <= 100 for i from 1 to n). It calculates `min_k` as the maximum value in the list `a` plus the ceiling of `m/n`, and `max_k` as the maximum value in `a` plus `m`. Finally, it prints the values of `min_k` and `max_k`. The function does not return any values. **
