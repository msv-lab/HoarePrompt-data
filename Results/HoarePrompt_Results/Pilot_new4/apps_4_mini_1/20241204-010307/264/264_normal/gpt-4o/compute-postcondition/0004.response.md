The `total_people` variable is assigned the value of the sum of the integers in the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` consists of `n` integers, each also between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Therefore, `total_people` will be the total of these integers in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100 inclusive), `initial_max` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `total_people` is the sum of the integers in `a`.**
