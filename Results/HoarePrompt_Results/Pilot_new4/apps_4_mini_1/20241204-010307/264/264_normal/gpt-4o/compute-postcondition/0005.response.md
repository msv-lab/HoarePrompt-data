The variable `max_k` is assigned the value of `initial_max + m`. The variable `initial_max` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `m` is an integer that can be any input integer. Therefore, the value of `max_k` now becomes the sum of the maximum value from the list `a` and the input integer `m`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100 inclusive), `initial_max` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `total_people` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `max_k` is equal to `initial_max + m`.**
