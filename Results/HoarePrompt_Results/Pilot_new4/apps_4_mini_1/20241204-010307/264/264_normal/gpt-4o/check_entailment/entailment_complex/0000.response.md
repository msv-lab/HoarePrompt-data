To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program logic step by step.

1. **Inputs**:
   - The program reads the number of benches `n` and the number of additional people `m`.
   - It then reads the current number of people sitting on each of the `n` benches into a list `a`.

2. **Calculations**:
   - The program calculates `initial_max`, which is the maximum number of people currently sitting on any bench (`max(a)`).
   - It computes `total_people`, which is the sum of all people currently sitting on all benches (`sum(a)`).
   - The program then calculates `max_k` as `initial_max + m`. This represents the scenario where all additional people choose to sit on the bench that already has the most people, hence maximizing the maximum number of people on one bench.
   - For `min_k`, the program computes `(total_people + m + n - 1) // n`. This calculation effectively gives the ceiling of the average number of people per bench after distributing the additional `m` people as evenly as possible across all `n` benches.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs both `min_k` and `max_k`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Maximum possible `k`**: The calculation of `max_k` is straightforward and correct. It effectively captures the maximum number of people that could be sitting on a bench after all newcomers choose the bench with the highest current occupancy.
   - **Minimum possible `k`**: The calculation for `min_k` is accurate in capturing the smallest possible maximum occupancy after distributing the newcomers as evenly as possible. The formula `(total_people + m + n - 1) // n` employs integer division to correctly handle rounding up, ensuring that if there is a remainder when dividing the total occupancy after newcomers by the number of benches, you account for that by effectively adding an additional 'bench' in a sense.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where there is only one bench correctly, as both `min_k` and `max_k` would be the same.
   - It also correctly processes the limits of `n` and `m`, ensuring that all values remain within their defined constraints.

Given all of the above, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases described.

Correctness: **True**
