To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its behavior based on the problem description and potential edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**:
   - `n`: Number of benches.
   - `m`: Number of additional people.
   - `a_i`: Initial number of people on each bench.
   
2. **Output**:
   - Minimum possible `k`: The minimum maximum occupancy of any bench after all additional people have taken their seats.
   - Maximum possible `k`: The maximum occupancy of a bench after all additional people have taken their seats.

### Analysis of the Program
The program calculates:
- `min_k = max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n`: This computes the minimum maximum occupancy. It adds the average number of additional people (`m/n`) to the maximum current occupancy.
- `max_k = max(a) + m`: This computes the maximum possible occupancy by adding all additional people to the bench with the highest initial occupancy.

### Edge Cases Testing
Let's consider various scenarios to check if the program holds true:

1. **Single Bench (n=1)**:
   - Input: `1 5 5`
     - `min_k` should be `5 + (5 + 1 - 1) // 1 = 5 + 5 = 10`
     - `max_k` should be `5 + 5 = 10`
     - **Expected Output**: `10 10`, but the program will output `10 10` (correct).

2. **All Benches Equal**:
   - Input: `3 6 2 2 2`
     - `min_k`: `max(2, 2, 2) + (6+3-1)//3 = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - `max_k`: `max(2, 2, 2) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8`
     - **Expected Output**: `4 8`, but the program will output `4 8` (correct).

3. **More People than Benches**:
   - Input: `3 10 1 1 1`
     - `min_k`: `max(1,1,1) + (10+3-1)//3 = 1 + 3 = 4`
     - `max_k`: `max(1,1,1) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11`
     - **Expected Output**: `4 11`, but the program will output `4 11` (correct).

4. **Maximum Edge Cases**:
   - Input: `100 10000` with all `a_i = 100`
     - The program should handle the upper limits correctly:
     - `min_k`: `max(100) + (10000 + 100 - 1) // 100 = 100 + 100 = 200`
     - `max_k`: `100 + 10000 = 10100`
     - **Expected Output**: `200 10100`, the program will output `200 10100` (correct).

### Conclusion
Since the program correctly outputs the expected results for all tested cases, including edge cases (single bench, more people than benches, maximum constraints), we can conclude that the logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the analysis above, the result is:
Correctness: **True**.
