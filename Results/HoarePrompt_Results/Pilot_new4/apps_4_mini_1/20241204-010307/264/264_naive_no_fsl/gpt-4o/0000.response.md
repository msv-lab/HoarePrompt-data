To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze it against the problem description and evaluate the logic used in the code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to calculate two values: 
   - Minimum possible maximum number of people on any bench (`min_k`)
   - Maximum possible maximum number of people on any bench (`max_k`).

2. Given:
   - `n`: Number of benches.
   - `m`: Number of additional people.
   - `a`: A list of integers where each integer `a[i]` signifies the number of people currently on the `i`-th bench.

### Logic Evaluated in the Program:
- **Maximum (`max_k`) Calculation**:
  - `max_k = initial_max + m`
  - This part is correct as it assumes all additional people can sit on the bench with the current maximum occupancy.

- **Minimum (`min_k`) Calculation**:
  - `min_k = (total_people + m + n - 1) // n`
  - The expression is intended to evenly distribute the total people (current + newcomers) across benches. This formula uses integer division to round up when necessary, which is valid for finding the minimum maximum occupancy.

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **Single Bench**:
   - The program correctly identifies that all additional people will sit on that bench, and thus `min_k` and `max_k` should be equal, which is handled correctly.

2. **All benches with the same number of people**:
   - The program still correctly computes the values since it sums the total and distributes evenly.

3. **Different distributions of `a_i`**:
   - The logic should still hold as it calculates the total and distributes accordingly.

### Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    6
    1
    1
    1
    1
    ```
  - Output: 
    ```
    3 7
    ```
  - Correct, as explained in the problem.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input:
    ```
    1
    10
    5
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    15 15
    ```
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    6
    1
    6
    5
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    6 12
    ```
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    7
    1
    6
    5
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    7 13
    ```
  - Correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly calculates both `min_k` and `max_k` for the provided problem description without missing any edge cases or logical errors.

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly accounts for different distributions of people across benches and handles all specified edge cases per the problem statement.
