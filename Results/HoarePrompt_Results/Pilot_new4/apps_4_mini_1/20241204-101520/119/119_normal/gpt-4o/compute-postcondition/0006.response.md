The code snippet executes a print statement which does not change any variable values. The conditions are such that the output will print 'YES', but no variables are modified or assigned new values. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9; additionally, `x` is not equal to `t`, `x` is greater than `t`, and the current value of `(x - t) % s` is equal to 0; printed 'YES'**.
