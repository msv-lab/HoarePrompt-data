Functionality: ** The function reads three non-negative integers `t`, `s`, and `x` from input. It returns 'YES' if `x` is equal to `t`, or if `x` is greater than `t` and either `(x - t) % s == 0` or `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` (provided `x` is not equal to `t + 1`). In all other cases, it returns 'NO'. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the function also returns 'NO'. **
