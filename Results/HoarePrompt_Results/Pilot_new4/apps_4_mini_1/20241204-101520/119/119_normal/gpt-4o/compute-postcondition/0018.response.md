The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the non-negative integers `t`, `s`, and `x`, which are assumed to be provided in the context where the function is called. The constraints specify that `t` and `x` can range from 0 to 10^9, while `s` must be at least 2 and can be as large as 10^9. 

Since the output based on these variables is not explicitly provided in the prompt, we cannot determine the specific return values or the conditions under which they are returned. Consequently, we can summarize the functionality based on the input constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but operates on non-negative integers t, s, and x with specified constraints and returns a value based on these integers.**
