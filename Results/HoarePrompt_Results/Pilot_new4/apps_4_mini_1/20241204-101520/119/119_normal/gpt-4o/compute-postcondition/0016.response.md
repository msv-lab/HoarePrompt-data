Postcondition: ***`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9; additionally, `x` is not equal to `t`. If `x` is greater than `t`, the output will be 'YES' if either `(x - t) % s == 0` or `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` (provided `x` is not equal to `t + 1`); otherwise, the output will be 'NO'. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the output will be 'NO'.***
