Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the count of such numbers within a given range. The modulo operation is also correctly applied at the end to ensure the result is within the required bounds. 

The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description for every input. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct, therefore the program is deemed correct.
