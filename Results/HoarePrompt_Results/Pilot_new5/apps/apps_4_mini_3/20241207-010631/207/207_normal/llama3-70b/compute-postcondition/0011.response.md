The line `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` indicates that we are updating the value at index `i + a` in the `dp` array by adding the current value at index `i`. The variable `i` is calculated as `m + 1`, so we can substitute that into the equation.

From the initial state:
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a positive integer.
- `b` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `m + 1`.

Thus, `i + a` equals `(m + 1) + a`, which simplifies to `m + a + 1`.

We update the `dp` array at index `m + a + 1` by adding the value at `dp[m + 1]`. The value at `dp[m + 1]` remains unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the impact of the code on the program is that the value at index `dp[m + a + 1]` is increased by the value at `dp[m + 1]`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `i` is `m + 1`, and `dp[m + a + 1]` is updated to `dp[m + a + 1] + dp[m + 1]`.**
