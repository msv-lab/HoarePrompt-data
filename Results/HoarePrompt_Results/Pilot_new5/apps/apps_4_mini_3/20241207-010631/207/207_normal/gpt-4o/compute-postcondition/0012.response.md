Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor `g` of `a` and `b` using `func_1`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with `m` divided by `g`, `a` divided by `g`, and `b` divided by `g`, and multiplies the result by `g`. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the first `k` integers and the adjusted sum of the first `m` integers, returning their total. The function handles cases where `m` is less than `k` and where the recursion occurs when `g` is greater than 1.**
