Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers. The list `dp` will have its zeroth index as 1, and indexes from `1` to `m` will be updated based on the operations performed in the loop. Specifically, `dp[i + a]` will accumulate the values of `dp[i]` for all valid `i`, and `dp[i]` will accumulate values from `dp[i - b]` for all valid `i`. After the loop completes, `dp` will represent the number of ways to reach each index from 0 to `m` based on the steps defined by `a` and `b`.**
