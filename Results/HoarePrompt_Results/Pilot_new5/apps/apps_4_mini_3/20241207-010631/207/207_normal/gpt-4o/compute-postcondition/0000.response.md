The variable `g` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `a` and `b` are defined as positive integers within the specified ranges, but the specific behavior of `func_1` is not defined here. Therefore, `g` becomes the output of that function. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is the output of `func_1(a, b)`.**
