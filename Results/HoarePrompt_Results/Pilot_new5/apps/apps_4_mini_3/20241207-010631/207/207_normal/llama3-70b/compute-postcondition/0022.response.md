The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates under the constraints that `m` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 10^9, and `a` and `b` are positive integers ranging from 1 to 100,000. Given the lack of specific output conditions in the provided output information, we can only generalize the expected functionality based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates with the constraints that m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), a and b are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^5). The exact return value is not specified.**
