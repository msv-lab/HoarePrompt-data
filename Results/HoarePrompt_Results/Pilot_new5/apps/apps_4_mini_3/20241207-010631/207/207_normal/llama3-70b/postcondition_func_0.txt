The function accepts three positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b` from user input, where `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^5`. It calculates the number of ways to reach each index from `0` to `m` based on steps defined by `a` (forward step) and `b` (backward step). The function returns the total number of ways to reach index `m` after processing the dynamic programming list `dp`. However, the exact output is not stored or returned; instead, it is printed directly. Note that for larger values of `m`, memory consumption will be significant due to the size of the `dp` list.
