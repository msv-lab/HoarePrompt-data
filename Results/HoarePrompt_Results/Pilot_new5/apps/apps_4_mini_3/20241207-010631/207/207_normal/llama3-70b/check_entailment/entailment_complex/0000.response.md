Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The main issues are as follows:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Distinct Reachable Integers**: The function should count the distinct integers that the frog can reach for each position `i` from `0` to `m`, which is denoted as `f(i)`. However, the program attempts to calculate the number of ways to reach each index using a dynamic programming approach, which does not align with the requirement of counting distinct integers reachable.

2. **Improper Use of the DP Array**: The array `dp` is initialized to count the number of ways to reach each position. However, the problem description requires counting distinct reachable integers, not the number of ways to reach a given integer. The accumulation in `dp[i]` should not involve adding values from `dp[i - b]`, as it can lead to incorrect counts when dealing with backward jumps.

3. **Output Does Not Match Requirement**: The function prints the sum of the values in the `dp` array, which does not correspond to the sum of `f(i)` from `0` to `m` as required by the problem description. The final output should reflect the sum of distinct reachable integers, not the sum of counts of ways to reach those integers.

To summarize, the program's logic does not align with the problem's requirements, particularly in how it calculates the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each `i`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
