Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `result` has at least `i + 2` characters, and `counts` is not empty. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, `result` is updated at index `i` to `char`, and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
