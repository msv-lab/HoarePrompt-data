The code `print('===')` outputs a string to the console but does not modify any variables or their values. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `s` also retains its value. Therefore, the output state remains reflective of the initial conditions, including the fact that `n` is still such that `n % 4` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`; `s` is equal to `data[1]`. The current value of `n` is such that `n % 4` is not equal to 0.**
