The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer between 4 and 255, and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. After executing the function body, the function may return nothing (None) in multiple scenarios: if it reaches the end without returning any specific value or if there are points in the code with no specified return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s`, but ultimately returns None in all cases considered. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 4 and 255) and `s` (a string of length n consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'), and returns None in all cases.**
