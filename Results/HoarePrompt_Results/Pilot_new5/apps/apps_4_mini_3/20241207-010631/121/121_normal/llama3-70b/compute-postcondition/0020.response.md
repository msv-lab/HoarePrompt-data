`count[c]` is assigned the value of `avg - count[c]`. The variable `avg` is equal to `n // 4`, and `count['T']` is updated to `n // 4 - count['T']` previously. Therefore, `count[c]` will be updated based on the current value of `count[c]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count['T']` is updated to `n // 4 - count['T']`; `count[c]` is updated to `n // 4 - count[c]`.**
