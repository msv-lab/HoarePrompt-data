The function `func` does not have any parameters as defined in the provided signature. However, it is implied that the function operates with two constraints: `n` is an integer within the range 4 to 255, and `s` is a string of length `n` that consists of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The output behavior is not defined in the prompt, so we cannot specify what it returns based on the output description. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, the functionality of the function remains unspecified. 

Functionality: **The function has no parameters, but it operates with an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string s of length n consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The return value is unspecified.**
