The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the last character of `s`, `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT', `res` is updated to `res + nc`, `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
