Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 3`, `i` is at `i + 3`, `counts` is a non-empty iterable with at least `i + 3` characters, and `char` is the next character in `counts`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[i]` is updated to `char`, `counts[char]` is increased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
