The value of `res` is incremented by `nc`, which is determined based on the last character `c` of the string `s` (which has a length of `n`). The new value of `res` will be equal to its previous value plus the value of `nc`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the last character of `s`, `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT', and `res` is updated to `res + nc`.**
