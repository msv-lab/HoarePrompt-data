The variable `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. The initial state provides that `counts` is not empty and that `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`. After the increment, `counts[char]` will now be at least the value it was previously plus 1, but it still remains less than `target_count`. The values of `n`, `i`, `result`, and `counts` other than `counts[char]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `result` has at least `i + 1` characters, `counts` is not empty, `counts[char]` is now greater than or equal to its previous value plus 1 and still less than `target_count`.**
