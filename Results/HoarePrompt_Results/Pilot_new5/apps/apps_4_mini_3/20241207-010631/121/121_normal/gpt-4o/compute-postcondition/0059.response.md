The value of `result[i]` is assigned the value of `char`. Since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, the assignment to `result[i]` is valid. The specific values of `n`, `i`, `result`, `counts`, and `target_count` remain unchanged except for the assignment of `char` to `result[i]`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `result` has at least `i + 1` characters, `counts` is not empty, `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and `result[i]` is assigned the value `char`.**
