The code `print('===')` outputs the string '===' to the console but does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length equal to `n`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary containing at least 2 of the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and `char` is the next key in `counts` that is not the second key with `counts[char]` less than or equal to `target_count`.**
