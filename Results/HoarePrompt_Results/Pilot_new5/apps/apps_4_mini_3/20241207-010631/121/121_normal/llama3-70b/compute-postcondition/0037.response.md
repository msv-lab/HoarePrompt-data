The code `res += nc` indicates that the variable `res` will now include the value of `nc`. Assuming `nc` is the next character in the sequence ('C', 'G', or 'T') as described in the initial state, `res` will be updated to contain the concatenated result of its previous value and the character `nc`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count[nc]` is -1 if `count[nc] > 0`, `c` is set to '?', `res` is updated to `res + nc`, where `res` now contains its previous value concatenated with `nc`, and `nc` is the next character in the sequence ('C', 'G', or 'T').**
