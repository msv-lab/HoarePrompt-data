The value of `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. Since `char` is one of the keys in `counts`, the corresponding value for that key will increase by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}, and `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `char` is the first character in `s` and is one of the keys in `counts`.**
