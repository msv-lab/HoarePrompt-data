The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `result` has at least `i + 1` characters, `counts` is not empty, `counts[char]` is now greater than or equal to its previous value plus 1 and still less than `target_count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
