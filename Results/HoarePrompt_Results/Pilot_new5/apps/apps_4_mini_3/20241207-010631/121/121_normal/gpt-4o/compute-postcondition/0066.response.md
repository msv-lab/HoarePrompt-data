The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `result` is updated at index `i` to `char`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
