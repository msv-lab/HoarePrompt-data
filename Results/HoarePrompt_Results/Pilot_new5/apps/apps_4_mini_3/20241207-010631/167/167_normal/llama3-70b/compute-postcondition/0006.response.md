The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py`, respectively. Since `nx` is calculated as `(v - 1) // y` and `ny` as `(v - 1) % y`, we are directly changing `px` and `py` to these new values. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must contain at least 1 element, `v` is the first element of the list `a`, `px` is equal to `nx` which is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is equal to `ny` which is `(v - 1) % y`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y, and the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is equal to 1.**
