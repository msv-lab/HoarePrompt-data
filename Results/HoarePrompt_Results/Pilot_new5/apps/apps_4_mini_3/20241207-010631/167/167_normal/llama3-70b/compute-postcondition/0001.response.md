According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one integer, which it does since `n` is defined to be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `px` and `py` are both initialized to 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

At the start of the loop, `v` should take the value of the first element in the list `a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `v` is assigned the first element of `a`, which is `a[0]`. 

So, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:
- `a` is a list of integers containing at least 1 element,
- `v` is the first element of the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers that must contain at least 1 element, `v` is the first element of the list `a`, `px` is 0, `py` is 0**
