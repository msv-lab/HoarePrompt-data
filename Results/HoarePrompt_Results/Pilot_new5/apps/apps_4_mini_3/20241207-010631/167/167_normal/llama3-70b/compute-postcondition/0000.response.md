The variables `px` and `py` are assigned the value of `0`. The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `px` is 0, `py` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `px` is 0, `py` is 0**.
