Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must contain at least 1 element, `v` is the first element of the list `a`, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y. The current value of (abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)) is not equal to 1.***
