According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the list `a`. The variable `v` represents the current element of the list `a` that the loop is processing. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is the first element of the list `a`, and since `a` contains at least 1 element, for the loop to execute one more time, `v` must take the value of the next element in the list.

Given that `n` is an integer representing the length of list `a` and must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `v` corresponds to the next element in the list. Therefore, if we are in the first iteration, and `v` is the first element of `a`, for the next iteration `v` will be the second element of the list.

Since `px` and `py` are calculated based on `v` and we are moving to the next `v`, we also need to recalculate `px` and `py` based on the new `v`. Hence, if `v` is updated to the second element, we can compute `nx` and `ny` accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must contain at least 2 elements, `v` is the second element of the list `a`, `px` is equal to `nx` which is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is equal to `ny` which is `(v - 1) % y`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y, and the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is equal to 1.**
