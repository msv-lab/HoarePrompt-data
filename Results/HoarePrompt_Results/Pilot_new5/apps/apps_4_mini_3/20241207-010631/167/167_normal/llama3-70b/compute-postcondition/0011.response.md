The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py`, respectively. Since the values of `nx` and `ny` are not specified in the initial state, but we know the conditions regarding the absolute differences, we can conclude that `px` takes the value of `nx` and `py` takes the value of `ny`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 2 elements, `v` is the second element of the list `a`, `px` is assigned the value of `nx`, and `py` is assigned the value of `ny`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 2 elements, `v` is the second element of the list `a`, `px` is assigned the value of `nx`, `py` is assigned the value of `ny`.**
