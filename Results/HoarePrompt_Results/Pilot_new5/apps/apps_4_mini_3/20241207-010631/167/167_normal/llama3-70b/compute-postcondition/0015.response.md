Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000 and at least 3. `a` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 3 elements. `v` is the third element of the list `a`, `px` is assigned the value of `nx`, `py` is assigned the value of `ny`, where `nx` is calculated as `(v - 1) // y`, and `ny` is calculated as `(v - 1) % y`. If the expression `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1` evaluates to true, the function returns False.***
