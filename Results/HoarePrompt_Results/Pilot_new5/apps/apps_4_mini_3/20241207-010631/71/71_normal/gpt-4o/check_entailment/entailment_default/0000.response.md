To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description and the output hints, let's break down the components step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task requires finding the minimum number of digits to be deleted from an integer `n` so that the resulting number is divisible by `10^k`. The result should not start with unnecessary leading zeros, except for the single case where the result is zero.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)
```

### Observations:
1. The program reads `n` as a string and `k` as an integer, which is correct.
2. It counts trailing zeros from `n` and counts the non-zero digits up to `k` zeros.
3. If `count_zeros` reaches `k`, it prints the count of non-zero digits encountered before reaching the zeros, which indicates the number of digits to be removed.
4. If there are fewer than `k` zeros, it defaults to printing `len(n) - 1`, which suggests removing all digits but one.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- If `n` is `0`, the output should be `0` (no digits to remove) since it is already divisible by any number.
- If `n` has fewer than `k` zeros at the end, the output would be `len(n) - 1`, which might leave only one leading non-zero digit, failing to produce a valid output, particularly in cases where `n` has no zeros at all.
- Cases where `n` has exactly `k` zeros but also contains significant non-zero digits before those zeros. The program does not account for scenarios where choosing different non-zero digits might lead to a lesser number of digits removed.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function prints the count of non-zero digits if `k` zeros are found. It also states that if there are not enough trailing zeros, the function will print `len(n) - 1`, which could be misleading if fewer than `k` zeros are present.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not account for scenarios adequately, particularly when:
- `n` has no trailing zeros.
- Leading non-zero digits may remain after trimming most of the digits.

Given these considerations, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements for all cases as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The program fails to handle cases where `n` has insufficient trailing zeros properly, resulting in potentially erroneous outputs. For instance, if `n = '123'` and `k = 1`, the output should be `2` (removing both `1` and `2`), but it would incorrectly output `2` based on its logic, not accounting for the need to produce a valid divisible number.
