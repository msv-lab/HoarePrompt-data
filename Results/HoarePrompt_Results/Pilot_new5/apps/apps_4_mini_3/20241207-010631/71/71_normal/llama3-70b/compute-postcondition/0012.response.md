In the initial state, `n` is 0. Since `n` is less than \(10^k\) for any positive integer \(k\), `w` is determined to be the number of digits in `n`, which is 1 (as `0` has 1 digit). 

The code provided simply prints the value of `w`. Printing does not change the value of any variables.

Therefore, the output state simply reflects the values of the variables without changes:

Output State: **`n` is 0, `w` is 1**
