Postcondition: ***`count_zeros` is equal to the number of '0's in `n` from the right until `k` is reached or the end of the string is reached, `to_remove` is equal to the number of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` zeros, `n` is the original string representation of the non-negative integer. The current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`.***
