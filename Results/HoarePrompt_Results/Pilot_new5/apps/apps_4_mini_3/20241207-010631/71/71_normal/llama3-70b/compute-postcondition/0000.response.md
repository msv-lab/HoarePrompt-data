The variables `n` and `k` are both assigned new values based on the output of the `input()` function, which accepts a pair of integers separated by a space. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts these inputs to integers. The specific values of `n` and `k` are not known, but the preconditions indicate that `n` must remain a non-negative integer within the specified range and `k` must remain a positive integer within its specified range. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000); `k` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9)**
