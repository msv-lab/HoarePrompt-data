The only code executed is `w += 1`, which increments the value of `w` by 1. The values of `n`, `n_original`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Given that:
- `n` is equal to `n_original / 100`
- `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`
- `k` is constrained such that `n % 10`

The output state reflects the increment of `w` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `n_original / 100`, `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`, `k` must be such that `n % 10`, `w` is increased by 1**
