The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or condition where we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `digit` is the next digit in `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
