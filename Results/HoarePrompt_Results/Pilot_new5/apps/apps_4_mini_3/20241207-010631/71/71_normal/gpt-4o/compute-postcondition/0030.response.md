Postcondition: ***`count_zeros` is the number of '0's in `n` from the right until `k` is reached or the end of the string is reached, `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` zeros, and `n` is the original string representation of the non-negative integer. If `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, then `to_remove` is printed. Otherwise, `len(n) - 1` has been printed, indicating that the output is `len(n) - 1`.***
