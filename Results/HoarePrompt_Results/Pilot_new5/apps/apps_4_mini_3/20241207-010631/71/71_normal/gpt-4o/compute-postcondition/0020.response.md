The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `digit`, and the unchanged `count_zeros` are not affected by this operation; however, `count_zeros` now reflects its previous value plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `digit` is the next digit in `n`, and `count_zeros` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `digit` is the next digit in `n`, `count_zeros` is incremented by 1.**
