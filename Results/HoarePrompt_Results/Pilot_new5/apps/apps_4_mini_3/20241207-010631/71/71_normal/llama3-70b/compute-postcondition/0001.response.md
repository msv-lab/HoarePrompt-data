The variable `w` is assigned the value `0`. The initial states of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000); `k` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9); `w` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000); `k` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9); `w` is 0**.
