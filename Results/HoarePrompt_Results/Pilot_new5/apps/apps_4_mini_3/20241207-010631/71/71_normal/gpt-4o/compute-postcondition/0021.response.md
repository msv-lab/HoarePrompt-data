The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `k`, `digit`, and `count_zeros` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `digit` is the next digit in `n`, `count_zeros` is unchanged, and `to_remove` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `digit` is the next digit in `n`, `count_zeros` is unchanged, `to_remove` is increased by 1**.
