Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, and `digit` is the next digit in `n` (from the end). If `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, the program continues execution without breaking.***
