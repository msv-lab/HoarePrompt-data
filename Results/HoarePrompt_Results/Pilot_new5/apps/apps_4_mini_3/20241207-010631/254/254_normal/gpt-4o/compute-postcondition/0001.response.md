The value of `gcd_k1_k2` is assigned the result of `math.gcd(k1, k2)`, which computes the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`. The values of `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged, and since `k1` and `k2` are integers within the range of 1 to 1500, the value of `gcd_k1_k2` will be an integer that reflects the greatest common divisor of those two values. Therefore, the Output State is: `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.**
