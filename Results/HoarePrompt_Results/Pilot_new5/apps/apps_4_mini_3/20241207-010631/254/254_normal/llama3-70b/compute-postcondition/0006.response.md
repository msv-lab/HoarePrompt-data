To analyze the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's review the structure of the loop and the changing values of the variables `a` and `b`.

The loop continues to execute as long as `b` is not equal to zero. Inside the loop:
1. The values of `a` and `b` are updated such that `a` takes the value of the current `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b` (the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`).

Let's summarize the transformations of the variables:

- **Initial State**: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers representing the time intervals of the garlands (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500).
  
- **Output State after loop executes 1 time**: After one iteration, `b` must have been initially greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Now, `a` is an integer, `b` is now `a % b`, and `c` is still an integer.
  
- **Output State after loop executes 2 times**: After the second iteration, if the loop executed again, `a` is now equal to the value of `b` from the previous iteration, and `b` is now equal to `a % b` from the previous iteration. Hence, `c` remains an integer. 

- **Output State after loop executes 3 times**: After three iterations, `a` is still equal to `b` from the second iteration, but `b` becomes 0, indicating that the loop will terminate. `c` remains an integer.

To determine the final state of the loop, we note that when the loop exits, `b` will be 0, and `a` will be the last non-zero value of `b` before it became 0. Since the original values of `a` and `b` were integers, the final relationship can be expressed.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `c` is an integer**
