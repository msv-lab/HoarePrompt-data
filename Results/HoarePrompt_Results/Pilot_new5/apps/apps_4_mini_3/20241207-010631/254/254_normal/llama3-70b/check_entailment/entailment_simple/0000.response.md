Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it relies on the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals of the garlands (k1, k2, k3) to determine if at least one garland will be lit during each second after they are switched on. However, the approach taken in the program does not guarantee that every second after the maximum of x1, x2, and x3 will have at least one garland lit.

Here's a specific case to illustrate the error: if k1 = 4, k2 = 2, and k3 = 3, the program calculates the LCM and checks if it is divisible by all three k values. The program will output "NO" because there is no moment of time that covers every second after the maximum of x1, x2, and x3. However, it is still possible that there are overlaps in the second intervals that allow for some coverage, which the program fails to account for. 

The correct approach should involve checking whether there exists a combination of x1, x2, and x3 such that every second after the maximum of these values has at least one garland lit, rather than solely relying on the divisibility of the LCM by k1, k2, and k3. 

Thus, the program does not accurately solve the problem as described and can lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
