Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. It effectively computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, where the process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the value of `a`, which will be the GCD. The function does not account for the case where both `a` and `b` are 0, as GCD is undefined in that scenario. **
