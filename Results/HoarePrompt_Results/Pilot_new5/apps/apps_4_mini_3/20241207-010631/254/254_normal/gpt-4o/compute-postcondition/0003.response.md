Postcondition: ***`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k_1` and `k_2`; `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k_3`. The current value of `gcd_all` is 1, indicating that `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are coprime.***
