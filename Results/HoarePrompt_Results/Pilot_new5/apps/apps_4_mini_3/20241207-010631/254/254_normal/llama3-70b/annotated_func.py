#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are integers representing the time intervals of three garlands, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `c` is an integer
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. It effectively computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, where the process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the value of `a`, which will be the GCD. The function does not account for the case where both `a` and `b` are 0, as GCD is undefined in that scenario.
