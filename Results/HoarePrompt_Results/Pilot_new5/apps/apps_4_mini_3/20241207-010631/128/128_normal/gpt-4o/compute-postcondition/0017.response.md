Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days`, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers representing products and clients for each day. It calculates the total sales by summing the minimum of products and clients for each day (regular sales) and adds the highest possible increase in sales from the first `f` days of potential sales increases. The function returns the total sales, which includes both regular sales and selected potential increases. The function does not handle cases where `f` is larger than the number of days available, as it simply takes the top `f` increases without checking bounds.**
