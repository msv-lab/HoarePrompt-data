Output State: **`sold` is the sum of `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` for `i` from `0` to `f-1` and `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for `i` from `f` to `n-1`; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `l - k`. The value of `sold` is printed.**
