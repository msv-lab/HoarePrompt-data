The values of `n` and `f` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The preconditions indicate that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000 and `f` is a non-negative integer that must not exceed `n`. After the execution of the code, `n` and `f` will hold the values input by the user, while the conditions on their valid ranges remain relevant.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`.**
