The `potential_sales_increase` list is updated by appending the value calculated from the expression `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`. The variables `k` and `l` are taken from the second tuple in the `days` list, and `potential_sales_increase` will now include this newly calculated value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a non-empty list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `k` is the first element of the second tuple in `days`, `l` is the second element of the second tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` now includes the value `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` appended, `regular_sales` includes `min(k, l)` appended.**
