The variable `days` is a tuple that initially contains values `(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are assigned input integers. However, since `days` is being modified by appending a new tuple `(k, l)`, it will now include the original tuple plus the newly appended tuple. The previous values of `n` and `f` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` now contains tuples including the original tuple `(k, l)` and the newly appended tuple `(k, l)`.**
