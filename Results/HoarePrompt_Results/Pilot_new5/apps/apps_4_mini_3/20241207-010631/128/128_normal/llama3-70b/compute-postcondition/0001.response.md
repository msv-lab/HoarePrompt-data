The variable `days` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `f` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`, `days` is an empty list.**
