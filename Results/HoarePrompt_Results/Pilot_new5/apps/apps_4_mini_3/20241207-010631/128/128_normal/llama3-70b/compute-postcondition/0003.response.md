The values of `k` and `l` are assigned by splitting the input and converting the resulting strings to integers using the `map` function. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `f` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n`, and `days` is an empty list. The values of `k` and `l` are unknown as they depend on user input, but they will be integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` is an empty list; `k` is an input integer; `l` is an input integer.**
