According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, the loop will execute exactly `n` times. The states `f` and `days` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but `days` being an empty list implies that there are no elements to process within the loop body if it relies on elements from `days`. However, this does not prevent the loop from executing.

For the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and in the first iteration (i.e., the first execution of the loop), the loop variable (which is unused in the loop body) is not defined, but we can denote it as `_`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`, `days` is an empty list, loop variable _ is unused**
