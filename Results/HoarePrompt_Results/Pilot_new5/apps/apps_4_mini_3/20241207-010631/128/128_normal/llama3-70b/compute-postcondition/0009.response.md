The variables `k` and `l` are assigned the values obtained from `input()` split into two integers. The previous values of `n` and `f` remain unchanged, but `k` and `l` are now defined based on the user's input. The specific values of `k` and `l` are not known until the input is provided, but they will be integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`, `k` is an integer from input, `l` is an integer from input.**
