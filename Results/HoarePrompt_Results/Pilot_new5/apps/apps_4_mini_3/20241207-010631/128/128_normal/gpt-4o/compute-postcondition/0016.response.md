The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). `f` is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n). `days` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i` (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for each of the `n` days. The function returns `total_sales`, which is the sum of the elements in `regular_sales` plus the sum of the first `f` elements from `potential_sales_increase`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a non-negative integer f, and a list of tuples days, and returns total_sales, which is the sum of regular_sales and the sum of the first f elements from potential_sales_increase.**
