The `days` list is sorted based on the difference between the second and first elements of each tuple `(k, l)`, in descending order. The original order of the `days` list is changed, but the values of `n` and `f` remain the same. The output state reflects the new order of the `days` tuples based on this sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `l - k` for each tuple.**
