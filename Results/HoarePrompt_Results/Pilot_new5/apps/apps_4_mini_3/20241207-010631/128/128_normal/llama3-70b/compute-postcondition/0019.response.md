Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`, `days` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `l - k`. If the current value of `i` is less than `f`, `sold` is set to the minimum of twice the first element of `days[0]` and the second element of `days[0]`. Otherwise, `sold` is set to the minimum of the first and second elements of `days[0]`, with `i` being greater than or equal to `f`.***
