According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the variable `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, we don't have the specific value of `j`, but it must be such that `j` is currently less than `d`. After incrementing `j`, it will be `j + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need `j + 1` to be less than `d`.

State: **`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, while `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged, `j` is `j + 1` and `d` must be greater than `j + 1`.**
