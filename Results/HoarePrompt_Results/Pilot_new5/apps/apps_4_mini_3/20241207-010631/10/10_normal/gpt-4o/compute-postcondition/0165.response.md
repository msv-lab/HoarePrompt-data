Output State: **`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` represent the counts of sofas as defined, and `target_sofa` is set to the index of the first sofa (1-based) that meets the conditions `left_count[i] == cnt_l`, `right_count[i] == cnt_r`, `top_count[i] == cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i] == cnt_b`, or remains -1 if no such sofa is found. `i` is equal to `d` after all iterations.**
