The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned values based on the input received from the user. The `map(int, input().strip().split())` function takes a single line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and unpacks the resulting values into `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The state of `sofas` remains as a list of tuples, and `d` must still be greater than 1.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1, x2, y2) are assigned values based on input.**
