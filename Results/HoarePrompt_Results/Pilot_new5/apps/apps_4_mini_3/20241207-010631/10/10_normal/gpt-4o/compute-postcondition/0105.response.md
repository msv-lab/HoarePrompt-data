Output State: **`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` represent the counts of sofas in respective positions relative to the sofa at index `i`, `j` is equal to `d`, and `sofas` has at least `d` elements. If `d` is 1, the loop does not execute, and the counts remain unchanged.**
