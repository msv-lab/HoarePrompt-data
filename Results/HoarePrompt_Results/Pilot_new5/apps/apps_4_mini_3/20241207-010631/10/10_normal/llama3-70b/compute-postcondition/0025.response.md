Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000) and `sofas` is a list containing at least two tuples. If `s` is the next tuple in the list and `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` while `sofa[0][0]` is equal to `s[0][0]`, then `top` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, and `bottom` is increased by 1. If the condition does not hold true, `top` is not increased and `right` remains unchanged, while `bottom` is unaffected.***
