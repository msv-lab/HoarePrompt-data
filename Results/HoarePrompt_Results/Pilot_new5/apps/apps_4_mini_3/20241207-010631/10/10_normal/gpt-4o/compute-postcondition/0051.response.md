Postcondition: ***`y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, `y2_j` maintain their respective values, `d` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` maintain their respective values from `sofas[0]`. If `i` is equal to `j`, the loop continues; otherwise, there is no else part.***
