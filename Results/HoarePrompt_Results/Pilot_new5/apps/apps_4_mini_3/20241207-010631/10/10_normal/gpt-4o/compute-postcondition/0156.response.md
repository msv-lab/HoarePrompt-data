Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` represent the counts of sofas as defined, with `target_sofa` set to 1 if the conditions `left_count[i] == cnt_l`, `right_count[i] == cnt_r`, `top_count[i] == cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i] == cnt_b` are satisfied and we break out of the loop, otherwise `target_sofa` remains -1.***
