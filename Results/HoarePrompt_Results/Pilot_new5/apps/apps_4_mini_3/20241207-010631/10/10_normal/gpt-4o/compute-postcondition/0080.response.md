Postcondition: ***If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1 and `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, while `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. If `y1` is not greater than `y2_j` or `y2` is not greater than `y2_j`, then `bottom_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
