#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), and sofas is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of each sofa (1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m) and the last element is a tuple of four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ sofa - 1.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` represent the counts of sofas relative to the position of `sofa` based on their coordinates, `sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing tuples with coordinates and counts, and if the loop does not execute, all counts remain 0.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the counts of sofas: left, right, top, and bottom, which are all 0 if the loop does not execute.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `sofa` representing a specific sofa and a list of tuples `sofas` where each tuple contains coordinates and additional counts. It calculates and returns counts of how many sofas are positioned to the left, right, above, and below the specified `sofa`. If there are no other sofas to compare against, the function returns (0, 0, 0, 0) indicating no counts. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to the input values beyond the specified ranges.
