Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least two tuples, and `s` is the next tuple in the list. If `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` is equal to `s[0][0]`, then `top` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, and `bottom` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `top` is not increased, and `right` remains unchanged.***
