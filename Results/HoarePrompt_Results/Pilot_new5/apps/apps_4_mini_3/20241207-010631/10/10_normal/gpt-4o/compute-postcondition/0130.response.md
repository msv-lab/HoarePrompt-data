Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged; `i` and `j` are unchanged; `d` is still greater than `j + 1`; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.***
