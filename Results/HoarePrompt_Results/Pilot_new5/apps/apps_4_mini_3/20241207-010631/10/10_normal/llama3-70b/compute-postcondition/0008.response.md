Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `left` is 1, `right` is now 1 if the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofas` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, while `top` remains 0, and `bottom` remains 0. If the conditions are not met, the state remains unchanged with `right` still equal to 0.***
