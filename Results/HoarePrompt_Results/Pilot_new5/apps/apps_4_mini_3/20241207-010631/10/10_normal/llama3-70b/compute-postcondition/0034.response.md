Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ `sofa` ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least `i + 2` tuples, and `s` is the tuple at index `i + 1`. If `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` is equal to `s[0][0]`, then `bottom` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged.***
