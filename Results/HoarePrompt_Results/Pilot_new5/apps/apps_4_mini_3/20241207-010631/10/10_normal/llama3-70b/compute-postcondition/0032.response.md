Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ `sofa` ≤ 100000), `sofas` is a list containing at least `i + 2` tuples, and `s` is the tuple at index `i + 1`. If `sofa[0][1] < s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]`, then `top` is increased by 1 and `right` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, and `right` also remains unchanged.***
