To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program's functionality step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of sofas (`d`), the dimensions of the storehouse (`n`, `m`), and the coordinates of each sofa. It also reads the counts of sofas around Grandpa Maks's sofa (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).

2. **Sofa Representation**: Each sofa is represented as a tuple of coordinates `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, which is correctly stored in a list for further processing.

3. **Counting Surrounding Sofas**: The program uses two nested loops to compare each sofa's position with every other sofa (excluding itself) to count how many sofas are to the left, right, above, and below the current sofa:
   - **Right Count**: It checks if the current sofa is entirely to the left of another sofa.
   - **Left Count**: It checks if the current sofa is entirely to the right of another sofa.
   - **Bottom Count**: It checks if the current sofa is entirely above another sofa.
   - **Top Count**: It checks if the current sofa is entirely below another sofa.
   
   The logic used in these comparisons is correct according to the problem description.

4. **Finding the Target Sofa**: After populating the counts for each sofa, the program looks for the first sofa that matches the specified counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). It correctly sets `target_sofa` to the index of this sofa (1-based) or -1 if no such sofa is found.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the index of the target sofa, aligning with the requirement to output -1 when no match is found.

### Conclusion
The program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the number of sofas in relation to each other and matches these counts against the input conditions provided. The comparisons are made based on the positions of the sofas, ensuring that they follow the rules outlined in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program adheres to all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
