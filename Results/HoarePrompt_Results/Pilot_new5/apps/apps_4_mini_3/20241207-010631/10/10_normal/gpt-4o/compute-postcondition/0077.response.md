Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `d`, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is assigned `sofas[0][0]`, `y1_j` is assigned `sofas[0][1]`, `x2_j` is assigned `sofas[0][2]`, `y2_j` is assigned `sofas[0][3]`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and the values of `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged, and the values of `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` also remain unchanged.***
