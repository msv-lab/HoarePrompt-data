Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to determine the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa based on the problem description. Here's why it fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Counting Conditions**: The conditions to count sofas based on their relative positions (left, right, top, bottom) are incorrectly implemented. The conditions within the nested loops are not properly accounting for neighboring sofas as defined in the problem statement. For example:
   - The condition `if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j:` only counts sofas to the right if both parts of the sofa are to the left of the other sofa, failing to account for cases where only one part might be to the left.
   - Similarly, `if x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j:` is only checking if the current sofa is completely to the left of another sofa, which does not account for them being adjacent.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The algorithm does not handle cases where two sofas might be adjacent or overlapping in terms of their coordinates correctly. The problem description states that two neighboring cells form a sofa, and the algorithm doesn't verify whether the sofas are positioned correctly according to the specifications.

3. **Output Logic**: The program assumes the first matching sofa is the correct one but does not account for the possibility of having an invalid configuration where no sofa meets the specified counts.

4. **Inefficiency**: The algorithm uses a nested loop, resulting in a time complexity of O(d^2), which may not perform efficiently for larger values of d (up to 10^5). There's no optimization in the counting process which would be crucial for performance.

In summary, the program fails to correctly identify the sofa by not accurately counting the neighboring sofas according to the specified conditions in the problem description. Therefore, it does not implement the functionality as required.
