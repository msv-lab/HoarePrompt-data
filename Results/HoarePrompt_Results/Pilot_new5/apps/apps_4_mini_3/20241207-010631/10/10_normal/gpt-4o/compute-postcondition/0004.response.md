The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned values from the input which are processed by the `map(int, input().strip().split())` function. This means `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will hold integer values that are input by the user, but their specific values are not known from the initial state. The other variables `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is an empty list, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is an empty list, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers.**
