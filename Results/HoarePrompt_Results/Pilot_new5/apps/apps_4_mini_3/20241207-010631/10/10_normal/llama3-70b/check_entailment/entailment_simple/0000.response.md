Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem description for determining the count of sofas relative to a given sofa. The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of sofas that are positioned to the left, right, top, and bottom of the specified sofa. However, the logic used to determine these counts is incorrect.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: 
   - The comparisons made in `func_1` only consider the first coordinate of the sofa (`sofa[0]`), while they should be checking the coordinates of both cells of the sofa (i.e., the two pairs of coordinates defined by `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`).
   - Additionally, when determining the relative position of sofas, the program should consider whether each cell of the current sofa is horizontally or vertically adjacent to the other sofa, which is not the case here.

2. **Missing Condition to Capture All Possible Cases**: 
   - The program fails to properly check which cell of the current sofa is adjacent to which cell of other sofas, as it only compares the coordinates of one cell from `sofa` with one cell from `s`. This does not accurately capture the relationship between the sofas.

3. **Return of Counts Without Validation**: 
   - Even if the counts are calculated incorrectly, the program still proceeds to check against the counts provided in the input without handling potential invalid cases where the counting logic is flawed.

### Example Failure Case:
If we look at the provided examples, consider the case where the sofas are positioned in such a way that the conditions are not met as the program currently stands. The logic would not accurately count the sofas due to the flawed comparisons and would potentially return an incorrect sofa index or incorrectly state that no sofa meets the conditions.

In summary, while the structure of the program is on the right track, the implementation of the counting logic is fundamentally flawed, leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
