Since `i` equals `j`, the program skips the assignment operation `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]`, and thus the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged. The other variables (`d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) also remain unchanged since nothing else has altered their values.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]**
