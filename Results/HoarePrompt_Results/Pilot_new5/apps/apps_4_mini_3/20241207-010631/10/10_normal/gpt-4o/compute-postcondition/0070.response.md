In the given scenario, the variable `right_count` at index `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `i` is equal to `d`, and `d` is greater than 0. Therefore, `i` is also greater than 0. The specific value of `right_count[i]` will be increased by 1, but the previous value of `right_count[i]` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `d`, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is assigned `sofas[0][0]`, `y1_j` is assigned `sofas[0][1]`, `x2_j` is assigned `sofas[0][2]`, `y2_j` is assigned `sofas[0][3]`, and `x1`, `x2` are both less than `x1_j`; `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
