Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are all assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, and the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j`.***
