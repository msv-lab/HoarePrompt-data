Postcondition: ***`y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, `y2_j` maintain their respective values; `d` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`; if `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1 and `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1.***
