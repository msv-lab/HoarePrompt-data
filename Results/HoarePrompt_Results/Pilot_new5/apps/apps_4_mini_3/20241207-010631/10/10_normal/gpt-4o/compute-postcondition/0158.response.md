The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is equal to `d`. Therefore, `target_sofa` becomes `d + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` represent the counts of sofas as defined; `target_sofa` is `d + 1`; `i` is `d`.**
