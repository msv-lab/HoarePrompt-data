The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `right_count[i]` is unchanged, `left_count[i]` is unchanged, `bottom_count[i]` is unchanged, `top_count[i]` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `sofas` has at least `d` elements, `i` is `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the respective values from `sofas[d]`, `d` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `j` (which is 0) and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`right_count[i]` is unchanged, `left_count[i]` is unchanged, `bottom_count[i]` is unchanged, `top_count[i]` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `sofas` has at least `d` elements, `i` is `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the respective values from `sofas[d]`, `d` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `j` (which is 0) and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
