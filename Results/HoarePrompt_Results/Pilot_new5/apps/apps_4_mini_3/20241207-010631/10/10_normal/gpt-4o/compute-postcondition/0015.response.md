The variable `right_count` is initialized as a list containing `d` zeros. The previous conditions are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of the form (x1, y1, x2, y2), where each tuple corresponds to the input integers provided during each iteration of the loop; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of `d` integers, all set to 0, `right_count` is a list of `d` integers, all set to 0.`**
