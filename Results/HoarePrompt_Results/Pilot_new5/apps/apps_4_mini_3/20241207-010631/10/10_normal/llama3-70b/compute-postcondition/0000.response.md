Output State: **`sofa` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000); `sofas` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of each sofa (1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m) and the last element is a tuple of four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ sofa - 1; `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.**
