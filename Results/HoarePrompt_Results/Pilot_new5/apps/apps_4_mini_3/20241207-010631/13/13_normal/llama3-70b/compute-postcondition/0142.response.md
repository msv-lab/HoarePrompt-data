According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i` and the range defined in the loop. The loop starts from `i + 2` and goes up to `n`, so the minimum value for `j` will be `5` (since `i` is `3`).

To ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be at least `5` because if `n` is less than `5`, the range will be empty (since `j` starts from `5` and goes up to `n`).

Given that `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring, it can remain unchanged for the execution of the loop. However, it is important to note that if `n` is exactly `5`, the loop will only execute once with `j` being `5`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are as follows:
- `n` must be at least `5` to allow the loop to execute.
- `j` should start at `5` for the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least 5, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]`**
