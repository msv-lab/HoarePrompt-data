According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and the range from 0 to `n-1`. If `right` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is currently at 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The constraints on `n` also remain the same as `n` is still between 2 and 100000. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `left` is less than `right`, `left` is 0, `right` is 1**
