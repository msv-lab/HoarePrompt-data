Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `j` is the first index after the last 'G' encountered or `n`, `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `s[i + 2]` plus the initial `beauty` value based on `s[0:i]`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.***
