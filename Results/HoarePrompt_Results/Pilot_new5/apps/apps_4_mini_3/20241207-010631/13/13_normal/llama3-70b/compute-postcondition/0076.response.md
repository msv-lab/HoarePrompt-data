The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `s[j]` is 'G', it implies that the current count of 'G's in `beauty` is being increased. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `beauty` is the count of 'G's found from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]`, plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `beauty` is the count of 'G's found from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]` plus 1.**
