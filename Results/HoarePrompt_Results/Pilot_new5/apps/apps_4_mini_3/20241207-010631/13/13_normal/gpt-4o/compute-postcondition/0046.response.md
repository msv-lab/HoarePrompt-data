The variable `max_length` is assigned the maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters found in the `segments`, calculated as `end - start + 1` for each tuple in `segments`. Since `segments` is not empty, `max_length` will hold the value of the longest sequence of 'G's. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of all consecutive 'G' characters in the `trophies` string, `max_length` is equal to the maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters in `segments`.**
