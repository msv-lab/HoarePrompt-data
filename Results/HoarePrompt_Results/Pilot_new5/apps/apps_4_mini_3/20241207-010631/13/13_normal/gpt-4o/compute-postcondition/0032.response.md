The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since it was stated that `n` must be greater than `i`, the relationship between `n` and `i` remains valid after this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`; `trophies[i]` must be 'G'; `trophies` remains unchanged; `segments` as previously stated; `start` is equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
