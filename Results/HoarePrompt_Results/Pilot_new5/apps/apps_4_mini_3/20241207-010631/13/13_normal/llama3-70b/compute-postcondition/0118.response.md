According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `i` is 2. The next value of `j` will be `j + 1`, which means `j` will be 6 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than 6.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and must be greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
