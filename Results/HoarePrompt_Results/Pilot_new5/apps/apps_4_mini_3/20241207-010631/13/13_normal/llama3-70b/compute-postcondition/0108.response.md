According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends primarily on the variable `i` and the current value of `j` in relation to `n`. 

1. The loop starts with `j` taking values starting from `i + 2`, which, given that `i` is 2, means it will start from `4`.
2. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `n` can be at most 100000, `j` should be at least `4` and at most `99999` (if `n` is 100000).
3. Currently, `j` is initialized at `-1`, which means it needs to be adjusted to start at `4` for the loop to execute.
4. Finally, since `beauty` is calculated based on the substring `s[0:i]`, there isn't a requirement to adjust `beauty` for the loop execution, but we note its current value.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `j` to start at `4`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters at the end of the substring `s[0:i]`**.
