According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 4. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 4. To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `beauty` is the count of 'G's found from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]`**
