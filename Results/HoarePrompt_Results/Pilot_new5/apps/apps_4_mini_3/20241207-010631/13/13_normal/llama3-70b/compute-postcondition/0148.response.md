To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information.

1. **Initial Variables**: We have `n` which is at least 5, `i` which is 3, and `j` which is 5 at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **For Loop Conditions**: The loop is structured as `for j in range(i + 2, n)`. Since `i` is 3, the start of the range for `j` is `i + 2`, which equals `5`. The end of the range is `n`.

3. **Current State**: At present, `j` is 5. The loop is designed to iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

4. **Next Iteration**: To determine the state for the next iteration:
    - Since `j` is currently 5, it will increment by 1 in the next iteration. So, for the next iteration, `j` would become `6`.
    - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j`. Since we currently have `j` as 5, `n` must be greater than 6.

Therefore, we conclude the new state at the beginning of the next iteration:

State: **`n` must be greater than 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 6**
