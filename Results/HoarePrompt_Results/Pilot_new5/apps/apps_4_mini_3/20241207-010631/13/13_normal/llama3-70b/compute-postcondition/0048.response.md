Output State: **`left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in the string `s`, `right` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` or greater, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, if there are no 'G's in `s`, then `left` will equal `right` and the loop will not execute, resulting in the original values of `left` and `right`.**
