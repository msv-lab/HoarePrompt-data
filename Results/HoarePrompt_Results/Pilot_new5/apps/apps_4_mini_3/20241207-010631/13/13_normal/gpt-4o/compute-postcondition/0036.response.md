The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, which remains valid after the increment. The value of `i` changes to its previous value plus 1, and the rest of the variables stay unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `trophies[i]` must be 'G'; `trophies` remains unchanged; `segments` as previously stated; `start` is equal to the previous value of `i`; `i` is now equal to the previous value of `i + 1.**
