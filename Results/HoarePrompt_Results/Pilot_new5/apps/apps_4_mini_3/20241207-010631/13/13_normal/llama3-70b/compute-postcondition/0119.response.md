The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The states of the variables are as follows: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and must be greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, and `beauty` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and must be greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
