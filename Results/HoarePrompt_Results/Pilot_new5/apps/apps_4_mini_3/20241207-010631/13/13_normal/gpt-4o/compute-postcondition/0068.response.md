The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer constrained to the range 2 to 100000, and `trophies`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. 

After executing the function body, the behavior of the function is as follows:

- **Case 1**: If there are no 'G' characters in the string `trophies`, the function returns 0.
- **Case 2**: If there is exactly one segment of consecutive 'G' characters, the function returns the maximum length of that segment.
- **Case 3**: If there are multiple segments of consecutive 'G' characters, the function returns the minimum of (maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters + 1) and `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and return a value based on the presence and configuration of 'G' characters in the string. Specifically, it returns 0 if there are no 'G' characters, the length of the segment if there's one, or a calculated value based on the maximum length of segments if there are multiple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 2 and 100000) and trophies (a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S'), returning 0 if there are no 'G' characters, the length of the segment if there's one segment of 'G', or the minimum of (maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters + 1) and n if there are multiple segments.**
