According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The `range` function is defined as `range(i - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it starts at `i - 1` and decrements until it is greater than -1. 

In this case, since `i` is 2, the starting point of the range would be `i - 1`, which is 1. The loop will execute for values 1 down to 0 (inclusive) since the end point is -1, which is not included. 

At the start of the loop, `j` would take on the value 1 first, and on the next iteration, it would take on the value 0. 

To summarize:
- `i` needs to be at least 2 (which it is).
- The initial value of `j` will be 1 when the loop begins.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `beauty` is 1, `j` is 1**
