The code `segments.append((start, i - 1))` appends a tuple to the `segments` list, where the tuple consists of `start` and `i - 1`. The variable `start` is currently 1, and `i` is the index of the first character in `trophies` that is not 'G'. 

Since `i` is the index of the first character that is not 'G', if `i` is equal to `n`, it means that all characters from position 1 to `n-1` are 'G'. In that case, `i` would be equal to `n`, and `i - 1` would be `n - 1`.

Given that `segments` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, it will contain the tuple `(1, i - 1)`.

So, the output state after executing the code would reflect that the `segments` list now has one entry, and `start` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the index of the first character in `trophies` that is not 'G', `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` is now [(1, i - 1)], `start` is 1.**
