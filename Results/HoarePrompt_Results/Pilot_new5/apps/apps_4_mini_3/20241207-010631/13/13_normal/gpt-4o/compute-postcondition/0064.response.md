The variable `max_length` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and a calculated expression. The expression involves `curr_end`, `curr_start`, `prev_end`, and `prev_start`. We can express the calculation as follows:

1. `curr_end - curr_start + 1` gives the length of the current segment.
2. `prev_end - prev_start + 1` gives the length of the previous segment.
3. The additional `1` accounts for the separation between the current and previous segments.

Therefore, the new value assigned to `max_length` will be the maximum of its previous value and the total length calculated from the segments.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `segments`, `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, `curr_end`) are not directly affected, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`, and `max_length` is updated to `max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)`.**
