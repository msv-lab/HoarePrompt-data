The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The requirement that `n` must be greater than `i` remains unchanged. However, since `i` is now one greater than its previous value, `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`. The condition that `trophies[i]` must be 'G' is also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `trophies[i]` must still be 'G'.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `trophies[i]` must be 'G'**
