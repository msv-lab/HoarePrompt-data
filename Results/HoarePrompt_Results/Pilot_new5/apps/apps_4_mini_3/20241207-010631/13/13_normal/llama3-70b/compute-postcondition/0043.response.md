The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The preconditions state that `left` must be less than 2, and after this operation, `left` will be either 1 or 2, but since it must be less than 2, `left` must now be 1. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `right` is 2.**
