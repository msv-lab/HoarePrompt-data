According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the current value of `j` and the starting point defined by `i`. The loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is `i - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to `i - 3` (the next value in the iteration). 

The values of `n`, `beauty`, and `s[j]` do not change for the next iteration of the loop in this context, but we note that the loop must still respect its bounds, meaning `j` must remain non-negative. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be at least `0`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, we require that `i` must be greater than or equal to 3 (since `j` is calculated as `i - 2`, and for `j` to be `i - 3`, `i` must be 3 or more).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `beauty` is either 1, 2, or 3, `j` is `i - 3`, `i` must be greater than or equal to 3**
