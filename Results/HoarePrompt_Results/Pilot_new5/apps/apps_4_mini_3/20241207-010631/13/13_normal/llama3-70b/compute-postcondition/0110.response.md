The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1, which means its value increases by 1. The conditions for `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The character at index `j` of the string `s` is 'G', which is relevant for determining the value of `beauty`. Therefore, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters at the end of the substring `s[0:i]` plus 1.**
