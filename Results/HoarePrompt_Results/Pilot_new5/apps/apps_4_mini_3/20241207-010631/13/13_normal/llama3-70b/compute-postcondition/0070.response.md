The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `s[0]`, and `j` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the change in the variable `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `s[0]` must exist and be checked, `j` is -1, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
