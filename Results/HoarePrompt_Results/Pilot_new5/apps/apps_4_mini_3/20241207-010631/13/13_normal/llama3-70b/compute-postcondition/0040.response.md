The variable `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`. The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, thus `curr_beauty` is now 1 greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `left`, `right`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `right` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `right` is 2.**
