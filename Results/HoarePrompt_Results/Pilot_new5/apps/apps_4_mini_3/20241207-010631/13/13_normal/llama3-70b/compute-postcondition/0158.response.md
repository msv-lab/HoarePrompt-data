Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `i` is 3. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is at least 5, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]` plus the count of consecutive 'G's found from `s[5]` until a non-'G' character is encountered, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.***
