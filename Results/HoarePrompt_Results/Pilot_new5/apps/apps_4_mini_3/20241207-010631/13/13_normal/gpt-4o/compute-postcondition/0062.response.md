`prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values from `segments[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, this means `i - 1` is 2. Therefore, `prev_start` will be assigned the value `segments[2][0]` and `prev_end` will be assigned the value `segments[2][1]`. The values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` remain unchanged, as do the values of `i` and the structure of `segments`. 

Output State: **`i` is 3, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`**
