The code updates the variable `max_beauty` to be the greater value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since `max_beauty` is initialized to 0 and we do not have information on the value of `curr_beauty`, the output state reflects that `max_beauty` will be either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the character at index `right` in `s` is 'S'.**
