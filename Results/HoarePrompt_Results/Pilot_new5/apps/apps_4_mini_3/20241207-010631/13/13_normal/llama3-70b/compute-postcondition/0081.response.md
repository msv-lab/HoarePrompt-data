The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` is the count of 'G's found from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]`, the new value of `beauty` will be the previous count plus one. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `beauty` is the previous count of 'G's plus 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `beauty` is the previous count of 'G's plus 1**.
