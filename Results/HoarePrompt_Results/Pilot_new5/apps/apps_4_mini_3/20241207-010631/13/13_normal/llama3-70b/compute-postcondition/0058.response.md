The variable `beauty` is assigned the value `1`, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state will reflect this change while retaining the previous values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is 'G', the current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 1**
