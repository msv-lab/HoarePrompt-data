The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` still holds, and since `trophies[i]` must be 'G', it is unchanged. The other variables `trophies` and `segments` also remain unchanged. The value of `start` continues to be equal to the previous value of `i`, and now `i` is equal to `i + 1`. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `trophies[i]` must be 'G'; `trophies` remains unchanged; `segments` as previously stated; `start` is equal to the previous value of `i`; `i` is now equal to the previous value of `i + 1**.
