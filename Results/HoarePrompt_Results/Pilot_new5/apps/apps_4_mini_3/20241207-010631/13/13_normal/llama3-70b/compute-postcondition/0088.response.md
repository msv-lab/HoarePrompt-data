Given the analysis of the loop and the provided output states, the loop will continue executing as long as there are consecutive 'G's in the string `s` starting from the position `i + 2` (which is at least `j = 3` for the first iteration) until a character that is not 'G' is encountered or until `n` is reached.

To summarize the expected output state after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is in the range of 2 to 100000.
- The variable `i` also remains unchanged and is equal to 1.
- The variable `j` will take the value of the first index after the last 'G' found in the sequence starting from `i + 2` until a non-'G' character is encountered or until reaching `n`.
- The variable `beauty` will be equal to the total count of 'G's encountered in the string `s` from the index `i + 2` until the first non-'G' character.

Thus, the final output state after the loop execution is:

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 to 100000, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the first non-'G' character after `i + 1` or `n`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in `s` from `s[i+2]` to the last 'G' before the first non-'G' character or until `n`.**
