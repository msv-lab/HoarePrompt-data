The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `beauty`, so we cannot specify the exact outcome of that variable. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, and `beauty` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, and `beauty` has been increased by 1.**
