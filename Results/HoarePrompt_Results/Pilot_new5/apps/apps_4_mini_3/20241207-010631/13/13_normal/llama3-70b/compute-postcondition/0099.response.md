According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop is set to iterate from `i - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, which means the loop has executed for `j = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, making `j` equal to 0. 

Since the loop starts at `i - 1` and goes down to `0`, to continue executing, `j` must be 0 in the next iteration. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `beauty` remains 1 or is updated to 2 depending on the character at index `j` in string `s`.**
