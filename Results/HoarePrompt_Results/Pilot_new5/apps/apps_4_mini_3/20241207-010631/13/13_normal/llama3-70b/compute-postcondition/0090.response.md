Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `j` is the index of the first non-'G' character after `i + 1` or `n`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in `s` from `s[i+2]` to the last 'G' before the first non-'G' character or until `n`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
