The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `right` if there are no 'G's before `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is now incremented by 1.
