The value of `curr_start` is assigned the value of `segments[i][0]` and the value of `curr_end` is assigned the value of `segments[i][1]`. Given that `i` is currently 2, `curr_start` becomes `segments[2][0]` and `curr_end` becomes `segments[2][1]`. The values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `segments` has at least 3 elements, `prev_start` is `segments[1][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[1][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[2][1]`**
