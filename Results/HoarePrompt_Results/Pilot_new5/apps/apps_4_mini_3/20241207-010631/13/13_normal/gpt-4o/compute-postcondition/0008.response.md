The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so after the execution of the code, `i` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` and trophies[1] must be 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 0, and the first character of `trophies` is 'G'.**
