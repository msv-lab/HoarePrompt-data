The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is 3, so the new value becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `left` is 4, `right` is 4.
