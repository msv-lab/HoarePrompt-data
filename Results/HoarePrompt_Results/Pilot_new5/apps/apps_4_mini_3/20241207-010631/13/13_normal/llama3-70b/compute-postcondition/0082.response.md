The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The initial state of the variables remains intact, and there are no changes to `n`, `i`, `j`, or `beauty`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
