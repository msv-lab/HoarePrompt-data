According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop starts from `i - 1` and continues until it reaches -1. Given that `i` is currently 1, the starting value of `j` for the next iteration would be `1 - 1`, which is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented from its current value (which is 0) to -1. This means the loop can execute again as long as `j` is not less than 0. 

Since `s[j]` must be checked, and we already know that `j` is 0, the loop would check `s[0]` on the next iteration. 

To summarize, `j` will be 0 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute one more time holds true because `j` will be decremented to -1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `s[0]` must exist and be checked, and `j` is -1.**
