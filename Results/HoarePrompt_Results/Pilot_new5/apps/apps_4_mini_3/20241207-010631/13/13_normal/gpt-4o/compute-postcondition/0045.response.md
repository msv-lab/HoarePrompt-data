Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of all consecutive 'G' characters in the `trophies` string, and `segments` is not an empty list. If there are 'G' characters, `trophies` remains unchanged. The original value of `n` was in the range 2 to 100000.***
