The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. The variable `b` remains unchanged, and `years` is still 0. Since `a` is an integer from input with a range of 1 to 10, after the operation, `a` will take values between 3 and 30 (inclusive), depending on its initial value. Thus, we can represent `a` in terms of its original value, denoting it as `a = orig_a`, where `orig_a` is the input integer from the range [1, 10].

Output State: **`b` is an integer from input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, `years` is 0, and `a` is equal to `orig_a * 3 (where orig_a is the original value of a between 1 and 10, making a between 3 and 30).**
