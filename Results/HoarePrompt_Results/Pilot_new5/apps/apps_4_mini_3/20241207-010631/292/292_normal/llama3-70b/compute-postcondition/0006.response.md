According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 3` and `b` is now equal to `b * 2`, where \(2 \leq b \leq 20\).

Since `b` is multiplied by 2, it is guaranteed that `b` is at least 4 (because the minimum value of `b` is 2), and at most 40 (but the upper limit of the loop condition depends on the value of `a`). For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `orig_a * 3` is less than or equal to the new value of `b`.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state so that `orig_a * 3` is less than or equal to `b * 2`. This means that we need to state that `orig_a` must be less than or equal to \( \frac{b \times 2}{3} \).

State: **`years` is 1, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 3`, `b` is now equal to `b * 2`, and `orig_a` must be less than or equal to \(\frac{b \times 2}{3}\)**.
