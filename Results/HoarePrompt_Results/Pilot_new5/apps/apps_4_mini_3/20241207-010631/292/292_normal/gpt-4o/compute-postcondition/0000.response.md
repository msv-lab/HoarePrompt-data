In the provided code, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the user's input, which consists of two integers. The code uses `map(int, input().split())` to convert the input values into integers and assign them to `a` and `b` respectively. The precondition states that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, indicating that `a` can take any integer value from 1 to 10 and `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` but also not greater than 10.

Since the initial state specifies the range of possible values for `a` and `b`, the output state should reflect that `a` and `b` are now determined by the input, without changing the conditions on their values. However, we cannot specify their exact values as they depend on user input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, inclusive.**
