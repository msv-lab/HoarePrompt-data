Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine how many years it will take for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob respectively, ensuring that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. This satisfies the input constraints outlined in the problem description.

2. **Weight Growth Logic**:  
   - Limak's weight triples each year (`a *= 3`).
   - Bob's weight doubles each year (`b *= 2`).
   This matches the problem requirement that Limak's weight increases at a rate of three times per year while Bob's weight increases at two times per year.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues while Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`while a <= b:`), which is the correct stopping condition for determining when Limak's weight will exceed Bob's.

4. **Counting Years**: The program maintains a counter `years`, incrementing it with each iteration of the loop. This accurately tracks the number of years it takes until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `years`, which corresponds to the required output of the number of full years after which Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's.

Each aspect of the program adheres to the problem description and handles all potential edge cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified.
