The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly but operates on the constraints provided, where `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, representing the weights of Limak and Bob respectively. Based on the weights, the function determines the winner of a game between Limak and Bob. 

If the weights are such that Limak's weight is less than Bob's (a < b), Limak wins. If Limak's weight is equal to Bob's (a = b), Bob wins. In the case of Limak winning, the function returns "Limak", and in the case of Bob winning, it returns "Bob". 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine the winner based on the weights of Limak and Bob while adhering to the constraints of weight values.

Functionality: **The function determines the winner between Limak and Bob based on their weights, returning "Limak" if Limak wins (a < b) and "Bob" if Bob wins (a = b).**
