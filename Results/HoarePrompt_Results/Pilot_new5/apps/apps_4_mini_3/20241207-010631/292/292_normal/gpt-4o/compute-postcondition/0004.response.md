The variable `b` is multiplied by 2. The initial state indicates that `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, inclusive. Since `a` is between 3 and 30, `b` could be any integer from `a` (which can be 3 at minimum) to 10 at maximum. Therefore, the new value of `b` will be double its original value, which could range from 6 (if `b` was 3) to 20 (if `b` was 10), but will still depend on the original value of `b`.

The variable `years` remains unchanged, still being 0.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 30, `b` is an integer between `2a` and 20, inclusive, `years` is 0**.
