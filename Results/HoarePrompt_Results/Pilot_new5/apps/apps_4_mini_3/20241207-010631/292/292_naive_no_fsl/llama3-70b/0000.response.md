Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It starts with the weights of Limak and Bob and applies the transformations specified: Limak's weight is tripled each year while Bob's weight is doubled. The program uses a while loop to continue this process until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. The number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob is accurately counted and printed.

The logic follows these steps:
1. Read the weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`) from the input.
2. Initialize a counter for years.
3. Use a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.
4. Inside the loop, update Limak's weight by tripling it, and double Bob's weight.
5. Increment the years counter.
6. Once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, the loop exits, and the total years count is printed.

All provided examples confirm that the program produces the expected output for all scenarios given the constraints. Since no edge cases or incorrect behaviors can be identified, the program is correct for the problem description.
