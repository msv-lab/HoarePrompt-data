Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the edge case where Limak's weight is equal to Bob's weight at the start (the case being `1 1`). According to the problem description, it states that Limak will become larger than Bob after the first year. However, for the input `1 1`, the program will enter the while loop since `1 <= 1` holds true, and will perform the computations leading to weights `3` and `2` (after 1 year), which incorrectly counts 1 year but the expected answer should be `1`. 

Thus, the program does not correctly account for this edge case scenario where Limak and Bob start at equal weights but after the first year Limak becomes larger. 

Additionally, if we test it with the edge case input `1 1`, we see that it prints `1` as expected which seems correct, but we also need to consider if Limak will be strictly larger or not; if they start equal, Limak doesn't become strictly larger yet.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the logic for the edge case of equal weights.
