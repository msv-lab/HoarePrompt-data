Postcondition: ***`v` is a sorted list of `n` integers greater than 0, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `low` is either equal to `(0 + min(v) + 1) // 2` if `total` is less than `s`, or 0 if `total` is greater than or equal to `s`. `high` is `min(v)` if `total` is less than `s`, or `(0 + min(v) + 1) // 2 - 1` if `total` is greater than or equal to `s`. `mid` remains `(0 + min(v) + 1) // 2` in both cases, and `total` is either less than `s` or greater than or equal to `s` depending on the execution path.***
