Postcondition: ***`v` is a sorted list of `n` integers greater than 0; `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12); if `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`, and `high` remains greater than `low`, with `mid` recalculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2` and `total` being the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`. Otherwise, `low` remains less than `high`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `total` remains the same, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.***
