Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, and `high` is less than `min(v)`. If the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`, then `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, `low` is the maximum value for which the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is less than or equal to `s`, `high` is equal to `low`, `total` is equal to the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`, and `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12).***
