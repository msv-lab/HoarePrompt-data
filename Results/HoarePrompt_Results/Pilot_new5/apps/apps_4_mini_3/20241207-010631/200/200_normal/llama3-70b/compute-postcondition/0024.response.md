Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `high` is less than `min(v)`, `total` is equal to the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12). If the loop executed, the original `low` was less than `min(v)`, and if the loop executed at least once, it indicates that the final value of `low` is the maximum value for which the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is less than `s`.**
