The variable `v` is assigned the value of a list created from the input integers, which are split by spaces and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The variable `n` indicates the length of this list, meaning `n` will now equal the number of integers inputted. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is now the count of integers inputted, and `s` remains an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12).

Output State: **`v` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is the count of integers from input, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12)**
