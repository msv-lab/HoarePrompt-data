The function accepts two positive integers `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the target amount of kvass), followed by a list `v` of positive integers representing the volumes of the kegs. It checks the total volume of the kegs; if the total is less than `s`, it prints `-1`. If sufficient kvass is available, it calculates the minimum keg volume that can be maintained after attempting to collect `s` amount of kvass from the kegs. If it cannot meet the `s` requirement, it adjusts the minimum keg volume accordingly and prints that value. If all the kvass is collected successfully, it prints the original minimum keg volume. The function handles edge cases where the total volume is less than `s` and when the remaining kvass is greater than zero after processing all kegs.
