Postcondition: ***`v` is a sorted list of `n` integers greater than 0, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), if `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`, `high` remains at least 2, `mid` is recalculated as (high + 1) // 2, and `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`. Otherwise, `low` remains 0, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as (high + 1) // 2, and `total` remains the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`.***
