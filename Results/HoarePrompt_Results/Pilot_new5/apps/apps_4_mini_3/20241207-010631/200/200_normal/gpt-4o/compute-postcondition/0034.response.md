Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range [1, 1000]; `s` is a positive integer in the range [1, 10^12]; `v` is a list of integers representing the keg volumes; `volumes` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`; `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed, which can be at most `n`. After all iterations, not enough kvass was collected from the available kegs.***
