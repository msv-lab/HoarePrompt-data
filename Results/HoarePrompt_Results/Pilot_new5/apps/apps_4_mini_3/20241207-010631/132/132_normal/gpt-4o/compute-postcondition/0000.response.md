The value of `n` is reassigned to the result of `int(input())`, which means `n` will now hold a new positive integer value within the range of 1 to 50 based on user input. The lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged since no operations are performed on them. 

Output State: **`x` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000, `y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and 50**.
