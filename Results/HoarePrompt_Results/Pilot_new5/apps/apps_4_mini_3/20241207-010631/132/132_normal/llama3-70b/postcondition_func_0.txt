The function accepts two lists of non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, which represent the number of stones in piles during two visits. It first checks if the total number of stones in both lists is equal; if not, it prints 'No'. If the totals are equal, it sorts both lists and checks if they are identical. If they are, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not explicitly take `n` as a parameter, and there is no validation for the input values beyond ensuring they are non-negative integers within specified bounds.
