The `sort()` method is called on the list `y`, which will rearrange its elements in ascending order. Given that `y` is derived from input and consists of non-negative integers within the specified range, after sorting, the order of the elements in `y` will be the same but arranged from the smallest to the largest. The variables `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `x` is a sorted list of integers from input; `y` is a sorted list of integers derived from input with each integer being a non-negative integer where each y[i] (0 <= y[i] <= 1000). The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
