The code calculates the sum of the integers in the list `x` and assigns that value to `total_x`. The variable `x` is derived from the input and contains integers, while `y` is a list of non-negative integers. The length of `y` is `n`, which is unaffected by the summation in this context.

- `total_x` is now assigned the value of `sum(x)`, which will be the total of all integers in the list `x`.
- The values of `y` and `n` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this summation.

Output State: **`y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000; `n` is the length of `y`; `x` is a list of integers derived from the input; `total_x` is the sum of integers in `x`.**
