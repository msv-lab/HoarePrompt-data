The value of `x` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which converts a space-separated input string of integers into a list of integers. The previous state of `y` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `x` as a list of integers based on the user input.

Output State: **`y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of integers derived from the input**.
