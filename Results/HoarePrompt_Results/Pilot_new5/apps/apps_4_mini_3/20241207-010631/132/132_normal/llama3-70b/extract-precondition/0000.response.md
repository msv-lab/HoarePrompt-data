Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), x is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer x[i] (0 <= x[i] <= 1000) represents the number of stones in the i-th pile during the first visit, and y is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer y[i] (0 <= y[i] <= 1000) represents the number of stones in the i-th pile during the second visit.**
