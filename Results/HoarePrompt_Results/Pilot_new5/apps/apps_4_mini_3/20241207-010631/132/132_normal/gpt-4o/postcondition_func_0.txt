The function reads an integer `n` from input, followed by two lists of `n` non-negative integers (`x` and `y`). It calculates the sums of these lists (`total_x` and `total_y`) and prints 'No' if the sum of `y` is greater than the sum of `x`; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it assumes valid input as specified in the comments.
