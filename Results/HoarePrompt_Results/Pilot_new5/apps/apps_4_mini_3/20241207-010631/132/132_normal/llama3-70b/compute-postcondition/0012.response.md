Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer; `x` is a sorted list of integers from input; `y` is a sorted list of non-negative integers derived from input (where each y[i] satisfies 0 <= y[i] <= 1000) and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, 'Yes' has been printed. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is 'No'.***
