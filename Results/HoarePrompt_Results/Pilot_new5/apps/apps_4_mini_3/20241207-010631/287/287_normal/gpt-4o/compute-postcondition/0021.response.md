The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 3, so after the execution of the code, `i` becomes 4. The conditions involving `num` and `count` aren't affected by this operation, so their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is at least 9, `i` is 4. 

Output State: **`num` is at least 9; `i` is 4**
