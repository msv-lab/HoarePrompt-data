To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we must analyze the condition within the `while` loop, which is `i * i <= num`.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `num` is an integer constrained between `1` and `10^9`.
   - `count` is currently `0`, which doesn't affect the loop's execution.
   - `i` is initially `1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop will execute if `i * i <= num`. If `i = 1`, then `1 * 1 = 1`. 
   - For the loop to execute, `num` must be at least `1` (which it is, given that `1 <= num`).

3. **Current Values**:
   - Since `i` is `1` and `num` is at least `1`, the condition `i * i <= num` holds true as `1 <= num`.

This means the loop can execute because the condition is satisfied. 

Therefore, the program state does not need to change to allow the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
