Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. If `i * i` equals `n`, then `res` is set to 2 if `n` is divisible by `i`; otherwise, `res` is set to 0. If `i * i` does not equal `n`, `res` maintains its previous value, which is 3 if `n` is divisible by `i`, otherwise it remains 1.***
