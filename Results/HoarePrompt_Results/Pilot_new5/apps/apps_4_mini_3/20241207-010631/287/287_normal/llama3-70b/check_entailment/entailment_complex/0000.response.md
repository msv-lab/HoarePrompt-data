The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the number of different weights of splits of an integer \( n \).
   - A split of \( n \) is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sums to \( n \).
   - The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function calculates and prints the total number of divisors of the integer \( n \).
   - It uses a loop to find divisors by checking for numbers that evenly divide \( n \).
   - The result `res` is incremented for each divisor found, and adjustments are made for perfect squares.

3. **Mismatch with Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem does not ask for divisors of \( n \); rather, it asks for the count of different weights of possible splits of \( n \).
   - The output produced by the program (the number of divisors) does not relate to the concept of splits and their weights as described in the problem statement.
   - Therefore, the function does not solve the problem as required.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not align with the specified functionality of calculating the number of different weights of splits of \( n \), it is incorrect.
