`res` is assigned the value of its previous value plus 2. The value of `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `res` has increased by 2 from its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is increased by 2 from its previous value.**
