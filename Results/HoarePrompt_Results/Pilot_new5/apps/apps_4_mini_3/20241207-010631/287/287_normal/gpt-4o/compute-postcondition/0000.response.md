The variable `count` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `num` remains unchanged and continues to satisfy the condition that `1 <= num <= 10^9`. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, `count` is 0.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, `count` is 0**
