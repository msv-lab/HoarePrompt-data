According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. The loop will continue executing as long as \( i \times i \) is less than or equal to `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is now 3, and `num` is greater than or equal to 4. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition \( i \times i \leq num \):
- With `i` being 3, this means \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be at least 9.

Since `num` is currently greater than or equal to 4, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be adjusted to ensure it is at least 9. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` must be at least 9; `count` is increased to 4 if `num` is divisible by `i`; `i` is 3**
