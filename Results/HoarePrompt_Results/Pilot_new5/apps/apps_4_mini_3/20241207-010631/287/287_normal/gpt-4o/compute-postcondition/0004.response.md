The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 0, so after the operation, `count` becomes 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i`.**
