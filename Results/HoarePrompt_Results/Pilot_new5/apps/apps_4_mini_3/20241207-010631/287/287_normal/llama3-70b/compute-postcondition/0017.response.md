The value of `res` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State retains the previous conditions of `n` and `i` and specifies the change in `res`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is decreased by 1**.
