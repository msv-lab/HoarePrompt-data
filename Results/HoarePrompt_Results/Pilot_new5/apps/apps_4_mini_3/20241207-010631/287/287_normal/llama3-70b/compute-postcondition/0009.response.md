According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has a value that corresponds to the current iteration, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. Since `i * i` equals `n`, `i` has reached the value of the square root of `n`, meaning if `i` is currently `int(n ** 0.5)`, the loop will not execute again for `i` since the next increment will exceed this value. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. The next value for `i` would be `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, which is beyond the current valid range, so the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, to summarize:
- `i` is currently `int(n ** 0.5)`, and we need to account for the next potential value of `i`, which will be `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

So the adjusted state would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `res` is set to 1, `i` is int(n ** 0.5) + 1**
