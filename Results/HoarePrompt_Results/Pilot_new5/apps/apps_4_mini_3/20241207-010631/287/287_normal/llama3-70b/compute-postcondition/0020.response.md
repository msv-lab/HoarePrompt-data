The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the value of `res`. However, the code does not modify any variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values.

Output State: **`res` is the total number of divisors of `n`, `i` is equal to int(n)**
