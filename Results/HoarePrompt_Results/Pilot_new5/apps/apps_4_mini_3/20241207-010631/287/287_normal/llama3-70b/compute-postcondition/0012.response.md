The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The value of `res` was set to 3 if `n` is divisible by `i`, and to 1 otherwise. Therefore, after decrementing, if `n` is divisible by `i`, `res` will be 2; if not, `res` will be 0. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9; `res` is 2 if `n` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `res` is 0.**
