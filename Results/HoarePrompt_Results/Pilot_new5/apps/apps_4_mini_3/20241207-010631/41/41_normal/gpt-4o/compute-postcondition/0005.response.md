`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting an input line and converting them to integers. The input will provide two integer values. The range of `n` does not affect `a` and `b`, as they are independent of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer**.
