The code `ratings_before.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The previous state of `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice, meaning it initially contains `[a, a]`. After appending `a`, `ratings_before` will now contain `[a, a, a]`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` is `n + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` three times, `ratings_after` includes the value of `b` twice.**
