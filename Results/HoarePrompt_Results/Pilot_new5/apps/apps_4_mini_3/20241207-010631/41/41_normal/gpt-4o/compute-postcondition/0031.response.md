According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `n` is within the range of 3 to 1000, `n` must at least be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3, and since it holds `i < n`, it must be ensured that `n` is greater than 3. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 3, and if the condition `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` holds true, then `is_unrated` is True**
