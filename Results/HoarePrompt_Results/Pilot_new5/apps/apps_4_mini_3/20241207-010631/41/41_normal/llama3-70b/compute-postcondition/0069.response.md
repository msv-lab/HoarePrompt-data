Output State: **`unrated` is False if there exists at least one `j` such that `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`; otherwise `unrated` remains True. `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` will have iterated from 1 to `n-1`.**
