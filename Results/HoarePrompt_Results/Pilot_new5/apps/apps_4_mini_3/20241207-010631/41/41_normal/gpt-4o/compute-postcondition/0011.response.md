The code takes two space-separated integers from the input and maps them to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` will be updated accordingly. The conditions regarding `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `k` remain unchanged, but it's important to note that the values of `a` and `b` will now be based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; if `a` is not equal to `b`, `ratings` is updated to include the tuple `(a, b)` and `is_rated` is set to True; `k` is adjusted to `k + 1` (which must be less than `n`).**
