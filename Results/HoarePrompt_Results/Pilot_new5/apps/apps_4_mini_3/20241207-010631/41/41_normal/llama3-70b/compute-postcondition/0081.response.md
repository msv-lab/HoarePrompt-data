The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal conditional structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `unrated` is either True or False, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 1000, `rated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`unrated` is either True or False, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 1000, `rated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
