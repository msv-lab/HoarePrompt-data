You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

Output

1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

2777 2777

2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and for each participant, a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126, where a_i is the rating before the round and b_i is the rating after the round.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings.append((a, b))
        
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b); `is_rated` is True if at least one tuple (a, b) has a ≠ b, otherwise it is False; `is_unrated` is False; all values of `a` and `b` are the integers input during the iterations.
    if (not is_rated) :
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `is_unrated` is True if there exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple increases; otherwise, `is_unrated` is False. `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b), and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b); `is_rated` is False, then `is_unrated` is True if there exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple increases; otherwise, `is_unrated` is False.
    if is_rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if is_unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b); `is_rated` is False; if there exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple increases (`is_unrated` is True), the output is 'unrated'; otherwise, the output is 'maybe'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b); if `is_rated` is True, then `is_unrated` is False and 'rated' has been printed. If `is_rated` is False, and there exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple increases, then `is_unrated` is True and the output is 'unrated'; otherwise, the output is 'maybe'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of participants, and for each participant, it processes their ratings before (`a_i`) and after (`b_i`) a round. The function checks if any participant's rating has changed (`is_rated`). If at least one rating has changed, it outputs 'rated'. If no ratings have changed and at least one rating before the round is less than a subsequent rating, it outputs 'unrated'. If there are no changes and ratings are non-increasing, it outputs 'maybe'. The function handles cases where `n` can range from 2 to 1000 and ratings are integers between 1 and 4126.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
