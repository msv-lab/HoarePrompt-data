To determine the required states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop.

1. The loop iterates over a range from 0 to `n - 1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at all. Since `n` is already specified to be between 2 and 1000, it is guaranteed that `n` is valid for the loop execution.

2. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n - 1` during each iteration of the loop. Initially, before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, but it will be initialized to 0 when the loop begins.

Based on the information provided, the necessary states to ensure the loop executes are:

- `n` is confirmed to be between 2 and 1000 (which is valid for loop execution).
- `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

There are other variables (`ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe`), but the loop execution primarily depends on `n` and `i`. The other states do not directly impact the ability to enter the loop.

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop begins would be:

State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0**
