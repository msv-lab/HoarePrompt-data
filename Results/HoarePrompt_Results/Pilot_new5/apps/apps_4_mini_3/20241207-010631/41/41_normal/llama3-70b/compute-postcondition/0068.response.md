Postcondition: ***`unrated` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `unrated` remains True.***
