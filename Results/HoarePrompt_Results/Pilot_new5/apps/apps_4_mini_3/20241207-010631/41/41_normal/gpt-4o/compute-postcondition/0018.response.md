The value of `is_rated` is assigned to `True`, but it is already `True` as per the initial state. There are no changes to the other variables, so the output state remains the same. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)` twice; `is_rated` is True; `k` is adjusted to `k + 2` (and `k + 1 < n)**
