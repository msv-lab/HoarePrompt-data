The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, the value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the value of `ratings_before` at index `j`, and the value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the value of `ratings_after` at index `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
