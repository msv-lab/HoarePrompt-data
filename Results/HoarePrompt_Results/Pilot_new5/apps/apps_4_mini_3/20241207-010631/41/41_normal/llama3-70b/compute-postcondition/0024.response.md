Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If the current value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and the current value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
