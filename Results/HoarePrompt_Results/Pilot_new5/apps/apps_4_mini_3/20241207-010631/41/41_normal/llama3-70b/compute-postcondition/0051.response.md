Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If for all values of `j` from 2 to `n - 1`, the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is not satisfied, then `unrated` remains False. If the condition is satisfied for any `j`, `unrated` is set to False and the loop is broken out of.**
