According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j`, which starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `n`. The value of `i` is currently 0, which means `j` will start at 1 for the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `j` must be less than `n` in order for the loop to execute again. 

After the last iteration, `j` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the next loop iteration to occur, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`unrated` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `j` is 3**
