Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b); `is_rated` is False, then `is_unrated` is True if there exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple increases; otherwise, `is_unrated` is False.***
