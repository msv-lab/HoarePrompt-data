The code `print('unrated')` outputs the string 'unrated', but it doesn't change the values of any variables. The variables retain their previous states, and the output simply indicates a message to be displayed. 

The initial conditions indicate that `is_rated` is False and `is_unrated` is True, confirming that there indeed exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple increases. However, this does not change after the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b); `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is True; and the output is 'unrated'.**
