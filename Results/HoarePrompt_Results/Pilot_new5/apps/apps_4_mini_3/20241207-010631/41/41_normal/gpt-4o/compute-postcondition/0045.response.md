Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples of input integers (a, b); if `is_rated` is True, then `is_unrated` is False and 'rated' has been printed. If `is_rated` is False, and there exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple increases, then `is_unrated` is True and the output is 'unrated'; otherwise, the output is 'maybe'.***
