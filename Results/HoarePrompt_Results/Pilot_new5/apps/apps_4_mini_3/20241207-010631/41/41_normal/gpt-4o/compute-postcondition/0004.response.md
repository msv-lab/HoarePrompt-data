According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute a number of times equal to the value of `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), the loop can execute at least 2 times. 

At the start of the loop, the loop variable (in this case, represented by underscore `_`) does not need an initial value since it's not used. However, it's important to note that there is no adjustment necessary for `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` for the loop to execute as they do not dictate the execution of the loop itself.

Thus, the only relevant state is the value of `n`. Since `n` is already an input integer within the specified range (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000), the loop is guaranteed to execute.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000**
