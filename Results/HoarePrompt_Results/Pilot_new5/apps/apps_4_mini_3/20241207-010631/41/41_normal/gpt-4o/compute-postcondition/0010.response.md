According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `n`, which determines how many times it will execute. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, it indicates that the loop can run at least 2 times and at most 1000 times. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed a certain number of times (let's denote it as `k`). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to `k + 1`, ensuring that the loop can iterate again.

Since the loop variable is represented by `_`, it does not affect the state, but the only condition we need to check is that the loop can execute again. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop has executed `k + 1` times, and `n` remains unchanged as it does not change during the loop execution, and `ratings` and `is_rated` may or may not change depending on the loop body which is omitted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers; if `a` is not equal to `b`, `ratings` is updated to include the tuple `(a, b)` and `is_rated` is set to True; k is adjusted to k + 1 (which must be less than `n`).**
