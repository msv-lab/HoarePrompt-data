The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The list `ratings_before` already includes the value of `a`, so after appending, it will contain the value of `a` twice. The other variables `_`, `n`, `b`, and `ratings_after` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` is `n`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice, `ratings_after` includes the value of `b`.**
