According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `j` being initialized to `i + 1`, which means in this case, `j` is currently 2, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to check the next value.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` as 0 and `j` as 2, and since `n` is between 2 and 1000, we know that there are potentially more values for `j` to take on. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 3.

For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n` (which is greater than or equal to 3 to proceed). Therefore, the updated states should reflect that:

State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
