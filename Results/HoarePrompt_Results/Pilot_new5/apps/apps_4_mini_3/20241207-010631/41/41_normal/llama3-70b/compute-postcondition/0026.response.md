The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and `j`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `unrated` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `unrated` is False**
