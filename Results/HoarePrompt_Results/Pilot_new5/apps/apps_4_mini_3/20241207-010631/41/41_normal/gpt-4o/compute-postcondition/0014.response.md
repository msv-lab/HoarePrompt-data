Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`; `is_rated` is True; `k` is adjusted to `k + 1` (and `k < n`). If `a` is not equal to `b`, the values of `a`, `b`, `ratings`, and `is_rated` remain unchanged, and `k` is incremented by 1.***
