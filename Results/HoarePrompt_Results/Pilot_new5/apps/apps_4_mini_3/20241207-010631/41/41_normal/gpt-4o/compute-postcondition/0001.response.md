The variable `ratings` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as the code does not interact with it. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of `n` and the new state of `ratings`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` is an empty list.**
