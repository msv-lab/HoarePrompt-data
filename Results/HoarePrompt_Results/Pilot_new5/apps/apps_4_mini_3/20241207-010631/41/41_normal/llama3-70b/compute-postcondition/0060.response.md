Postcondition: ***`unrated` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. If the value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the value of `ratings_before` at index `j` and the value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the value of `ratings_after` at index `j`, then `unrated` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `unrated` remains True.***
