The `current_set.clear()` method is called, which empties the `current_set`. The values of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `clear()` operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` is updated to max(max_count, current_count)**.
