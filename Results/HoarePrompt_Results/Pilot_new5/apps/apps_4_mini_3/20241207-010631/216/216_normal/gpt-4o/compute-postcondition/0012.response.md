The code updates the value of `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `current_count`. Since no specific value for `max_count` or `current_count` has been provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_count`. However, we can express this in the output state by showing the relationship.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is an uppercase letter or a non-alphabetic character; `max_count` is updated to max(`max_count`, `current_count`).**
