`current_count` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `max_count` remains unchanged as it is defined as the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`. Since `current_count` is `0`, `max_count` will either stay the same or be updated if it was less than `0` (which it cannot be since it's the maximum). The states of the other variables are not affected, and they retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, `current_set` is now empty, `current_count` is 0.**
