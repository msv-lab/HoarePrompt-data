Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` now contains `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, then neither `current_set` nor `current_count` is changed.***
