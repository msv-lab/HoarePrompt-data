`current_set` adds the value of `char`, which is the third character of the string `s`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, and `current_set` has the character `char` added to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, and `current_set` now contains `char`**
