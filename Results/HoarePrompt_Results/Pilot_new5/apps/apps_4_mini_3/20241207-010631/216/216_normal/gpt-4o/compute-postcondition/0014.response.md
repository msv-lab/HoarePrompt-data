The variable `current_count` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the values of other variables or their states, but it sets `current_count` to zero. The other variables remain unchanged in their conditions as described.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is an uppercase letter or a non-alphabetic character; `max_count` is updated to max(`max_count`, `current_count`); `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0.**
