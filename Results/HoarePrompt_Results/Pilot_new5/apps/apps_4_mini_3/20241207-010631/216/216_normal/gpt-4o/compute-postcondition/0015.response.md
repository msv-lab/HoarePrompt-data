Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the first character of `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is an uppercase letter or a non-alphabetic character, then `max_count` is updated to the maximum of `max_count` and `current_count`, `current_set` is set to empty, and `current_count` is reset to 0.***
