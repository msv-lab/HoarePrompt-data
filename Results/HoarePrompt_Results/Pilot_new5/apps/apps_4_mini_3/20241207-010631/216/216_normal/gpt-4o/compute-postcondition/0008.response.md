The variable `current_set` is updated by adding the value of `char` to it. The initial state specifies that `char` is the first character of `s`, which is a lowercase letter, and it is not currently in `current_set`. After executing the code, `char` will now be a member of `current_set`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the first character of `s` and is a lowercase letter, and `current_set` now includes `char`.**
