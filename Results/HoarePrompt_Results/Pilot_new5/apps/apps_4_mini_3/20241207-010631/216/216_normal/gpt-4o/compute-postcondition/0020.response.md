The `max_count` variable is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. The initial state specifies that `max_count` remains unchanged prior to this execution, but it is now impacted by the calculation. The value of `max_count` will depend on the comparison between its previous value and `current_count`. 

Since we don't know the specific initial value for `max_count` or `current_count`, but know that `max_count` will now reflect the greater of the two, we can express the output conditionally based on their relationship.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` remains unchanged, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` is updated to max(max_count, current_count)**.
