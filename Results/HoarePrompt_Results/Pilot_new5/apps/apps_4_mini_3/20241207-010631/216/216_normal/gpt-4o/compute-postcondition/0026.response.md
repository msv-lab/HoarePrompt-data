The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `current_count` is now unknown, but `n` remains a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is still a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` continues to be the third character of `s`, and `current_set` contains `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, `current_set` now contains `char`, `current_count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, `current_set` now contains `char`, `current_count` is increased by 1.**
