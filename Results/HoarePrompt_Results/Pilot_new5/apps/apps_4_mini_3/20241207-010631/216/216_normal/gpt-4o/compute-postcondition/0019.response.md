Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `char` is the second character of `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` now includes `char`, and `current_count` is increased by 1, while `max_count` remains unchanged. If `char` is already in `current_set`, then both `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged, and `max_count` also remains unchanged.***
