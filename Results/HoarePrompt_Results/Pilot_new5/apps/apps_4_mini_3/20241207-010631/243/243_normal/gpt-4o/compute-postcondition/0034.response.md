The impact of the code on the program is that `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The variables `low` and `high` are not affected, but `mid` now holds a value which is the midpoint between `low` and `high`. Since `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be in the range of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2**
