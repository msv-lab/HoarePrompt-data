Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; if `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` while `high` remains unchanged, and `zeroes` is recalculated from `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `zeroes` remains the result of `func_1(mid)`. Otherwise, `left` is set to `mid - k`, `right` is set to `mid + n`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `low` and `high` still satisfy the condition that `low` remains less than or equal to `high`.***
