The value of `n` is 1, and when checking the condition `n // 5`, it results in 0 because 1 divided by 5 (floor division) equals 0. Therefore, the condition is false, and the value of `count` remains unchanged at 0. 

The code `count += 1` will not execute because the condition is not satisfied. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000, `count` is 0, and `n` is 1.**
