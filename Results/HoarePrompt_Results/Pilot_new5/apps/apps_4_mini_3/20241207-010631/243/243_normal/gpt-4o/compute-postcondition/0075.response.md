The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, and `right` must be adjusted so that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, and `right` is now adjusted to be one greater than its previous value to ensure `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `right` is adjusted to be one greater than its previous value.**
