`zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, where `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2. The values of `m`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged, and `mid` is now determined by the current values of `low` and `high`. Since `mid` is based on `low` and `high`, we can express its value directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.**
