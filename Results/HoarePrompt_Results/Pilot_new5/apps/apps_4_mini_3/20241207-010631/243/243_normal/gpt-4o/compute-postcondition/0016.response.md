According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(left)` returning a value equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` has been adjusted to `left - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left - 1)` must equal `m`. 

Since no specific constraints about `left` are provided, we cannot determine if `func_1(left - 1)` will equal `m` without further information about the behavior of the function `func_1`. Therefore, we need to make an adjustment to ensure that it will.

We can require that `left` must be adjusted such that it allows `func_1(left - 1)` to potentially return `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer, we can assume that `left` must be at least `m + 1` to ensure that `func_1` can potentially reach the value `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` must be at least `m + 1`**
