To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `low <= high`. According to the provided program state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that the values of `low` and `high` are such that they currently satisfy the condition (i.e., `low` is less than or equal to `high`).

Since the loop can continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`, there is no need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the program state can be repeated without any modifications.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high`**
