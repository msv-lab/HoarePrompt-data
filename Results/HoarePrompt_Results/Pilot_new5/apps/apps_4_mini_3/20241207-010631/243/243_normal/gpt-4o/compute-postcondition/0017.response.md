The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is at least `m + 1`, meaning it is guaranteed to be at least 2 (since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m`). Thus, after the operation, `left` will still be at least 1.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is at least `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is at least `m`.**
