Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, indicating that all values from the original `left` down to `left + 1` (inclusive) returned the value `m` when passed to `func_1`. The value of `left` has been decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, and the original value of `left` was greater than or equal to the final value of `left`.**
