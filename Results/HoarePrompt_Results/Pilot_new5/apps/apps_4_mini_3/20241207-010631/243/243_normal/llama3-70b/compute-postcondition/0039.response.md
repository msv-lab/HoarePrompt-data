Functionality: ** The function prompts the user for an integer input `m` (where 1 <= m <= 100000), then calculates the smallest integer `count` such that `1 // 5 ** count` is greater than or equal to `m`. It then collects all integers from 1 up to the largest integer `n` such that `n // 5 ** count` is still greater than or equal to `m` into a list `ans`. Finally, it prints the length of `ans` and the integers contained in `ans`. If `m` is greater than 1, `ans` will be empty, and the function will print '0' followed by nothing.**
