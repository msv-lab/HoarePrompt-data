The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `low` and `high` are not specified, but they are known to maintain the relationship where `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Therefore, `mid` will fall within the range of `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
