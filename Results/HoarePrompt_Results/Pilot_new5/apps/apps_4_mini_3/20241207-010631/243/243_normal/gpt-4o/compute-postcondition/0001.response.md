The variables `low` and `high` are assigned new values based on the initial state of `m`. The variable `low` is set to 0, and `high` is calculated as 5 times (`m` + 1). Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, we can specify the value for `high` as it will always be greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 500,005.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500,005.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1)**
