In the provided code snippet, the condition `if n // 5` is evaluated. Given the initial state that `n` is 1, the integer division `n // 5` results in 0 (since 1 divided by 5 is 0 with integer division). This means the condition evaluates to `False`, and therefore, the line `count += 1` does not execute, leaving `count` unchanged.

The values of the other variables remain the same as they were in the initial state since the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1.**
