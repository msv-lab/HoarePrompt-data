The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The previous value of `right` was the original value, and after the increment, it becomes the original value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(right)` must be adjusted back to equal m, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is equal to the original value of `right` + 1.**
