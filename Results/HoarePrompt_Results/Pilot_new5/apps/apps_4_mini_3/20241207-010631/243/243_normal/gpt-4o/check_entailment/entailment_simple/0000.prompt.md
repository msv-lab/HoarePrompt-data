You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is less than 625, `power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 greater than the original value of `n`, `count` is the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of `n` by all powers of 5 up to the last valid `power_of_5` used in the loop.
    return count
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of n by all powers of 5 up to the smallest power of 5 greater than the original value of n.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains the integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` is the last position where `func_1(left) < m` and `right` is the first position where `func_1(right) > m`. The values of `low` and `high` reflect the final bounds of the search space, with `mid` being the last computed midpoint resulting from the last iteration of the loop. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, then `result` contains all values with the property that `func_1(value) == m`. If the loop did not find a match, `result` would remain an empty list.
    return result
    #The program returns the integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, which are the values that satisfy the conditions related to `func_1` and the search space defined by `low` and `high`. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, then `result` contains all values with the property that `func_1(value) == m`. If no match was found, `result` would be an empty list.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
