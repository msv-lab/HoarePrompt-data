According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`. 

Right before the loop, it is stated that `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, which doesn't directly affect the loop condition but shows that `left` could be adjusted. However, the crucial part is whether `func_1(right)` currently evaluates to `m`. If it does, the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to modify the state of `right` so that `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

Since `right` is currently set to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`, we can infer that we need to adjust `right` to a value such that `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. 

We do not currently have enough information about how `func_1` behaves, so we cannot definitively state what precise modification is needed.

To ensure the loop can execute, we can assume we need to adjust `right` in a way that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`. This could mean setting `right` to a value lower or higher than its current value that would yield a different result when passed to `func_1`.

Given the information and assumptions we're working with, we can summarize:

State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` must be adjusted so that func_1(right) is not equal to m.**
