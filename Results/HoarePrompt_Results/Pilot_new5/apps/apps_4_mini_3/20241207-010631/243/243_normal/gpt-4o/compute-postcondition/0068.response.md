To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`. 

1. The loop can continue as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, and `func_1(left)` must currently equal `m` for the loop to execute one more time.
3. If `func_1(left)` equals `m`, then for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `left` can still satisfy `func_1(left) == m` after any potential adjustments to `left`.

Since `left` is defined as `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, we can ensure that `left` remains valid by maintaining the condition for `func_1(left)` to produce the same output. This means that `left` needs to remain such that `func_1(left)` still returns `m`. 

Currently, we don't have a specific value for `low`, `high`, or the results of `func_1`, but we know that `left` must be adjusted accordingly to keep `func_1(left)` equal to `m`.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute another iteration, we need to adjust `left` to a value that still satisfies `func_1(left) == m`.

Thus, the adjusted state would be:
State: **`left` must be such that func_1(left) still equals `m`**
