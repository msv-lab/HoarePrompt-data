To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions provided.

1. The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `func_1(left + 1) != m`
   - `func_1(left) < m`
   - `right` has been adjusted to be one greater than its previous value.

Given that `right` has been increased and we don't have any specific values for `func_1(right)`, we need to ensure that after updating `right`, the condition `func_1(right) == m` still holds for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `func_1(left + 1) != m`, it indicates that `left + 1` is not a solution. Additionally, `func_1(left) < m` suggests that `left` is not a solution either, implying that `func_1` is increasing as we move to the right.

For the loop to execute again, we need `func_1(right)` to equal `m`. Since `right` has already been adjusted to be one greater than its previous value, we must ensure that:

- `right` should be adjusted such that `func_1(right)` is equal to `m` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, we conclude that `func_1(right)` must equal `m` after the adjustment.

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, and `right` must be adjusted such that `func_1(right) == m`**.
