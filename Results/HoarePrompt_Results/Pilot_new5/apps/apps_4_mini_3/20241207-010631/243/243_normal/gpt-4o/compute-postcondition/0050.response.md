According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, so this condition is satisfied. 

However, we need to ensure that the value of `right` remains unchanged and is appropriate for the condition to hold true in the next iteration. Since `right` is equal to `mid + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, it does not need to be adjusted, as it will still satisfy the loop condition in the next iteration.

The states `left`, `func_1(left)`, `func_1(right)`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged, as no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`left` is equal to `mid - k`, `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged; `right` is equal to `mid + 2**
