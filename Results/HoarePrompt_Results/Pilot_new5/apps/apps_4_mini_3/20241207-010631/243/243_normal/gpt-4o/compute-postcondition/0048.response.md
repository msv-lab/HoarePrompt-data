According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_1(right)` in relation to `m`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`. Right before the loop, it is specified that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, but there is no information about what `func_1(right)` currently evaluates to. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` evaluates to `m`.

Thus, the state needs to be modified to ensure `func_1(right)` equals `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`left` is equal to `mid - k`, `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged; `right` is equal to `mid + 1**
