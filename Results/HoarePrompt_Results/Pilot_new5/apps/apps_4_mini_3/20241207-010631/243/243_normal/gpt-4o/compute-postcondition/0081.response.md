The variable `result` is assigned a list created by `range(left + 1, right)`. Given the initial conditions, `left` is such that `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, and `func_1(right)` is greater than `m` after the loop. The range starts from `left + 1` and goes up to `right`, including `left + 1` but excluding `right`. 

Since `right` is such that `func_1(right) == m + k` for some positive integer `k`, it implies that `right` is greater than `left + 1`. The function `range(left + 1, right)` will yield a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`. 

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `result` is assigned a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

Output State: **`right` is such that `func_1(right) == m + k` for some positive integer k where `k` is the number of times the loop executed; `left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, and `func_1(left)` is less than `m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
