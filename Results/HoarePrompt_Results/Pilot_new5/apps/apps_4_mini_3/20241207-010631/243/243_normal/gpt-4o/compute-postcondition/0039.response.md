The value of `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged, but the specific value of `mid` is not given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of other variables and the updated value of `left`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`.**
