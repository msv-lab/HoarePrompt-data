Correctness: **False**

The provided program has issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem description requests the count of all positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. However, the program does not correctly handle certain cases, particularly when there are no such \( n \) values that meet the condition.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Output**: If there are no integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes, the output should be `0`. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle all scenarios leading to this condition, potentially leading to ambiguous or incorrect outputs.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program uses binary search to find the range of integers whose factorials have exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. While the approach of using `func_1` to count trailing zeroes is correct, the way the bounds `left` and `right` are adjusted may miss some edge cases. Specifically, if there are gaps in \( n \) where \( func_1(n) \) equals \( m \), it does not guarantee that all valid integers are captured in `result`, or it may incorrectly assert that there are valid integers when there are not.

3. **Missing trailing zeroes scenarios**: In the example provided with \( m = 5 \), the output is expected to be `0`, but the logic in `func_2` may fail to accurately determine that no such integers exist that yield exactly 5 trailing zeroes.

4. **Loop Control**: The way the loop in `func_2` is constructed can lead to early exits or missed counts since it breaks out of the loop upon finding the first valid \( mid \), which might not encompass all possible \( n \).

Due to these reasons, the program does not consistently meet the problem's requirements for all input scenarios, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
