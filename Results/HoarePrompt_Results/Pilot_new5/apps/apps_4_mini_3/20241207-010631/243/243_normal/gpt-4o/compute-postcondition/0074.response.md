According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`. Right before the loop, we know that `right` is defined such that `right` is equal to `mid + 1`. Since `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m` and `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, we cannot determine the value of `func_1(right)` directly. However, in order for the loop to execute, we need `func_1(right)` to be equal to `m`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Therefore, we cannot ascertain whether `m` can be achieved with the current states of `left` and `right`. 

Thus, the required adjustment is that `right` must be adjusted in such a way that `func_1(right) == m`.

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, and `right` must be adjusted so that func_1(right) equals m**.
