According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right`. The loop can execute again as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is equal to the original value of `right` + 1, meaning that it is larger than its original value. Furthermore, we know that `func_1(right)` must be adjusted so that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m`. Therefore, we need to state that `func_1(right)` currently must be equal to `m` before we adjust it. 

In summary, we need to clarify that `func_1(right)` should be equal to `m` before any modifications are made. Additionally, after we adjust `func_1(right)`, it should not equal `m` anymore.

State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is equal to the original value of `right` + 1, and `func_1(right)` must be adjusted so that func_1(right) is not equal to m.**
