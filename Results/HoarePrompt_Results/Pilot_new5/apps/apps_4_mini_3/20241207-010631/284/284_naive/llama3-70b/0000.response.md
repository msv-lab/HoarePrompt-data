To analyze the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to ensure that the program correctly finds a value of `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for the given positive integer `n`.

Let's break down the program:

1. The input number `n` is read from standard input.
2. A loop runs `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each `m`, the program checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number by calling the `func_1` function.
4. The `func_1` function checks for primality by:
   - Returning `False` for numbers less than 2.
   - Checking divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.

Now, let's analyze if there are any potential cases where the program may fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.

**Counterexample Investigation:**
- For any given `n`, the program needs to find at least one `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime. The prompt guarantees that such an `m` exists for \( 1 \leq m \leq 1000 \).
- The loop will break upon finding the first valid `m`.
  
**However, consider an important aspect:**
- The check for primality correctly identifies numbers that are not prime. 
- If we take an example, such as `n=1`, for `m=1`, \( 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \) (which is prime), `m=2` gives \( 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \) (still prime), and this continues until \( m=4 \) which leads to \( 5 \) (prime), and so forth. 

Continuing this check, we need to ensure that at least one `m` must yield a non-prime value. Given that it is guaranteed in the prompt, the program should logically work. 

**Conclusion:**
Since the program utilizes a loop to find a suitable `m` and correctly implements the primality test, it adheres to the problem constraints and conditions. 

Correctness: **True**. 

This is because for any valid input `n` within the specified range, the program will eventually find an `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, thus fulfilling the requirement of the problem statement.
