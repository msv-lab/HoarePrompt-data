To analyze the given program based on the problem description, let's break it down step by step.

The problem states that we need to find a positive integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for a given positive integer `n` within the range of 1 to 1000.

Now, let's examine the provided code:

```python
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

### Code Functionality:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads an integer `n`.
2. **Loop through `m`**: It loops through values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. **Checking primality**: For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this value is **not** prime using the `func_1` function.
4. **Output**: If it finds an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### Verification of Logic:

- The function `func_1` attempts to determine if a number is prime.
- The condition `if not func_1(n * m + 1)` is used to find a suitable `m`.

### Potential Cases to Test:

1. **For `n = 1`**:
   - `m = 1` gives `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (which is prime).
   - `m = 2` gives `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (which is prime).
   - Continuing this, we will eventually reach `m = 4`, which gives `1 * 4 + 1 = 5` (prime) and so on.
   - However, with `m = 5`, `1 * 5 + 1 = 6`, which is **not prime**. The program will correctly identify this.

2. **For `n = 2`**:
   - `m = 1` gives `2 * 1 + 1 = 3` (prime).
   - `m = 2` gives `2 * 2 + 1 = 5` (prime).
   - `m = 3` gives `2 * 3 + 1 = 7` (prime).
   - `m = 4` gives `2 * 4 + 1 = 9` (which is not prime). Again, this will be found correctly.

3. **For other values of `n`** up to 1000:
   - The checks will continue, and for most values of `n`, there should be a value of `m` that yields a non-prime number when calculating `n * m + 1`.

### Conclusion:

The code effectively fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description by finding an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime. It handles the range of `m` correctly and assures that an output will be produced since itâ€™s guaranteed that such an `m` exists.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
