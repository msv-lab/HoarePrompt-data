The value of `i` is assigned the specific integer value `5`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is 5.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is 5.**
