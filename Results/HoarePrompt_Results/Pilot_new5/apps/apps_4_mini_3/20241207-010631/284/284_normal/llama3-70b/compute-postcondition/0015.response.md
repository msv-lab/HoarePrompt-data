The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is divisible by 2, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. In other scenarios, the function proceeds to check divisibility and could return False in additional cases. If no divisibility is found within the loop, it returns True, indicating that `num` is prime. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number, returning False for non-prime conditions and True if `num` is prime. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer num and returns False if num is less than 2, returns False if num is divisible by 2, returns False for other non-prime conditions, and returns True if num is prime.**
