Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the problem description due to a flaw in the logic of the prime-checking function, `func_1`. 

1. The function `func_1` is designed to check whether a given integer `x` is prime. However, the checking mechanism is incomplete because it does not handle all cases effectively. For instance:
   - It checks if `x` is less than or equal to 1 and returns `False`, which is correct.
   - It correctly identifies `2` and `3` as prime numbers. 
   - However, when `x` is even and greater than `2`, it correctly returns `False`.
   - The function may incorrectly skip some non-prime numbers that could arise from the computation of `n * m + 1`.

2. The main loop in the program checks values of `m` from `1` to `1000`. However, due to the way the prime-checking is implemented, the function may not produce a non-prime result for some values of `m` when `n * m + 1` is prime. 

3. Furthermore, while the problem guarantees that a non-prime can be found for all values of `n`, the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that it will always return `False` for some values of `m` as required by the problem description. 

For example, if `n = 1`, the program will compute `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (which is prime) and move to `m = 2`, where it computes `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (also prime). It will eventually reach `m = 1000`, where it computes `1 * 1000 + 1 = 1001`, which is not prime, but the program could fail to output a counterexample before reaching this point if earlier values are not handled as non-prime.

As a result, the program does not guarantee finding a non-prime for all values of `n` within the defined limits, making it incorrect according to the problem description. Hence, the program does not fulfill the requirements as stated.
