The program provided attempts to find a positive integer \( m \) such that the expression \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given positive integer \( n \). The function `func_1` correctly determines whether a number is prime or not.

Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input and Range:**
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) and iterates \( m \) from 1 to 1000, which is within the specified range. 

2. **Prime Number Check:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime. It correctly identifies non-prime numbers and returns `False` for them.

3. **Finding a Counterexample:**
   - In the loop, as soon as a value of \( m \) is found such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. The problem guarantees that such an \( m \) exists, which is satisfied by the programâ€™s structure.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function handles numbers appropriately, returning `False` for numbers less than 2 (which are not prime), and correctly checks for divisibility to ascertain primality for numbers greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Validity of Output:**
   - It is guaranteed that there will be an \( m \) for any \( n \) in the range \( [1, 1000] \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, therefore, the program will always find a valid output.

Given these points, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality. Hence, the correctness of the program can be concluded as:

Correctness: **True**
