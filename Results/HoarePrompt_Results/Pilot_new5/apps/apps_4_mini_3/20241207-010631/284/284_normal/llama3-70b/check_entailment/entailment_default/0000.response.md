To assess the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze it against the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that for a given `n`, the expression `n·m + 1` results in a non-prime number. The range for `m` is specified from 1 to 1000. The program must output any such `m` that satisfies this condition.

### Program Code:
```python
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Output Hints:
The hints describe how the function `func_1` checks if a number is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks for factors for numbers greater than or equal to 2. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Checking if the logic meets the problem requirements**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` and iterates over `m` from 1 to 1000.
   - For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this result is non-prime using `func_1`.
   - The first `m` where `n * m + 1` is non-prime is printed.

2. **Possible Edge Cases**:
   - If `n * m + 1` is 1 (which is not prime), we expect that `m` can be chosen to lead to this outcome. However, since `n` is at least 1 and `m` starts from 1, `n * m + 1` will always be greater than 1.
   - The function `func_1` does not explicitly handle cases for `num < 1` but since all outputs will be `n * m + 1 >= 2`, this doesn't affect the program.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints discuss how `func_1` checks for primality and identifies non-prime numbers, which aligns with the purpose of determining if `n * m + 1` is not prime. There is a guarantee that a solution exists within the provided range.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. There are no edge cases identified where the program would not work as expected within the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). 

No logical inconsistencies or flaws were found, and the output hints corroborate the expected functionality.

Correctness: **True**.
