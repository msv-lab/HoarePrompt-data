Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and checks if `x` is a prime number. It returns False for integers less than or equal to 1, returns True for 2 and 3, and returns False for even numbers greater than 2 and numbers divisible by 3. For odd integers greater than 3, it checks divisibility by potential prime factors up to the square root of `x`, returning True if `x` is prime and False if it is not. **
