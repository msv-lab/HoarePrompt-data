To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition `i * i <= x`.

1. **Current state analysis**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 (this value does not affect loop continuation).
   - `x` is greater than or equal to 121, `x` is neither divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. This means `x` is an odd number greater than or equal to 121.
   - The value of `i` is increased by 6 from its previous value.

2. **Loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x`. To execute the loop one more time, the condition must still be satisfied after the increment of `i` by 6.

3. **Adjustment needed**:
   - Since `i` has been increased by 6, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` (let's denote the previous value as `i_old`) satisfies the condition:
     - `i_old + 6` must satisfy: 
     - \((i_{\text{old}} + 6) * (i_{\text{old}} + 6) \leq x\)

4. **State modification**: 
   - Since `i` has been increased by 6, the loop will execute one more time if \( (i_{\text{old}} + 6)^2 \leq x \). We need to ensure that `x` is sufficiently large to accommodate this increase. 
   - Therefore, we can adjust the state of `x` to ensure that this condition is met. 

To make it clear:
- If `i` was initially `i_old`, for the next iteration to be valid, we need \( x \) to be at least \((i_{\text{old}} + 6)^2\).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` must be at least (value of `i` + 6) squared; `x` is greater than or equal to 121; `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3, and `x` is not divisible by 5 or 7; value of `i` is increased by 6.**
