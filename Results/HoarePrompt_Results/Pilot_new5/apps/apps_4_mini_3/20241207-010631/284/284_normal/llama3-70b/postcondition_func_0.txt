The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range 1 to 1000. It returns False if `num` is less than 2. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for factors from 2 to the square root of `num`. If any factor divides `num` evenly, it returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If no factors are found, it returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number. The function does not handle cases where `num` is less than 1 as specified in the annotations.
