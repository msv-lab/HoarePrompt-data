Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate the sequence of fractions as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it only checks for the case when `n == 2` and directly returns "NO". However, there are other values of `n` for which a valid sequence can be generated, and the program fails to explore those cases thoroughly. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 4`. The required sum is \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \). We can create the fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\), which indeed sum to \(\frac{3}{4}\):

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

The program would incorrectly output "YES" with the fractions `1 2` and `1 4`, which do not satisfy the `1 < b_i < n` condition since the second fraction would have `b_i` equal to `n`.

Additionally, the generated fractions do not account for the condition \( 1 \le a_i < b_i \) properly. The program does not explore the full range of potential denominators that can divide `n` and miss the valid combinations that meet the requirements.

Thus, the program fails for multiple cases beyond just `n = 2`, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
