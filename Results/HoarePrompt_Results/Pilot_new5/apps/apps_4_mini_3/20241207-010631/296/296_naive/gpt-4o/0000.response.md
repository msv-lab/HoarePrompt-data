To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic within the program.

### Problem Summary
The task is to find a sequence of fractions \(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\) such that:
1. \(b_i\) divides \(n\) and \(1 < b_i < n\).
2. \(1 \leq a_i < b_i\).
3. The sum of the fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\).

### Program Analysis
Let's review the provided program:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))
```

### Key Points of the Program
1. It starts by checking if \(n \leq 2\) and returns 'NO' in that case, which is correct since no valid \(b_i\) would exist.
2. It finds divisors of \(n\) in the range from 2 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
3. After collecting divisors, it constructs fractions of the form \(\frac{1}{d}\) for each divisor \(d\) found.
4. Finally, it counts the fractions and returns the result.

### Testing Edge Cases
1. **Case \(n = 2\)**: The program correctly returns 'NO'.
2. **Case \(n = 3\)**: The program will also return 'NO', which is correct.
3. **Case \(n = 6\)**: The divisors are 2 and 3, which the program handles correctly, returning 'YES' with the correct fractions.

### Potential Case of Incorrectness
Now, let's consider a case where the program may fail:
- **Case \(n = 9\)**: The divisors would be 3 (since \(9\) is not divisible by \(2\)). The program finds a single fraction \(\frac{1}{3}\), but the required sum is \(1 - \frac{1}{9} = \frac{8}{9}\). A single fraction \(\frac{1}{3}\) does not achieve this sum, and the program does not have logic to handle multiple \(b_i\) values or their combinations effectively.

### Conclusion
The program fails to correctly check if the sum of the fractions adds up to \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\) when there are not enough valid \(b_i\). Therefore, it can produce incorrect results for certain values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where there are insufficient fractions to sum up to the required value.
