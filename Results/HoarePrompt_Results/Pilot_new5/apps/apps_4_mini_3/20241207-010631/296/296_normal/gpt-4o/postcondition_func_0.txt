The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it returns 'NO'. If `n` has divisors, it returns 'YES' along with the count of divisors and their corresponding tuples in the format (1, divisor). The function does not handle the case where `n` is a prime number correctly, as it would still return 'YES' with an empty divisor list if no divisors are found, while it should return 'NO' instead. Additionally, it does not explicitly handle cases for very large values of `n`, which could lead to performance issues in practice.
