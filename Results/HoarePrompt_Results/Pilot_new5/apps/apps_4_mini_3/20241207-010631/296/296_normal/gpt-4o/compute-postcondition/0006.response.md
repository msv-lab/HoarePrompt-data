The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the current value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `divisors`. Before this operation, `divisors` is an empty list. After the execution of the code, `divisors` will contain the value 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` is at least 4, `divisors` is [2], `i` is 2**
