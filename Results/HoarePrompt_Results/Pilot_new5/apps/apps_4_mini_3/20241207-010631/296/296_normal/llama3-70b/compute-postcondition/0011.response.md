Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (input through `input()`) and outputs 'NO' if `n` is equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it outputs 'YES', followed by the value `2`, and prints '1' and the value of `n // 2`, as well as '1' and the value of `n`. The function does not return any values; it only prints output based on the value of `n`. **
