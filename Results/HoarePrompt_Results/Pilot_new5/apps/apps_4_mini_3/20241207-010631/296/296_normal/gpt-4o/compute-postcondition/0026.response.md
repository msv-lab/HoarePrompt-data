The variable `fractions` is assigned a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of the integer 1 and an element `d` from the list `divisors`. The list `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, and `k` is the length of this list. Since `k >= 1`, the list `fractions` will contain at least one tuple. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` > 2, `k` is the length of `divisors` (k >= 1), `fractions` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (1, d) for each `d` in `divisors`.**
