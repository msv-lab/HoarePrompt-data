The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given that `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, it will hold a specific value based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, `i` will be equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, which is at least 3. 

The previous state of the variables, in this case, does not change except for the addition of `i` to the `divisors` list. The value of `divisors` is implicitly updated to include `i`, but we do not have the specific contents of the `divisors` list before the operation. Therefore, we will just note that `i` has been added to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `i` has been added to the list `divisors`.**
