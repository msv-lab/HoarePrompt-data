The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on an implicit positive integer `n` such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). The functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided details, but it is implied that the function will return a value based on the positive integer `n` within the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a positive integer n, returning a value based on n while ensuring that 2 <= n <= 10^9.**
