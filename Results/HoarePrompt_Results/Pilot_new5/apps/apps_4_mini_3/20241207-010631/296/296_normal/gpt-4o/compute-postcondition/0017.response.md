The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, and `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n))`. Since `n` is at least 4, `i` will be at least 2 because the square root of 4 is 2. The state of the variable `divisors` is not provided in the initial state, but it is implied that it is a list that can hold integer values.

The output state will include the unchanged preconditions and the new value of `divisors` which now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, and `divisors` now includes the value of `i`.**
