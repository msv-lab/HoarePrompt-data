According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `n`. The loop will iterate over the range from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. For the loop to execute, the starting point is `2`, and the endpoint must be greater than `2`, which implies that `math.sqrt(n)` must be at least `2`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^9` and `n > 2`, we can determine that the smallest value of `n` that meets these criteria is `3`, which gives `math.sqrt(3)`, approximately `1.73`, leading to `int(math.sqrt(3)) + 1` being `2`.

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, \( n \) must be at least `4` because `int(math.sqrt(4)) + 1` equals `3`, allowing the loop to iterate with `i` as `2` and `3`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to state that `n` should be at least `4`, and we can denote the initial value of `i` as `2` (the first value in the range).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` is at least 4, `divisors` = [], `i` is 2**
