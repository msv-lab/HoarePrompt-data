In the given code snippet, `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the result of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. The value of `n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, and `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be greater than or equal to 3 (since the minimum value of `n` is 4).

The operation `n // i` performs integer division of `n` by `i`. Given that `n` is at least 4 and `i` is at least 3, the result of `n // i` will be a positive integer, which will be appended to the `divisors` list.

Since the code does not modify `n` or `i`, and only affects the `divisors` list by adding a new element, the output will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `divisors` now includes `n // i`.**
