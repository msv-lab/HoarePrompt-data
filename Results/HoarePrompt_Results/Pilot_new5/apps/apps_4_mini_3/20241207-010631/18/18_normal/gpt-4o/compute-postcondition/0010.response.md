The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as the signature indicates that it takes no arguments. However, based on the constraints provided, we can infer that the function operates within the context of three integer variables: `n`, `k`, and `t`, which must satisfy specific conditions: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. 

The function's output is determined by these integer values, although the specific output based on these constraints is not detailed in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates within the context of three integers n, k, and t, returning values based on their relationships defined by the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.**
