The provided program is tasked with determining how many spectators are standing at a given time \( t \) based on the rules of the Mexican wave as described in the problem statement. 

Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) from input, which represent the total number of spectators, the maximum number of spectators standing at the same time, and the time at which we want to know how many spectators are standing.

2. **Cases for Time \( t \)**:
   - If \( t \leq k \): The program prints \( t \), which is correct because the first \( k \) spectators stand up sequentially. Therefore, at time \( t \), exactly \( t \) spectators will be standing.
   - If \( t > k \) and \( t \leq n \): The program prints \( k \). This is also correct because once all \( k \) spectators are standing, they remain standing until the \( n \)-th spectator stands. Thus, the number of standing spectators remains \( k \) during this interval.
   - If \( t > n \): The program prints \( n + k - t \). This case reflects the scenario where spectators begin to sit down after reaching the peak of \( k \) standing spectators. The formula \( n + k - t \) correctly represents the number of spectators that remain standing after \( t \) exceeds \( n \).

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program correctly handles the constraints where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), and \( 1 \leq t < n + k\). 

4. **Negative Values**: The concern raised in the annotation about potentially printing a negative integer for \( n + k - t \) is misplaced because \( t \) is guaranteed to be less than \( n + k \). Hence, \( n + k - t \) will always yield a non-negative result within the context of the problem description.

5. **Overall Logic**: 
   - For \( t = 1, 2, \ldots, k \): Output is \( t \).
   - For \( t = k + 1, \ldots, n \): Output is \( k \).
   - For \( t = n + 1, \ldots, n + k \): Output decreases from \( k - 1 \) to \( 0 \), which is correctly handled by \( n + k - t \).

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic necessary to determine the number of spectators standing at time \( t \) according to the rules described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
