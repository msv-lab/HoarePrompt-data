To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown

1. We have `n` spectators.
2. `k` spectators can stand at the same time.
3. The program must calculate how many spectators are standing at a given time `t` (where `1 â‰¤ t < n + k`).
4. The standing pattern changes over time:
   - From time 1 to `k`, the number of standing spectators increases by 1 each second.
   - From time `k + 1` to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`.
   - From time `n + 1` to `n + k`, the number of standing spectators decreases by 1 each second.

### Program Analysis

The function `func()` is designed to read three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`. It then computes the number of standing spectators based on the given rules:

```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

- When `t <= n`: 
  - The program uses `min(t, k)`. This correctly calculates the number of spectators standing since it will be the smaller of `t` (the time) or `k` (the maximum number who can stand).
  
- When `t > n`: 
  - It uses `k - (t - n) % k`. This checks how many spectators would be sitting based on the cyclical pattern once the maximum has been reached, and correctly subtracts from `k` the number of spectators that have to sit down as time progresses.

### Verifying Against Examples

Let's verify the examples given in the problem description:

1. **Example 1**: Input `10 5 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Calculation: Since `3 <= k`, the output will be `min(3, 5) = 3`. Correct.

2. **Example 2**: Input `10 5 7`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Calculation: Since `7` is more than `5` but less than or equal to `10`, the output will be `5`. Correct.

3. **Example 3**: Input `10 5 12`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Calculation: Since `12 > 10`, we do `5 - (12 - 10) % 5` which is `5 - 2 % 5 = 5 - 2 = 3`. Correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It accurately tracks the number of spectators standing at any given time `t` based on the rules provided in the problem description for all potential cases.

Thus, the final output is:
Correctness: **True**
