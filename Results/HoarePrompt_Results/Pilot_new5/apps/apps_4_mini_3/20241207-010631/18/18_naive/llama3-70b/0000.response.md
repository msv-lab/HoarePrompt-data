To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles the specified time `t` and how it calculates the number of standing spectators at that time.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`. It then evaluates the number of standing spectators based on the time `t`:

1. **If `t <= n`:** The program returns `min(t, k)`. This means:
   - At times from `1` to `k`, it correctly returns the number of spectators standing, which increases linearly from `1` to `k`.
   - From `t = 1` to `t = k`, the output is exactly equal to `t`.
   - At `t = k`, it outputs `k`, as expected.

2. **If `t > n`:** The program calculates the number of standing spectators as `k - (t - n) % k`.
   - This captures the state after all spectators have stood up (from `1` to `n`) and then spectators start sitting down.
   - The formula uses modulo to determine how many spectators are still standing after the initial `n` spectators have stood.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
Let's evaluate the program with some specific cases, especially focusing on edge values:

1. **Case when `t = n + 1`:**
   - Here, all `n` spectators are standing, and the first spectator sits down. The expected output is `k - 1` (since one spectator sits down).
   - The program will compute this as `k - (n + 1 - n) % k` which simplifies to `k - 1`, which is correct.

2. **Case when `t = n + k`:**
   - By this time, all spectators would have sat down again, and the expected output is `0`. 
   - The program computes this as `k - (n + k - n) % k`, which results in `k - k = 0`. This is also correct.

3. **Case when `t` is one more than `n` and `k` is minimum (k=1):**
   - For `n=10`, `k=1`, `t=11`, the expected output is `0` since the only spectator that stood up has sat down, and the program correctly computes this.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all test cases as described in the problem statement, and I can't identify any edge cases or scenarios where the computation would fail based on the logic provided.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the output will be:

Correctness: **True**.
