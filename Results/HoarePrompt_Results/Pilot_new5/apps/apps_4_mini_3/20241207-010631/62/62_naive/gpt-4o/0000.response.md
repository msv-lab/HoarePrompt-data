To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how it interprets the inputs and whether it accurately compares the two numbers represented in different bases.

The program correctly reads the input format, determining the number of digits and the bases for both numbers. It then converts each number from its respective base to a decimal value using the `func_1` function, which appears to implement the conversion correctly by multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the next digit.

However, the potential issue lies in the interpretation of bases greater than 10. In bases greater than 10 (up to 40), numerical digits above 9 (like 10 representing 'A' in hexadecimal) need to be handled. The program does not include any explicit handling for bases higher than 10 where digits could be represented by letters (A, B, C, etc.). 

### Example of an edge case:
If we consider a case where:
- `n = 1`, `base_x = 16` (a hexadecimal base)
- Digits of X: `[10]` (which represents 'A' in hexadecimal)
- `m = 1`, `base_y = 10`
- Digits of Y: `[10]` (which represents the number 10 in decimal)

In this scenario:
- `X = 10` (in hexadecimal) is equal to `16` in decimal.
- `Y = 10` (in decimal) is equal to `10` in decimal.

The output should be `>` (since 16 > 10). However, the program correctly reads this input and uses decimal conversions as implemented in `func_1`, so this specific case will yield the correct result.

However, any digits above 9 in bases above 10, if represented incorrectly, would lead to unexpected behavior. For example, for `n = 1`, `base_x = 11`, and digits of X as `[10]`, it should be treated as a single digit 'A' (10 in base 11) but could be misinterpreted by a simple integer conversion if not handled properly.

Despite this analysis, if we assume all the digits are valid and fall within the range specified by the bases, the program can handle all standard scenarios.

Based on the current analysis, the program is correct as it successfully converts and compares the numbers in different bases without leading to misinterpretation of valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
