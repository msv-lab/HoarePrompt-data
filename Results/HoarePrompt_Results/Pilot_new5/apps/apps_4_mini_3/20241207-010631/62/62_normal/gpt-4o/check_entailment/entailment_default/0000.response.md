To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of the code and check for any edge cases it may not handle.

### Problem Description
The task is to compare two numbers represented in different bases and output whether the first number is less than, greater than, or equal to the second number.

### Provided Program
1. The program reads input for two numbers, X and Y, along with their respective bases.
2. It converts these numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function.
3. It compares the two decimal values and prints the appropriate comparison symbol (`<`, `>`, or `=`).

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Base Conversion**: The `func_1` properly converts a number represented by a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. The core of the conversion logic appears to be correct: it multiplies the accumulated decimal value by the base and adds the next digit.
2. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them correctly and prints the appropriate relationship.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Inputs**: The smallest possible values for `n` and `m` are both 1, which is handled correctly by the program.
2. **Base Limits**: The bases are guaranteed to be between 2 and 40, which the problem description ensures will not lead to any invalid digits being provided.
3. **Leading Zeroes**: The problem specifies that there will be no leading zeroes, so the program does not need to handle that case.
4. **Different Base Sizes**: As long as the inputs are valid, different base sizes (2 to 40) are managed by the conversion logic.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the `func_1` function accepts a list of integers representing the digits of the number in a specified base. It confirms the conversion to decimal representation, which aligns with the code's function. It also notes that if `digits` is an empty list, the function returns 0, which is true but not applicable here since the input will always have digits.

### Conclusion
The code appears to accurately follow the problem description for all valid inputs as outlined. The conversion logic, comparison, and output are all executed as specified. I do not see any edge cases that would lead to incorrect outputs for valid inputs based on the problem specification.

Correctness: **True**.
