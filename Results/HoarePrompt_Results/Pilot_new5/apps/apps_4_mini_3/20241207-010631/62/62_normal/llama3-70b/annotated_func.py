#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a given base, where each digit is in the range [0, base) and base is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is equal to the integer represented by the digits in the given base, `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of the number, and `base` is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40.
    return result
    #The program returns the integer represented by the digits in the given base, where 'digits' is a list of integers representing the digits of the number and 'base' is an integer within the range from 2 to 40.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, representing the digits of a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` (where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40). It computes and returns the integer value represented by the `digits` in the given base. The function does not handle cases where any digit is outside the valid range for the specified base, which could lead to incorrect results if such digits are present.
