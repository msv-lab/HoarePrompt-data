According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 element, and `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, which is the first element of the list. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `digits` list must have at least 2 elements, and `digit` would then be the second element in the list.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit` (the second element of `digits`)**
