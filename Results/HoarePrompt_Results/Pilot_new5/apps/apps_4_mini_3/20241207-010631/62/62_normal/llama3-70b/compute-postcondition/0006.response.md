The variable `result` is assigned the new value of `result * base + digit`. The previous value of `result` is `digit * base + digit`, and `digit` is the third digit in the list `digits`. Hence, substituting this into the equation gives us:

```
result = (digit * base + digit) * base + digit
```

This can be simplified to:

```
result = digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit
```

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state retains the original conditions of `result`, `digits`, and `digit`, while updating `result` to its new computed value.

Output State: **`result` is equal to `digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit`, `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 digits, `digit` is the third digit in the list.**
