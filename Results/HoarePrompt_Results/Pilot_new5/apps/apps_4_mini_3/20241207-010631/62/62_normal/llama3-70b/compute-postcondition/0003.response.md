According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 2 digits, the loop executes again for the second digit. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 digits, and `digit` should be updated to the second digit in the list.

State: **`result` is equal to `digit`, `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list**
