To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and think about potential edge cases:

1. **Determining Frame Size:** 
   The program calculates the minimum and maximum coordinates of white pixels ('w') and uses these to determine the frame size. The frame size is calculated as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.

2. **Checking Frame Constraints:** 
   If the frame size exceeds the maximum of the screen dimensions `n` or `m`, it prints `-1`, indicating that a frame cannot be created within the screen.

3. **Constructing the Frame:**
   The program attempts to construct the frame by iterating over each pixel and checking if it should be a part of the frame (`+`), depending on whether it lies on the edges defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`. If itâ€™s a white pixel, it remains unchanged. The logic includes checking if the current pixel is on the frame and setting it to `+` if it's a black pixel.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   Finally, it prints the resulting pixel grid.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case where frame cannot exist:** For example, if there are white pixels in a configuration where they cannot form a contiguous square frame, such as a `w` isolated by black pixels. 
  - Example Input:
    ```
    2 3
    w..
    ...
    ```
  - The output should be `-1`, as there's no way to form a frame that contains the `w`.

- **Case with multiple white pixels:** If there are several white pixels that are apart, the current logic might not correctly identify that they cannot create a valid frame.
  - Example Input:
    ```
    5 5
    .....
    .w...
    .....
    ...w.
    .....
    ```
  - The expected output would be `-1` since the two `w` characters cannot be enclosed by a frame.

- **Single White Pixel:** If there is only one white pixel, the output should be a frame of size 1 around that pixel.
  - Example Input:
    ```
    3 3
    ...
    .w.
    ...
    ```
  - The program should output:
    ```
    +++
    +w+
    +++
    ```

### Issue Found:
In the current implementation, the program does not handle the case where multiple white pixels are not formable into a single frame correctly. It may also fail to identify cases where the frame cannot exist.

Therefore, based on these considerations, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly determine the impossibility of forming a frame for certain configurations of white pixels, which is a requirement stated in the problem description.
