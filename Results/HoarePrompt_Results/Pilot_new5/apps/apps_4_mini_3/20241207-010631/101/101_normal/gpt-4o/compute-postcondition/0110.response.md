Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` is updated to equal `i`, and `bottom` is also updated to equal `i`, while `left` remains the minimum column index of 'w' and `right` remains the maximum column index of 'w'. The current value of `j` is less than `left`.***
