The code assigns the value `'.'` to the pixel at the position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is equal to `m`, which is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the specific value of `j` is `m`. The other variables (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged as the operation only modifies the `pixels` array.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `m`; `pixels[1][m]` is '.'**
