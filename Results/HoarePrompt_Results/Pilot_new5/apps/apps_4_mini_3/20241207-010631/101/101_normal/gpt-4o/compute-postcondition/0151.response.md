Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all defined and not None; `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`. The current value of `frame_height` is less than 2 or the current value of `frame_width` is less than 2.***
