The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there are no changes made to the variables or states of the program, the output state remains the same as the initial state without any updates to the values of the variables. 

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` must be less than `m` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
