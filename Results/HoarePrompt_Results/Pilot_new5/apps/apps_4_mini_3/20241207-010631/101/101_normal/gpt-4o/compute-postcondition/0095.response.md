Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 2, and `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are both set to `n`, `left` is updated to 2, and `right` is updated to 2, while `i` remains equal to `n` and `j` remains equal to 2. If `top` is not None, then `top` will either remain unchanged if `i` is less than `top`, or it will be set to None if `i` is not less than `top`, while `bottom` remains equal to `n`, `left` is 1, and `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than the previous `right`. If the condition is not met, the values of `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` retain their current values.***
