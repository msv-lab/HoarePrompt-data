The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. Since the current value of `j` is greater than `right`, this means that `right` will now equal the value of `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so we will maintain their conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `right` is equal to `j`.**
