The values of `max_x` and `max_y` are updated by taking the maximum of their previous values and the current values of `x` and `y`. The initial state has `max_x` as float('-inf') and `max_y` as float('-inf') while `x` and `y` are known values. 

After evaluating the code:
- `max_x` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value (float('-inf')) and `x`. Hence, `max_x` becomes `x`.
- `max_y` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value (float('-inf')) and `y`. Hence, `max_y` becomes `y`.

No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`, `white_pixels` must contain at least 1 element, and `(x, y)` is the first element in `white_pixels`.

Output State: **`min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`, `white_pixels` must contain at least 1 element, and `(x, y)` is the first element in `white_pixels`.**
