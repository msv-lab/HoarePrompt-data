The code snippet assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The variable `j` is equal to `m`, which is an integer greater than 0. As a result, both `left` and `right` will now hold the value of `m`. 

The previous values of the affected variables were:
- `left` was set to 0
- `right` was set to `right` (which remains unchanged) 
- `j` is `m`.

After execution, the updated states of the affected variables are:
- `left` is now `m`
- `right` is now `m`

Other variables (`n`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `m`, `right` is equal to `m`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`.**
