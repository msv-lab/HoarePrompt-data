The code snippet assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Since `j` is `m`, `left` will now be equal to `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` is set to `n`, `left` is set to `m`, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` is set to `n`, `left` is set to `m`, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `m`.**
