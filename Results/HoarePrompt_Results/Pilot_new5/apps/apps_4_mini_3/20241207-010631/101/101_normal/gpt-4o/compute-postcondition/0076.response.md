Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains unchanged, if `i` (which is equal to `n`) is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to `n`, and `left`, `right` remain unchanged.***
