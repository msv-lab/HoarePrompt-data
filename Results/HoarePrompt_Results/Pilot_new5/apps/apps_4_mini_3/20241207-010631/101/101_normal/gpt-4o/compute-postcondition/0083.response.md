According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. The loop will iterate while `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 1. Since `m` is an integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be less than `m`, which means `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is None, `bottom` is `n`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2**
