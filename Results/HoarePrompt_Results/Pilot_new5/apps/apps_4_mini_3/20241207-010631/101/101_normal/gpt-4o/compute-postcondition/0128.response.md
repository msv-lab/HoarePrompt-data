Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` is set to `n`, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `m`, while `left` remains unchanged and `i` remains equal to `n`. If `j` is not greater than `right`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, and `i` remains equal to `n`.***
