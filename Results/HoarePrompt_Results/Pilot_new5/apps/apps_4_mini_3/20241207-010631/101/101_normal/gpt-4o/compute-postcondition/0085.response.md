The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial value of `j` is 2, so after execution, both `left` and `right` will equal 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2**
