Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is either None or equal to `n`; `bottom` is equal to `n`; `left` is equal to `m + 1`; `right` is equal to `m + 1`; `i` is equal to `n`; `j` is equal to `m + 1`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` remains unchanged; otherwise, there is no change to the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, or `j`.***
