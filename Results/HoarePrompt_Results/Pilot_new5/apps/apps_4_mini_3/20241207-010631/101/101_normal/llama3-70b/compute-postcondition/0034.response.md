Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `j` is `m`. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the state remains unchanged. If `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', then `pixels[i][j]` is now '.'***
