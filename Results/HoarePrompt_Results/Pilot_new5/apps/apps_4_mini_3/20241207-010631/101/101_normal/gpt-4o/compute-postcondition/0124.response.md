Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` is set to `n`, `left` is set to 0, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `m` if `i` (which is `n`) is less than `top`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, the postcondition is that `i` remains equal to `n` and no changes occur to the other variables. Otherwise, no else part is defined, leaving the variables in their current state.***
