The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Since `j` is given the value of `2`, `left` will now become `2`. The other variables remain unchanged because the condition regarding `i` and `bottom` does not affect the rest of them.

The output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is either `None` (if `i` is not less than `top`) or equal to `n` (if `i` is less than `top`), `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 2, `right` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 2.**
