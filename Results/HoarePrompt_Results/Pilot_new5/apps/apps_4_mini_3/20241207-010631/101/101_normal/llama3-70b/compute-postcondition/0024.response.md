The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, given that the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the `continue` statement indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration without making any changes to the state of the variables.

Since no variables are modified by the `continue`, the output state will retain all the original values, and the loop continues as intended.

Output State: **`min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' (no changes made).**
