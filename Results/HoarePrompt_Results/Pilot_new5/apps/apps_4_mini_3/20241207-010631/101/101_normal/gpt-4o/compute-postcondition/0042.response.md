The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is 2, therefore `left` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that `m` > 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 2, `left` is 2, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i.**
