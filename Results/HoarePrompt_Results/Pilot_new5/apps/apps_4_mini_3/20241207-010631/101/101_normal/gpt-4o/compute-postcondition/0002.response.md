According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute `m` times, starting with `j` being initialized to 0 and increasing by 1 until it reaches `m - 1`. Since `m` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. 

The important states to note are:
- The value of `j` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The variable `m` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop runs.

The other variables (`n`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `i`) do not directly affect the execution of this specific loop, but they are in the initial state.

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly, we need to maintain the current states of `n`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `i`, and ensure that `j` starts at 0 and `m` remains at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w', with at least one 'w', `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `j` is 0**
