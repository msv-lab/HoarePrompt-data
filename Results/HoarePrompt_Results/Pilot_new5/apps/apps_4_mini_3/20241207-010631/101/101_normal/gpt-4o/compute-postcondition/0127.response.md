Since `j` is equal to `m`, we check the condition: if `j` (which is `m`) is less than `left` (which is also `m`). This condition is not met (as `j` is equal to `left`). Therefore, no updates occur to `left`, `right`, or `i`; all remain unchanged. 

The only change is that `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is equal to `m`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` is set to `n`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` is equal to `m`, and `i` remains equal to `n`.**
