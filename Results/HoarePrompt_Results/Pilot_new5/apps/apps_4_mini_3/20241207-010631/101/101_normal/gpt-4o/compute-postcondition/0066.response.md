The value of `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently greater than the previously defined `right`. Since `j` is 0, `right` is now equal to 0. The other variables retain their previous values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, and the current value of `j` is greater than `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, and the current value of `j` is greater than `right`.**
