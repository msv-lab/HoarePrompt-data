In the initial state, we have the following conditions:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000.
- `m` is an integer greater than 0.
- `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'.
- `top` is None.
- `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w'.
- `left` is the minimum column index of 'w'.
- `right` is the maximum column index of 'w'.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `j` is initialized to 0.
- The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.

Now, the code snippet executes:
```
top = bottom = i
```

This line assigns the value of `i` (which is equal to `n`) to both `top` and `bottom`. After execution, the values of `top` and `bottom` are now equal to `n`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is initialized to 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
