Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 1. If the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` holds true and `pixels[2][1]` is '.', then `pixels[2][1]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[2][1]` is 'w', the current iteration of the loop is skipped; otherwise, `pixels[2][1]` remains '.' indicating the condition for 'w' was not met.***
