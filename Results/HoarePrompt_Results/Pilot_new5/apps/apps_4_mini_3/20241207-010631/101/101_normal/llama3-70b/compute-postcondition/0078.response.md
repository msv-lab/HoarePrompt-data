The variable `pixels` is a 2D array (or matrix) where the row index is `i` and the column index is `j`. The code assigns the value `'+'` to the specific position in the array defined by these indices. The values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 1 respectively.

Since `pixels[2][1]` is being assigned a value, the other variables remain unchanged. No further assignments or calculations are made that would alter the states of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `n`, and `m`.

Given the preconditions that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, we note that all other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 1; `pixels[2][1]` is '+'**.
