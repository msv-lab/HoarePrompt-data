Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 0, with the current value of `screen[i][j]` being 'w' and `top` not being None. If `j` is greater than `right`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, since `j` is not greater than `right` (which is 0), no changes occur, and the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain the same.***
