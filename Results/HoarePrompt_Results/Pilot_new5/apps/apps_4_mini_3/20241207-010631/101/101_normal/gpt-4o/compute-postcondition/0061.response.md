Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` and `right` are defined accordingly, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, no actions are taken since there is no else part.***
