Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully adhere to the problem description regarding the requirements for drawing the square frame. 

Here are the main issues:

1. **Frame Drawing Logic**: The logic for determining whether to draw a '+' character is flawed. The program uses the conditions `if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.'` to decide where to place the '+' signs. This could lead to incorrect placements if the corners of the frame should also be white pixels ('w') but are instead placed as '.' due to this condition.

2. **Frame Size Check**: The program checks if `frame_size > max(n, m)` to determine if a valid frame can be drawn. However, the frame size should be determined not just by the distance between `min` and `max` coordinates of white pixels but also if all pixels which should be on the frame are actually white. This check fails to validate if there are any dead pixels (i.e., black pixels where a white pixel should be) along the calculated frame path.

3. **Handling of Invalid Frames**: The program doesn't properly check if a frame can exist before drawing it. If any calculated edge of the frame (from `min_x` to `max_x` or `min_y` to `max_y`) contains any black pixels where a white pixel should be, the program should return -1. 

4. **Output of the Frame**: The program doesn't account for cases where it is possible to create a frame, but that frame might be less than required for the minimal valid frame. The output might miss the requirement of showing the smallest frame adequately.

To summarize, while the program attempts to calculate the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels and draw a frame around those coordinates, it fails to ensure that the frame is valid (i.e., it does not contain dead pixels) before proceeding to draw. Thus, it doesn't fulfill the requirement of the problem description for all potential cases.
