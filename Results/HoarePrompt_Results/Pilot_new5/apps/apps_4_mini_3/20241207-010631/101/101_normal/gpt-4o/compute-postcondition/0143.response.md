Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is either None or equal to `n`, and `bottom` remains `n`. If `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `n`, with `left` and `right` equal to `m + 1`, while `i` is set to `n` and `j` is set to `m + 1`. If `top` is defined, it remains unchanged, and `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` also remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `right`, `right` remains unchanged; otherwise, no changes occur to the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, or `j`.***
