Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`, respectively, and `frame_size` is defined as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than `max(n, m)`, the output is -1. Otherwise, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, and the pixels have been entirely printed row by row as strings, with `i` equal to `n` and `j` not applicable as the loop has completed all iterations.***
