According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; every element in `pixels[1]` has been checked.**
