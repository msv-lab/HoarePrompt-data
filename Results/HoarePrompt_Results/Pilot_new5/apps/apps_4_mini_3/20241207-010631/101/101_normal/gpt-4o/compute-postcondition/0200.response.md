Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000. `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w'. `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, and `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`, with `bottom` greater than `top`, `i` equal to `top + 2`, and `j` equal to `left + 2`. If `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[top + 2][left + 2]` is '+'; otherwise, there are no changes to the state regarding `result`.***
