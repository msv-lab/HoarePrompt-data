Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to 0. If `screen[n][0]` is 'w', `top` is set to `n` if it is None, and `bottom` is also set to `n`. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, all variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` retain their values.***
