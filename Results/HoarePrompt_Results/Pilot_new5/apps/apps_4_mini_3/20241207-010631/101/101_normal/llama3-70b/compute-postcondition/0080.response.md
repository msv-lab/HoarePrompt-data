The variable `pixels` is a 2D array, and the code snippet assigns the value `'.'` to the specific element located at the indices `[i][j]`, where `i` is 2 and `j` is 1. The initial state defines `i` as 2 and `j` as 1, meaning that the value of `pixels[2][1]` will now be `'.'`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not impacted by this assignment. 

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 1; `pixels[2][1]` is '.'**
