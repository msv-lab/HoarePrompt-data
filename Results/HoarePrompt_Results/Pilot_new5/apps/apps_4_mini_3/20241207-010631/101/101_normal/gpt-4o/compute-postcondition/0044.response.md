The code assigns the value of `j` to `right`. The initial state defines `j` as 2, so `right` will also be assigned the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects the variable `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that `m` > 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 2, `left` is 2, and `right` is 2.**
