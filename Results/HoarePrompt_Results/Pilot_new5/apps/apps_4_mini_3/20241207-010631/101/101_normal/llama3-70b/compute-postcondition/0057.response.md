Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is `m`. If `pixels[1][m]` equals 'w', we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[1][m]` is '.'***
