The values of `min_x` and `min_y` are updated based on the minimum values between their current states and the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `min_x` is initially `float('inf')` and `min_y` is also initially `float('inf')`, the new values will be determined by comparing these with `x` and `y`. Since `white_pixels` contains at least one element, we can assume `(x, y)` are defined and their values are finite.

Thus:
- `min_x` will be assigned the minimum value between `float('inf')` and `x`, which will be `x`.
- `min_y` will be assigned the minimum value between `float('inf')` and `y`, which will be `y`.

The values of `max_x` and `max_y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf'), `white_pixels` must contain at least 1 element, `(x, y)` is the first element in `white_pixels`**.
