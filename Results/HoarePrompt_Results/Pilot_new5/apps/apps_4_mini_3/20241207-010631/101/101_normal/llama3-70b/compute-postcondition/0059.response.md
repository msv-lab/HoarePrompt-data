According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, which means the loop cannot execute again because the range for `j` is from 0 to `m-1`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m+1`, which is outside the current range and makes the loop unable to run.

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` must be less than `m`**
