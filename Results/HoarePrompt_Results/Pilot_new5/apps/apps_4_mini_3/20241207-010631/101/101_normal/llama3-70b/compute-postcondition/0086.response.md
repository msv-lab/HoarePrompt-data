The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element at the position `pixels[i][j]`, where `i` is 2 and `j` is 2. The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged since the code only affects the `pixels` array. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that the value in `pixels` has been updated.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `pixels[2][2]` is '.'**
