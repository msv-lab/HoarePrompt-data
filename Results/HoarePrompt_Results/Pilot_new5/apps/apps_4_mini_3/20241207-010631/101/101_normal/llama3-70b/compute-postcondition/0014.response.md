The code calculates the `frame_size` by taking the maximum difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the previous state, and then adding 1. The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` determine the calculation. 

If `white_pixels` is empty, `min_x` and `min_y` would be float('inf'), while `max_x` and `max_y` would be float('-inf'). The calculation of `frame_size` in such a case would be:
```
frame_size = max(float('-inf') - float('inf'), float('-inf') - float('inf')) + 1
```
This results in `frame_size` being effectively float('inf'). 

If `white_pixels` contains elements, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` would have finite values. The `frame_size` would then represent a positive integer based on those values.

Output State: **`min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`**.
