The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the values of `top` and `bottom` will both now be equal to `n`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` and `right` are defined accordingly, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` and `right` are defined accordingly, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
