According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1, while `m` is greater than or equal to 1. 

If we consider the loop, the variable `j` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `m - 1`. Therefore, after the last iteration, `j` would be equal to `m - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m`, which means the current value of `j` should be `m - 1` at the end of the last iteration.

Thus, the updated state will reflect these changes:
- `i` will remain 1, as the loop variable `i` does not change within this loop.
- `j` will be set to `m` for the next iteration.
- The conditions for `m` are already satisfied because `m` is greater than or equal to 1, so we do not need to modify that condition.

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`**
