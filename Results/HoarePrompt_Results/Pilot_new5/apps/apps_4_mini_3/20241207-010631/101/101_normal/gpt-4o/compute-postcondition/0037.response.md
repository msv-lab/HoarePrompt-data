The variables `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is equal to 2, both `left` and `right` will have the value of 2 after execution. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` must be greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 2, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is 2, `right` is 2**
