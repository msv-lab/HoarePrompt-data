The code `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The initial state indicates that `i` is equal to `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000. Therefore, after executing this code, both `top` and `bottom` will take on the value of `n`. 

The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2**
