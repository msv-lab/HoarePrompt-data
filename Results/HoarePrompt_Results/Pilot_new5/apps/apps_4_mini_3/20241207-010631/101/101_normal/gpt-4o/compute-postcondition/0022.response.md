According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since `j` starts at 0, for the next iteration, `j` will be 1. The loop can still execute because `m` is given to be at least 1 and at most 2000. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 1**
