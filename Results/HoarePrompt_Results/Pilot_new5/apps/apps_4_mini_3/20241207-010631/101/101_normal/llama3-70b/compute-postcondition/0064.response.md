Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is less than `m`. If `pixels[i][j]` was originally `'.'` and either `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y`, `max_y`, then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'+'`. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` remains `'.'`.***
