Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements stated in the problem description. 

### Issues:

1. **Frame Size Validation**: The program checks if the `frame_height` and `frame_width` are less than 2, and returns -1 in those cases. However, it should allow for a frame size of 1 (the smallest valid frame) if there are white pixels that can be part of a frame. The frame can be a single pixel when there is only one 'w' present.

2. **Edge Cases for Frames**: The program does not account for scenarios where the 'w' pixels need a frame of size 1. For instance, if there is only one 'w' present, the output should be that single pixel marked appropriately, but the current implementation would return -1.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output should include the `+` characters for the frame, but it should also ensure that adjacent 'w' pixels are preserved. The implementation seems to focus on transforming all edge pixels without validating if they meet the criteria of being part of a frame.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
2 2
w.
..
```
The expected output should be:
```
w+
.+
```
However, the program would incorrectly output -1 because it does not recognize that a frame of size 1 is possible.

Due to these shortcomings, the program fails to account for all specified cases in the problem description, leading to its classification as incorrect.
