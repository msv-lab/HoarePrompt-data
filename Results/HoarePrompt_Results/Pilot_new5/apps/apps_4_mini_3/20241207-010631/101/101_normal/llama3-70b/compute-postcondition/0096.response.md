The code `print(''.join(row))` combines all characters in the variable `row` into a single string and prints it. The variable `row` is assumed to represent a row of pixels in the `pixels` list, and since `i` is `n`, the row being processed is the `n`-th row of the `pixels` list. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only pertains to the output.

Since the initial state indicates that `pixels` includes at least one additional row beyond the current `n` rows processed, the output only pertains to the printing of that specific row.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are valid coordinates from `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `pixels` is a list where each row is joined into a single string for printing, `i` is `n`, `j` can range from 0 to `m-1`, and the row `row` corresponding to `pixels[i]` has been printed as a single string.**
