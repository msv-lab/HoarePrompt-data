To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is iterating over `j` in the range of `m`. This means that for each iteration of the loop, `j` will take on values from `0` to `m-1`.
   - Since the initial value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is `1`, the next value of `j` in the next iteration will be `2`.

2. **Determining the Conditions for Execution**:
   - The loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `m`. Since `j` is currently `1` and `m` is greater than or equal to `2`, the loop will execute again for `j = 2`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the bounds of the range defined by `m`.

3. **Adjusting the State Variables**:
   - Since `j` will increment to `2`, we need to update `j` in the state.
   - The other state variables (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged because the loop itself does not modify them directly.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The updated values for the state will reflect the increment of `j` to `2`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2.**
