Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', with `top`, `bottom` equal to `n`, `left` equal to 0, `right` equal to 0, `i` equal to `n`, and `j` equal to 0, with the current value of `screen[i][j]` being 'w'. If `top` is None, `top` is set to `n` and `bottom` is set to `n`. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, since `j` is not greater than `right`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain the same.***
