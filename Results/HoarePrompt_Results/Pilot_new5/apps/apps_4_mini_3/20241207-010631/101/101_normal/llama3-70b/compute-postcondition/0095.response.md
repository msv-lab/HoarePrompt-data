According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` list, which contains the rows to be iterated through. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, indicating that all rows in `pixels` have been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition for the loop to run must still be satisfied, which means there must be a row available to iterate over.

Since `i` is already `n`, the next iteration would imply that there are no more rows left in `pixels`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `pixels` must contain at least one more row than it currently has, meaning `n` must be incremented by 1, and the `i` would ideally reflect this new row count.

However, since `i` is `n`, and all rows have been processed, we cannot change `i` to be something other than `n` if we are to adhere to the existing state. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute again, we would require `pixels` to have at least `n + 1` rows, meaning that the loop must have the potential to run one more time if we are to consider an additional row. However, since `i` is currently `n` and there are no more rows to iterate, the next state will remain unchanged in terms of `i`. 

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are valid coordinates from `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `pixels` is a list where each row is joined into a single string for printing, `i` is `n`, and `j` can range from 0 to `m-1; pixels must include at least one additional row beyond the current `n` rows previously processed.**
