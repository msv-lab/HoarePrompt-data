The provided program aims to create a one-pixel-wide frame around the white pixels on a monitor, as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads the resolution of the monitor and the state of each pixel. It correctly identifies black pixels ('.') and white pixels ('w'). This accurately reflects the problem description's input format.

2. **Identifying White Pixels**:
   - It constructs a list of coordinates for all white pixels. This is crucial because the frame must encompass all these pixels, which aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Calculating Frame Boundaries**:
   - The program computes the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates from the list of white pixels. These coordinates define the smallest bounding box that can encompass all the white pixels. This is essential for creating the smallest frame possible.

4. **Frame Size Calculation**:
   - The frame size is calculated as the maximum of the length and width of the bounding box plus one. This correctly reflects the dimensions needed for the frame.

5. **Frame Size Validation**:
   - The program checks if the calculated frame size exceeds the monitor dimensions. If it does, it outputs `-1`, which is consistent with the requirement to not draw a frame that cannot fit on the screen.

6. **Frame Drawing**:
   - The program iterates over the pixel grid and modifies the appropriate edges (top, bottom, left, right) of the bounding box to replace black pixels with the '+' character, while leaving existing white pixels unchanged. This adheres strictly to the requirement of drawing the frame around the white pixels.

7. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the modified grid. It ensures that the output format is as specified in the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where there are no valid positions to draw a frame within the defined bounds, as seen in the fourth example where `-1` should be printed. However, the program will always find valid positions as long as there is at least one white pixel, because it is guaranteed by the problem description that at least one 'w' will exist.
- If the bounding box defined by the white pixels does not form a complete frame (for example, if all edges are covered by 'w' and no frame can be drawn), the program will not return `-1`. However, this situation is not possible under the problem's constraints since there will always be at least one white pixel, ensuring some frame can be drawn (even if it is just a 1-pixel frame).

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is sound and adheres closely to the requirements outlined in the problem description. It effectively manages to draw the correct frame around the white pixels and handles edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
