Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is the minimum row index of the first encountered 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `i` remains equal to `n`, and `j` is equal to `m - 1` after all iterations of the loop have finished.**
