The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. The previous value of `bottom` is unknown, and the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that `m` > 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 2, and `bottom` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that `m` > 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 2, and `bottom` is equal to `i`.**
