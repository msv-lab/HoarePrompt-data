The function `func` does not accept any input arguments. It operates on a predefined monitor resolution represented as a pair of integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each, where each character is either a '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). The function's main output is generated based on the presence of white pixels in this pixel grid. It will return specific results based on the arrangement or presence of these pixels, but it is guaranteed that at least one pixel is white. 

Functionality: **The function does not take any input arguments and processes a monitor resolution defined by a pixel grid of black and white pixels, guaranteeing at least one white pixel is present.**
