According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `left`, and `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `left + 1`, which means `j` is currently one position to the right of `left`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than or equal to `right`. So if `j` is incremented, it will become `left + 2`. 

Additionally, since `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can continue executing as long as `j` does not exceed `right`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be equal to `left + 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`, `bottom` is greater than `top`, `i` is equal to `top + 2`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is equal to `left + 2`.**
