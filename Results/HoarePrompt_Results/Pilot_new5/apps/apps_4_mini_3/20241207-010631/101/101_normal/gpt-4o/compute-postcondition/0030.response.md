Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', and `j` is 1. If `j` is less than `left`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
