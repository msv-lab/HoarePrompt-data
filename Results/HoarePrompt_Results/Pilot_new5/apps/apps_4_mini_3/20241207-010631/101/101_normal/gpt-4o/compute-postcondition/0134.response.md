The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. The value of `n` is within the range of 1 to 2000. Therefore, `top` takes on the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is equal to `n`; `bottom` is `n`; `left` remains unchanged; `right` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to `n`; `j` is equal to `m + 1**
