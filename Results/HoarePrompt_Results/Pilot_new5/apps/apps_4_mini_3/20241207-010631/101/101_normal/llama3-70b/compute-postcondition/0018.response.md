In order for the loop `for i in range(n):` to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1. The other variables (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size`) do not influence the ability of the loop to execute directly but provide context for the iterations.

1. **Check the condition for `n`:** The loop will execute if `n > 0`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.
2. **Initialize `i`:** Before the loop starts, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0 as that is the starting index for the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and we also recognize that `i` will start at 0.

State: **`min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
