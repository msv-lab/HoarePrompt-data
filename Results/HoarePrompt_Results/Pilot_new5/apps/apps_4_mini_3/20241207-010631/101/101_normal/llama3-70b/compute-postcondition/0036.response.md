The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array. The variable `j` is defined as `m + 1`, which is one more than `m`. The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `pixels[i][j]`.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `j` is `m + 1`; `pixels[i][j]` is now `'+'`.**
