Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `m`. If either `i` is equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[1][m]` is '.', then `pixels[1][m]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[1][m]` equals 'w', we skip to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, `pixels[1][m]` is set to '.'***
