According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the list `white_pixels` must contain at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 elements, and `(x, y)` is the second element in the list. This means that for the loop to run one more time, we need to consider the next element in the `white_pixels` list.

If `(x, y)` is the second element, that means the next iteration will process the third element, which means `x` and `y` will be assigned the values of the third element in the `white_pixels` list. The iteration index will increase by 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `white_pixels` must contain at least 3 elements, and `(x, y)` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`min_x` is the lesser of `x` and `min_x`, `min_y` is the lesser of `y` and `min_y`, `max_x` is max(max_x, x), `max_y` is max(max_y, y), `white_pixels` must contain at least 3 elements, and `(x, y)` is the third element in `white_pixels`.**
