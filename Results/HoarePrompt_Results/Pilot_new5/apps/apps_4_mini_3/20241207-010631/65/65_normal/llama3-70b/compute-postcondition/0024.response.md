The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of balloons, constrained to be between 1 and 100. The parameter `k` is also an integer representing the number of friends, also constrained to be between 1 and 100. The parameter `s` is a string of lowercase letters with a length of `n`, representing the colors of the balloons. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the distribution of balloon colors among friends. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a string `s`, and then return a result based on the distribution of balloon colors to friends. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), k (integer), and s (string), and returns a result based on the distribution of balloon colors among friends.**
