Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `color` is the first character of `s`, and `color_count` is a dictionary. If `color` is already in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `color_count` is updated to include `color` as a key with the value 1.***
