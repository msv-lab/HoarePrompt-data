Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program begins by reading the two integers `n` (the number of balloons) and `k` (the number of friends) from input, followed by reading the string `s` that contains the colors of the balloons. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Counting Balloon Colors**: The program uses a dictionary (`color_count`) to count the occurrences of each color in the string `s`. This is necessary to determine how many balloons of each color need to be distributed, which corresponds to the requirement that no friend should receive more than one balloon of the same color.

3. **Distribution Check**: After counting the colors, the program checks if any color appears more than `k` times. The logic here is that if any balloon color exceeds the number of friends `k`, it implies that at least one friend would receive at least two balloons of that color, which would upset them. Thus, if any count in `color_count` exceeds `k`, it sets the `can_distribute` flag to `False`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints "YES" if all colors can be distributed without upsetting any friend (i.e., `can_distribute` is `True`), and "NO" otherwise. This is exactly what the problem description requests.

All edge cases, such as the minimum and maximum bounds for `n` and `k`, have been taken into consideration because the program operates under the constraints of `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100`, as specified.

Therefore, since the program meets all of the criteria set forth in the problem description and handles the input/output requirements as specified, it is correct.
