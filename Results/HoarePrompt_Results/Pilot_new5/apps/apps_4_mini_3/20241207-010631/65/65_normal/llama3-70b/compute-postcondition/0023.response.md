Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers; `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase letters; `color_count` is a dictionary where the keys are unique characters from `s` and the values are their counts; if `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if `max_color_count` is greater than `k`, 'NO' has been printed.***
