The function accepts two positive integers `n` (number of balloons) and `k` (number of friends), and a string `s` representing the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color and checks if any color count exceeds `k`. If all color counts are less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', indicating the balloons can be distributed among friends without exceeding their limit. If any color count exceeds `k`, it prints 'NO', indicating that the distribution is not possible. The function does not return any values, it only prints the result.
