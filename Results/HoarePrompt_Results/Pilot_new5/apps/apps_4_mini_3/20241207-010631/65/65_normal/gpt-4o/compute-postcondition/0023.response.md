Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` must not be empty, `can_distribute` is True. If `count` is greater than `k`, then `can_distribute` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the state.***
