Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to reach either end of the segment defined by `l` and `r` from the current position `pos`. If the entire segment (from 1 to n) is covered (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), it prints 0. If `l` is 1, it prints the distance to `r` plus one. If `r` is `n`, it prints the distance to `l` plus one. If both `l` and `r` are between their respective bounds, it computes the minimum distance to move to both ends of the segment and prints that value.**
