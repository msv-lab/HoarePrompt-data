The `print(ans)` statement outputs the current value of `ans`. The variable `ans` has been updated previously as `ans + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`, but the exact value of `ans` before the print statement is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `ans` is printed.**
