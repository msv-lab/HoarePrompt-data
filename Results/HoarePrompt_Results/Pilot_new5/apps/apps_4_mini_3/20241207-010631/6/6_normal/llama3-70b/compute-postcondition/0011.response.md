Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters: `n` (between 1 and 100), `pos` (between 1 and `n`), `l` (between 1 and `n`), and `r` (between `l` and `n`). It calculates the total distance that `pos` needs to move to fit within the range `[l, r]`. The result is printed but not returned, and the calculation includes cases where `pos` is less than `l`, greater than `r`, in addition to adjustments based on the minimum and maximum values to determine how far `pos` is from the bounds defined by `l` and `r`.**
