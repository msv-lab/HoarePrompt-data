The code initializes `ans` to 0. Since `ans` is the only variable affected by this code, the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The previous state of `ans` is not specified, but it will now be 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `ans` is 0.**
