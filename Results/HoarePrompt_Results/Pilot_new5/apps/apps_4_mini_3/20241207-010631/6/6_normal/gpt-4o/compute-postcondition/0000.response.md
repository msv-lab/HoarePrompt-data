Given the initial state and the code snippet, we analyze the impact as follows:

1. The code `n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user and splits it into four integer values which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`.
2. The variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` will take on new integer values based on the user's input, while they must still satisfy the conditions provided in the initial state where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`.

Since the exact input values are not provided, we denote that they will be updated but do not specify their exact values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, and `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are updated to new integer values based on user input.**
