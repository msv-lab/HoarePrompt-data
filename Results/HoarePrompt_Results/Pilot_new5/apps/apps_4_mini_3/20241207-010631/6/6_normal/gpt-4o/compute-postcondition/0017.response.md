The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. All parameters are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, and 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. After executing the function body, the function performs operations based on these parameters and returns a specific output. However, since the output behavior is not described, we cannot state what the explicit return value is. Therefore, without additional information on the output conditions, we can only describe the parameter acceptance.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, pos, l, and r, which are all integers within the specified constraints.**
