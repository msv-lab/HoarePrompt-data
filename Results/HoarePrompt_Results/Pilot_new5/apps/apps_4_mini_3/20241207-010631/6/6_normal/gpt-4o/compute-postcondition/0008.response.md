The code snippet prints the value of `abs(pos - l) + 1`. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged because the operation does not assign any new values to them; it only computes a value and prints it. The value of the expression `abs(pos - l) + 1` is calculated based on the existing values of `pos` and `l`. 

Since the output of the print statement does not alter the state of the program, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with an indication of the calculated expression.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, `r` is equal to `n`, and the expression computed is `abs(pos - l) + 1`.**
