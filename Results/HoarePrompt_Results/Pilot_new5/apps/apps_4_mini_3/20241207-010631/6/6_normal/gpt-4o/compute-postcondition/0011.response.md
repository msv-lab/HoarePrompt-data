The variable `move_to_r` is assigned the value of `abs(pos - r)`, which calculates the absolute difference between the current position `pos` and the position `r`. The value of `move_to_r` is now determined by the values of `pos` and `r`, but since `pos` is between 1 and `n`, and `r` is between `l` and `n`, we can conclude that `move_to_r` will always be a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, and `move_to_l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, `r` is less than `n`, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, and `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`.**
