To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Program Overview:
The program attempts to minimize the cost of changing the lengths of sticks so that they are "almost good" for some integer `t`. For each possible value of `t` (from 1 to 100), it calculates the cost of adjusting each stick's length to make it "almost good" (within 1 unit of `t`).

### Logic Breakdown:
1. For every integer `t` in the range [1, 100]:
   - It initializes `current_cost` to calculate the total cost of changing all sticks to be almost good for `t`.
   - For each stick length `length`:
     - If `length < t - 1`: The cost to change `length` to `t - 1` is added to `current_cost`.
     - If `length > t + 1`: The cost to change `length` to `t + 1` is added to `current_cost`.
   - If the `current_cost` for the current `t` is lower than the previously recorded `min_cost`, it updates `min_cost` and `best_t`.

2. Finally, it prints the best `t` and the minimum cost.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not account for the case when length is already "almost good" for `t` (i.e., within the range `[t-1, t+1]`). In this case, no cost should be incurred, but the program does not account for that scenario.
- If `length` is within the range `[t-1, t+1]`, there is no action needed, which means the code should not add any cost in this situation. The program fails to consider this.

### Test Case Example:
Consider the input:
```
3
2 3 4
```
- For `t = 3`, the sticks `2`, `3`, and `4` are almost good for `t` as:
  - `|2 - 3| = 1`
  - `|3 - 3| = 0`
  - `|4 - 3| = 1`
- The total cost should be `0` because transforming `2` to `3` and `4` to `3` incurs a cost of `2` but they can also remain `3` and incur no cost if `t = 3`.
- However, the program will incorrectly add costs for `lengths` that are already in the range, leading to incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the case where sticks are already "almost good" for some `t`, resulting in a potentially incorrect minimum cost and `t`. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
