To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to closely analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires us to find a positive integer `t` such that all stick lengths are "almost good" for `t`, which means the absolute difference between each stick length and `t` can be at most 1. The total cost of modifying the stick lengths should also be minimized.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Input Handling and Sorting**:
   - The program reads `n` and the lengths of sticks, and sorts the lengths. Sorting is a valid approach for finding a median (or near median) value that minimizes costs.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The initial cost is calculated using the median value (`mid`), which is a good starting point to minimize changes.

3. **Checking `t` Values**:
   - The program checks for potential `t` values starting from `mid - 1` to `1` and from `mid + 1` to `100`. For each `t`, it computes the cost of changing stick lengths to be almost good for that `t`.

4. **Selecting Minimum Cost**:
   - The program updates the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` whenever a lower cost is found.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Range of `t`**:
   - The program checks values of `t` in the range `[1, 100]`, which may miss optimal `t` values outside this range. In particular, if the maximum stick length is `100`, then `t = 101` should also be considered as it may yield a lower total cost when all lengths are adjusted upwards.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program should handle the case where all stick lengths are already equal. For example, if all sticks are `50`, the minimum cost should be `0` for `t = 50`.

3. **Behavior for Sticks of Length 1**:
   - If `n = 1` and the only stick is of length `1`, the output should ideally be `1 0`, but the logic should be verified to ensure it handles this correctly.

### Test Cases:

1. **Test with Sticks of Length 100**:
   ```
   Input:
   3
   100 100 100
   ```
   Expected Output:
   ```
   100 0
   ```
   Since all sticks are already `100`, no cost should be incurred.

2. **Test with Minimum Stick Length**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   1
   ```
   Expected Output:
   ```
   1 0
   ```
   Since we have only one stick of length `1`, no cost should be incurred.

3. **Test with Sticks Length More than Maximum Allowed by Program**:
   ```
   Input:
   2
   99 100
   ```
   Expected Output:
   ```
   100 0
   ```
   By setting `t` to `100`, both sticks are already almost good.

### Conclusion:

Given the potential issues where the program does not consider `t` values outside the range of `1` to `100`, it may yield incorrect results when `t` should be larger than `100` for sticks of maximum length. Thus, the program doesn't cover all edge cases as required.

Correctness: **False**.
