Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `length` is `a[i + 1]`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`. If `length` is between `t - 1` and `t + 1`, `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
