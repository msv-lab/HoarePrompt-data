Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is updated based on `length`. If `length` is greater than 102, `current_cost` becomes the previous value of `current_cost` plus `length - 102`. `min_cost` retains its updated value, `best_t` retains its updated value, `t` remains 101, and `length` is the second element in `a`, with `a` containing at least 2 elements.***
