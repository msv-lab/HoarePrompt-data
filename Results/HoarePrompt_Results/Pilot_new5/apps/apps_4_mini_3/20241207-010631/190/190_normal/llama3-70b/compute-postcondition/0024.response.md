Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`; `min_cost` is the minimum cost computed over all values of `i` from `mid - 1` down to 1; `min_t` is the value of `i` that resulted in `min_cost`; `t` remains equal to the original value of `mid`.**
