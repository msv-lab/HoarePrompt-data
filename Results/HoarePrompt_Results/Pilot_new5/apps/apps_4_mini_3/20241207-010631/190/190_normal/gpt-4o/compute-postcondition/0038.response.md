Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100`, and `length` is the first element in the list `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`.***
