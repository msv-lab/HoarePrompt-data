The code assigns the value of `current_cost` to `min_cost`. Since it is stated that the current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, this means that `min_cost` will now hold the value of `current_cost`, which is a lower value than it previously had. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_cost` is the total adjustment based on all `length` values in `a`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` retains its updated value, `t` is 101, `length` is the last element in `a`.**
