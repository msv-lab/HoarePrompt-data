Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100`, and `length` is equal to `a[n]`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.***
