The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. Since `cost` is defined as a non-negative integer equal to `sum(min(abs(x - 100), abs(x - 99)) for x in sticks)`, the value of `min_cost` will also be equal to this sum. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` must be less than 100; `i` is equal to 100; `cost` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(min(abs(x - 100), abs(x - 99)) for x in sticks); `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
