Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s an explanation of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths `a`, fulfilling the input requirements stipulated in the problem.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program iteratively evaluates possible target lengths `t` from 1 to 100:
   - For each stick length in `a`, it calculates the adjustment cost based on whether the length is less than `t - 1` (in which case it needs to be increased) or greater than `t + 1` (in which case it needs to be decreased).
   - This accurately reflects the definition of "almost good" sticks, where a stick length is considered almost good for some integer `t` if its length is within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]`.

3. **Tracking Minimum Cost**: The program maintains a variable `min_cost` to track the minimum adjustment cost across all evaluated values of `t`, and updates `best_t` accordingly. This ensures that the optimal target `t` that minimizes the total cost is correctly identified.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the best value of `t` found along with the corresponding minimum cost, which is in line with the output requirements stated in the problem description.

Since the program systematically explores all valid target values for `t`, calculates the associated costs accurately, and selects the best solution, it adheres to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the implementation is correct, and it should work for all cases within the specified constraints.
