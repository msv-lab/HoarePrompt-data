Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is at least 98; `i` is equal to `mid + 2`; if `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to equal `cost`, and `min_t` is updated to equal `i`.***
