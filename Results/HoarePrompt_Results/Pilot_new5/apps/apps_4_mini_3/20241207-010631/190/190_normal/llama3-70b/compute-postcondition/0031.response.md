According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and its relationship with `mid`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to 100. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is less than or equal to 99, `i` must be between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1, which means `i` will become `mid + 2`. Hence, to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to 100, which means `mid` should be at least 98.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` must be at least 98; `i` is equal to `mid + 2`; `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks.**
