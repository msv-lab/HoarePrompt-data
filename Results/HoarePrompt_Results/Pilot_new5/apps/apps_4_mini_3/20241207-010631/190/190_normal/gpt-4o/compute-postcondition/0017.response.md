Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `length` is the next integer in the list `a` (if available); `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))` if `length` is greater than `t + 1`. If `length` is not greater than `t + 1`, the value of `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
