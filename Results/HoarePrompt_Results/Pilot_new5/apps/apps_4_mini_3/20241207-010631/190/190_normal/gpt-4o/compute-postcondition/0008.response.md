The statement `current_cost += t - 1 - length` indicates that `current_cost` is being increased by the value of `t - 1 - length`. The initial state specifies that `length` is the first integer in the list `a`, and it is given that its current value is less than `t - 1`. Therefore, `t - 1 - length` is a positive integer, and `current_cost` will increase by this value.

However, the actual values of `t`, `current_cost`, and the specific value of `length` are not provided in the initial state. Thus, while we understand the operation and how it affects `current_cost`, we cannot state the final value of `current_cost`.

The output state should indicate that `current_cost` has been updated, along with the relationship between `length` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `length` is the first integer in the list `a`, `length` is less than `t - 1`, and `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`.**
