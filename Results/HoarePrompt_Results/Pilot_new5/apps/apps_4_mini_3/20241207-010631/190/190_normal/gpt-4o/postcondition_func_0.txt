The function accepts an integer `n`, which indicates the number of integers in a list, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). It calculates the minimum adjustment cost required to transform the lengths in `a` such that they are all within one unit of an optimal target `t` (where t varies from 1 to 100). The function returns the optimal value of `t` that results in the minimum cost along with that minimum cost.
