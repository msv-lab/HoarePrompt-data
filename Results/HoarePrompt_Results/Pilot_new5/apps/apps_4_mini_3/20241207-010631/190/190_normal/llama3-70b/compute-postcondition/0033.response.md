The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `cost` is defined as the sum of `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`, while `i` is defined as `mid + 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is at least 98; `i` is equal to `mid + 2`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is at least 98; `i` is equal to `mid + 2`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
