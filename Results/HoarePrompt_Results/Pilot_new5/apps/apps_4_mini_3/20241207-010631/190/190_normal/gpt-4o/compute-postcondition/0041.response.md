The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to its previous value. The value of `length` is the last element of the list `a`, which has `n` integers, indicating that `a` contains at least `n + 1` elements. Therefore, the value of `length` is available. The previous value of `t` is not specified, but it is used in the calculation to determine how much is added to `current_cost`.

Since `current_cost` is modified through the expression, the output state reflects the updated value of `current_cost` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100`, `length` is the last element in the list `a`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.**
