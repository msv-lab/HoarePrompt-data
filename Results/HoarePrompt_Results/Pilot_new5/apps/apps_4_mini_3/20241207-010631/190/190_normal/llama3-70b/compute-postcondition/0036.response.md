According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and the upper bound of the range. The loop is set to iterate from `mid + 1` to `101`. Given that `mid` is at least `98`, the starting value for `i` will be at least `99`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mid + 2`, which is at least `100`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `101`, and since the range is exclusive of `101`, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `mid` must be adjusted such that `mid + 1` is less than `101`. This means `mid` should be less than `100`, allowing `i` to take the value of `100` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` must be less than 100; `i` is equal to 100; `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to equal `cost`, and `min_t` is updated to equal `i`.**
