Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is less than or equal to 99; `i` is initialized to `mid + 1`; `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
