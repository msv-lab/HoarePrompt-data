The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding the result of `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `t` is 101, we can calculate `t + 1` as 102. Therefore, `current_cost` will be incremented by `length - 102`. The value of `length` is greater than 102, which means `length - 102` will be a positive value.

Other variables (`min_cost`, `best_t`, and `a`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`current_cost` is equal to 0 plus (length - 102), `min_cost` retains its updated value, `best_t` retains its updated value, `t` is 101, `length` is the first element in `a`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, the value of `length` is greater than or equal to 100, and the current value of `length` is greater than 102.**
