Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, and `length` is the first integer in the list `a` which is greater than or equal to `t - 1`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`.***
