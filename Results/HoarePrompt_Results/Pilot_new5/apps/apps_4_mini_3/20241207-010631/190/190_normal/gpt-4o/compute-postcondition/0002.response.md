The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This indicates that `min_cost` is now a placeholder for a minimum cost value that will eventually be calculated based on the other variables, but at this point, it is set to a value that represents "no cost" or an infinitely large cost. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is float('inf')**
