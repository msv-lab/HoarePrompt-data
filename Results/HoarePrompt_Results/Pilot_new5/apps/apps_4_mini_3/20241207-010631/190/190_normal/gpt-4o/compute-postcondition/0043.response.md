Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100`, `length` is the last element in the list `a`, and `a` must have at least `n + 1` elements. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.***
