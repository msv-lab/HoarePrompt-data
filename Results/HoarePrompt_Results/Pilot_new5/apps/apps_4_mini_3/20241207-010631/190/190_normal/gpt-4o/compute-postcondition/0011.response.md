To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, we note the following:

- `current_cost` is a variable that will be updated by adding the result of the expression `length - (t + 1)` to its current value.
- `length` is the first integer in the list `a`, which is a positive integer such that `1 <= length <= 100`. 
- We also know that the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`, meaning `length - (t + 1)` will yield a positive value.

Since we don't have the specific values of `current_cost`, `length`, and `t`, we will state the output in terms of these variables.

After executing the code, the following will hold true:

- The value of `current_cost` increases by `length - (t + 1)`, which is a positive integer.
- The other variables (`n`, `a`, `length`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `length` is the first integer in the list `a` which is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`, and `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`.**
