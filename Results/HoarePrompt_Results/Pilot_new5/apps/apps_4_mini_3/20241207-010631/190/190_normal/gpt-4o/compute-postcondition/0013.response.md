Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, and `length` is the first integer in the list `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`.***
