The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\). The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer \(a_i\) is also a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). 

The function's behavior is not detailed in the output, so we cannot specify what it returns based solely on the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers, with specified constraints on their values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers, with constraints that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each integer in the list.**
