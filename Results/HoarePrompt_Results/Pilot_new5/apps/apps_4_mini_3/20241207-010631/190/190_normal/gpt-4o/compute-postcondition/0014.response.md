According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `a`, and the variable `length` takes each value from the list in turn. The loop will execute again for the next integer in the list `a`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `length` is currently set to the last integer in the list `a`. Since the for loop iterates over each element, to execute one more time, `length` must be set to the next integer in the list `a`. Therefore, if `length` refers to the last element for the current iteration, and given that the list `a` has `n` integers (with indices from 0 to n-1), for the loop to execute again, we assume that the next value of `length` will be the next integer in the list.

To summarize:
- `length` needs to be adjusted to the next integer in the list `a`. If `length` is currently the last element in the list, then we need to ensure that `length` is now at the next index (which is not possible if we are at the last element).

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `length` is the next integer in the list `a` (if available), which means an index must be less than `n`, and `current_cost` is defined based on the current value of `length`.**
