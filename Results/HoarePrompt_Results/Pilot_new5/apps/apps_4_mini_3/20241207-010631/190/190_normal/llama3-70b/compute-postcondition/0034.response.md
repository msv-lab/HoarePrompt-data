The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently equal to `mid + 2`. The previous state indicates that `mid` is at least 98, thus `i` can be at least 100. The values of `n`, `a`, `sticks`, and `min_cost` remain unchanged, as the assignment only affects `min_t`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is at least 98; `i` is equal to `mid + 2`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `mid + 2`.**
