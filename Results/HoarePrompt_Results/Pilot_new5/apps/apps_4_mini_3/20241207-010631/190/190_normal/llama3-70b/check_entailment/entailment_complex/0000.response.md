Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. 

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Definition of "Almost Good":** The problem states that a stick length \( a_i \) is called almost good for some integer \( t \) if \( |a_i - t| \leq 1 \). This means that for a stick to be considered almost good for \( t \), its adjusted length must be either \( t-1 \), \( t \), or \( t+1 \).

2. **Cost Calculation:** The program calculates the cost of changing the sticks' lengths to values of \( t \) using the median of the sticks. However, the algorithm does not check whether the adjusted lengths fall within the criteria for being "almost good." The program only ensures that lengths are adjusted to be as close as possible to \( t \) but does not consider the constraint of \( |a_i - t| \leq 1 \).

3. **Range of \( t \):** The program computes costs for \( t \) values from \( mid - 1 \) to 1 and \( mid + 1 \) to 100. However, this approach may not find the optimal \( t \) because it is focused on the median and does not explore all potential values of \( t \) that could minimize the costs under the "almost good" constraint.

4. **Failure in Representation of Results:** The final output should include a \( t \) that makes all sticks "almost good," but the program does not guarantee that the resulting \( t \) will allow all sticks to satisfy the condition \( |a_i - t| \leq 1 \).

Thus, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases, particularly in ensuring sticks are almost good for the selected \( t \) after adjustments.
