The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous states of the variables are unaffected, except for `min_t`, which now holds the value of `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we will only refer to the variable `min_t` and its relation to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is 2; `cost` is computed as the sum of `min(abs(x - 1), abs(x - 2)) for x in sticks; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `i`.**
