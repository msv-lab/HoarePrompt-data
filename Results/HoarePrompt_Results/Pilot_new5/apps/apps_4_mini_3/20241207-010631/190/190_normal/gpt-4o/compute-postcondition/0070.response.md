To analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Understanding current_cost**: 
   - If `length` is less than 100, then `current_cost` is `200 - length`.
   - If `length` is greater than or equal to 100, then `current_cost` is `-2`.

2. **Calculating the new current_cost**:
   - The code `current_cost += t - 1 - length` will adjust `current_cost` by adding the value of `t - 1 - length` to it.
   - Given that `t` is 101, `t - 1` becomes 100. 
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `current_cost += 100 - length`.

3. **Impact of the code**: 
   - Depending on whether `length` is less than or greater than/equal to 100, we can see how `current_cost` changes.
   - If `length` is less than 100:
     - `current_cost` before the operation: `200 - length`.
     - After the operation: `current_cost += 100 - length`, which gives `current_cost = (200 - length) + (100 - length) = 300 - 2*length`.
   - If `length` is greater than or equal to 100:
     - `current_cost` before the operation: `-2`.
     - After the operation: `current_cost += 100 - length`, which gives `current_cost = -2 + (100 - length) = 98 - length`.

Now, we summarize the output state according to the possible values of `length`:

- If `length` is less than 100: 
  - `current_cost` is `300 - 2 * length`.
- If `length` is greater than or equal to 100: 
  - `current_cost` is `98 - length`.

Since both cases are valid depending on the value of `length`, we will present them in the output state.

Output State: **`min_cost` retains its updated value, `best_t` retains its updated value, `t` is 101, `length` is the third element in `a`, `current_cost` is either `300 - 2 * length` (if `length` is less than 100) or `98 - length` (if `length` is greater than or equal to 100).**
