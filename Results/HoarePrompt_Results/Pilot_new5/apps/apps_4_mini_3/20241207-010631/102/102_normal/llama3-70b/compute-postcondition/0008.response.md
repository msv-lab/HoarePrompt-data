The code snippet `exit()` is invoked, which causes the program to terminate immediately. No values of the variables have changed, but the execution of the program is halted, and nothing further will be computed or printed. The previous state of printed values and any messages is no longer relevant as the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, and the program has exited without further output.**
