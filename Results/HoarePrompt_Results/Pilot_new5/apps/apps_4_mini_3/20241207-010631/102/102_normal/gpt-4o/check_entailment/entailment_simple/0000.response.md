Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers from input: `n` (the total money Vasya has), `a` (the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola), and `b` (the cost of one Bars bar). Each of these inputs falls within the specified range (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000).

2. **Logic to Determine Purchasable Amounts**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through all possible quantities of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`), which can range from 0 to `n // a` (the maximum number of bottles Vasya can afford without exceeding his total money).
   - For each value of `x`, the program checks if it is possible to purchase a non-negative number of Bars bars (`y`) such that the total cost is exactly `n`. This is done using the condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, which determines if the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles can be exactly divided by the cost of a Bars bar.

3. **Output**:
   - If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found that satisfies the equation `x * a + y * b = n`, the program prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`.
   - If after checking all possible values of `x` no valid pair is found, the program prints "NO", indicating it is impossible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The program exhaustively checks all feasible combinations of `x` (bottles of Ber-Cola) within the limits set by `n` and `a`. 
   - The use of the modulo operation ensures that only valid combinations that lead to exact spending are considered. 
   - Therefore, the logic covers all possible scenarios, including when either `x` or `y` can be zero, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and handles all specified edge cases appropriately. Thus, the correctness of the implementation is confirmed.
