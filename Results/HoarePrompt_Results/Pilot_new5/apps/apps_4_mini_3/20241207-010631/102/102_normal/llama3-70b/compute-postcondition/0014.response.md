The code `exit()` is a command that terminates the program's execution immediately. It does not change any variable values but stops the execution flow. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the program has exited, and all previously defined values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, `x` is equal to `n // a + 1`, `y` is equal to `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b` and the program has exited.**
