The variable `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial conditions of `n` and `a` are unchanged, and `b` must satisfy the constraint that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000.**
