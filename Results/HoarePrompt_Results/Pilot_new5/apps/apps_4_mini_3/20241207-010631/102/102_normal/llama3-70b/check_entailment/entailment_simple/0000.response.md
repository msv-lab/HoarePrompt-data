The given annotated program aims to determine whether Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles by purchasing a combination of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. The program uses a loop to iterate through all possible quantities of Ber-Cola bottles (denoted as `x`) and calculates the corresponding quantity of Bars bars (denoted as `y`) that would exactly spend the remaining money.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, which correspond to the total money Vasya has, the cost of a bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of a Bars bar respectively. The constraints on these integers are respected (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000).

2. **Looping through possible values of x**:
   - The program iterates `x` from `0` to `n // a + 1`. This ensures that it considers all possible non-negative quantities of Ber-Cola bottles that Vasya can buy without exceeding his budget.
   
3. **Calculating y**:
   - For each value of `x`, it calculates `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`. This represents the maximum number of Bars bars Vasya can buy with the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles of Ber-Cola.
   
4. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `x * a + y * b == n`. If this condition is satisfied, it means that the chosen quantities of `x` and `y` are valid and meet the requirement of spending exactly `n` burles. The program prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y`.

5. **Output when no valid combination is found**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid combination of `x` and `y`, the program prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It systematically checks every possible combination of Ber-Cola bottles and Bars bars within the constraints of Vasya's total money. The approach ensures that all non-negative integer solutions for the equation \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \) are considered.

### Conclusion:

Since the program correctly implements the logic to find two non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \) or determine that it is impossible, it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
