Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, `x` is `n // a + 1`, and `y` is `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`. If `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, the condition holds true; otherwise, the condition does not hold, but the program does not change the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`.***
