The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It has three cases for its execution flow. In Case_1, the program returns nothing as there is no value specified after the `return` statement. In Case_2, the program also returns nothing as it completes execution without a return value. In Case_3, the program does not return any value because the 'return' statement is empty, and it simply completes execution without a return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to execute without accepting any parameters and to not return any value in any case.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value in any case.**
