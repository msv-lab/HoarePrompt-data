The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The variable `x` is currently equal to `1`, and `y` is calculated as `(n - a) // b`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `a` is an integer such that `1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000`. The state of the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` is unaffected by the print operation. 

Thus, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, along with the values that are printed for `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
