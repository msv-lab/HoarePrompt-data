Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000. The loop will iterate `n // a + 1` times, attempting to find non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. If such values are found, the program prints 'YES', `x` is a non-negative integer representing how many times `a` fits into `n`, and `y` is a non-negative integer representing how many times `b` fits into the remaining portion of `n`. If no such values are found after all iterations, the program terminates without printing anything.**
