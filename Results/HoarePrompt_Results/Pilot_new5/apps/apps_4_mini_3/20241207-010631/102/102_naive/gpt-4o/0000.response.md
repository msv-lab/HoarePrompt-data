To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The goal is to find non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that:

\[ x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \]

Where:
- `n` is the total amount of money.
- `a` is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.
- `b` is the cost of one Bars bar.

The program iterates through possible values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) and checks if the remaining money after buying `x` bottles can be exactly divided by the cost of Bars bars (`b`). If such a pair `(x, y)` is found, it outputs "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`. If no such combination exists after checking all possible `x`, it outputs "NO".

### Potential Issues
1. **Boundary Cases**: 
   - If `n` is less than both `a` and `b`, the loop will not execute, and the program will immediately print "NO", which is correct.
   - If `n` is equal to `a`, then the output will correctly be "YES" with `x = 1` and `y = 0`.
   - If `n` is equal to `b`, then the output will correctly be "YES" with `x = 0` and `y = 1`.

2. **Multiple solutions**: 
   - The program does confirm that if there are multiple solutions, it will print any of them, which is in line with the requirements.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The code iterates up to `n // a + 1` which is appropriate given the constraints, but this could be inefficient for large values of `n`, especially if `a` is relatively small compared to `n`. However, this does not affect correctness but rather affects performance.

### Conclusion
Upon examining different scenarios, the program correctly handles the problem requirements as specified. The logic for determining the values of `x` and `y` is sound and accounts for all possible combinations that satisfy the equation.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
