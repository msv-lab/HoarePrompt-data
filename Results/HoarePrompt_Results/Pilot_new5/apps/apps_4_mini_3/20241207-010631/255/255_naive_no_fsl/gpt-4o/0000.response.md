Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string, as stipulated by the problem description. The logic implemented counts the number of contiguous segments of differing characters but does not consider the possibility of deleting larger contiguous substrings of the same character in a single operation.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
aaabb
```
According to the problem description, we can delete the substring "aaa" in the first operation and then "bb" in the second operation, resulting in a total of 2 operations. However, the program will output 3 because it counts each segment of differing characters (the transition from 'a' to 'b' and back) rather than recognizing that 'aaa' can be removed in a single operation.

Hence, the program fails to handle this case and others like it correctly.
