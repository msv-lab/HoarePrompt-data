Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the problem's requirements correctly. The problem asks for the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string, where each operation consists of removing a contiguous substring of equal letters. 

The provided code simply counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string and adds one, which does not correspond to the correct number of operations needed to remove all characters. 

For example, consider the input "aaaabaaa". The correct number of operations is 2 (remove "aaaa" in one operation and then "a" in another). However, the program would output 5, as it would count each transition incorrectly.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem as required.
