The variable `operations` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `operations` is 2, so after the increment, its new value will be 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `operations`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `operations` is 3, `i` is 2**
