The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 500) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, then calculates and prints the number of distinct consecutive characters in the string `s`. The function does not handle the case where the length of the string is less than `n` or where `n` is not within the specified range, and it directly takes user input for `n` and `s`.
