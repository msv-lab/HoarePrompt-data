The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but it is now increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same, as they are unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is the user-entered string, `ans` is increased by 1**.
