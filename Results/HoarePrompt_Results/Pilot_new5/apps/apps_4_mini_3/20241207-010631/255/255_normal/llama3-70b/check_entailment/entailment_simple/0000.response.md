Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to delete the whole string by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. However, the program only counts the number of distinct consecutive characters in the string `s`, incrementing `ans` whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one.

This approach is incorrect because:

1. The number of distinct segments of characters does not correspond to the minimum number of operations needed. For instance, in the string "aaabaaa", the program would output `4` (due to transitions between 'a' and 'b' and back), but we can remove the entire string in just `2` operations: "aaa" and then "aaa".

2. The problem requires us to look for the possibility of removing contiguous substrings of equal letters, which may not directly correlate with the number of distinct segments counted by the program.

A correct approach would involve using dynamic programming to account for decisions made at each point in the string, considering the best way to group and remove contiguous equal characters. The current program fails to reflect that logic and does not solve the problem accurately. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
