#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is greater than `n`, `positions` contains all odd numbers starting from 1 up to the last valid odd number that is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 1000) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 <= k <= 1000). It calculates and prints all odd numbers starting from 1 up to the largest odd number that is less than or equal to `n`, considering a step size of `(2 * k + 1)` between consecutive odd numbers. It also prints the count of these odd numbers. The function does not return any value.
