The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Given that `i` is initially equal to `2 * k + 2`, the new value of `i` becomes:

i = (2 * k + 2) + (2 * k + 1) = 4 * k + 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least equal to `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is [1, `i`], and `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least equal to `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is [1, `i`], `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3**.
