The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer in the range from 0 to 1000, `2 * k` will range from `0` to `2000`, making `2 * k + 1` range from `1` to `2001`. The previous value of `i` is `1`, so the new value of `i` will be `1 + (2 * k + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * k + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is [1], `i` is equal to `2 * k + 2**.
