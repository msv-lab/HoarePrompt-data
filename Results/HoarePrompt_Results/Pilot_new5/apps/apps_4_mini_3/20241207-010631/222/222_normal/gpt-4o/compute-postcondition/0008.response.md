To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i <= n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `n` must be at least equal to `2 * k + 2`
- `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`

For the loop to execute again, the value of `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Thus, we need to ensure that:

\[ 4 * k + 3 \leq n \]

Given that `n` must be at least `2 * k + 2`, we compare the two expressions. 

1. We already know that `n` is at least `2k + 2`.
2. For `i` to be less than or equal to `n`, we substitute for `n`:
   - If `n = 2k + 2`, we have:
   \[ 4 * k + 3 \leq 2 * k + 2 \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[ 2k + 1 \leq 0 \]
   which is impossible since `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).

3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than `4 * k + 3`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k + 2`, it needs to be at least `4 * k + 4` to allow for `i` to be less than or equal to `n`.

Thus, we need to state that `n` must be at least equal to `4 * k + 4`.

No other states need adjustments.

State: **`n` must be at least equal to `4 * k + 4`, `positions` is [1, `i`], `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`**
