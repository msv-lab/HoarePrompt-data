To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code, the description, and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap
Miroslav wants to turn over all skewers numbered from 1 to n with the minimal number of actions. When he turns skewer number i, it affects k skewers on each side, resulting in the turning of skewers from i-k to i+k, inclusive. The task is to find the minimum number of actions required to turn all skewers and to output the positions of the skewers that should be turned.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)  # Calculate the minimum number of actions
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)  # Generate the positions to turn
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

1. **Calculation of Actions (`l`)**:
   - The formula `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` is used to calculate the number of actions needed. This formula effectively divides the total skewers by the total skewers affected in one action (which is `k * 2 + 1`).
   - This calculation appears correct for most cases as it encapsulates how many groups of skewers can be turned over in one action.

2. **Generating Results (`res`)**:
   - The loop `for i in range(l)` and the calculation `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` aims to generate the positions of the skewers to turn.
   - The starting position is always 1, and every subsequent position is offset by the total number of skewers turned per action (`k * 2 + 1`).

### Edge Cases
- **Case when `k = 0`**: 
  - Each turn only affects the skewer itself. In this case, the expected output should be equal to the number of skewers `n`, resulting in `l = n` and `res = [1, 2, ..., n]`.
- **Case when `n` is less than or equal to `k`**:
  - In this case, one action should suffice since all skewers can be turned in one go.
  
### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints state:
- The function calculates the number of actions needed and the positions of skewers to turn. If `n + k < 2`, it would lead to an empty list, but still output `l` as 0. However, for any valid input according to the problem description, this should not be a concern since the constraints ensure valid operations.

### Conclusion
The original code does handle various cases correctly:
- It computes the number of turns accurately.
- It generates the correct positions based on the number of skewers affected per action.

However, the output hints mention that if `n + k < 2`, the resulting list will be empty, and the function will still output `l` as 0. This scenario shouldn't occur because `n` must be at least 1 based on the problem constraints. This further validates that the code is aligned with the problem description.

Since no edge cases or potential failures have been identified based on the problem description, code, or output hints, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**.
