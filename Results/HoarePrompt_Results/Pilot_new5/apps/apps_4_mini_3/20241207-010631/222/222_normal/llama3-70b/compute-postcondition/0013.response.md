Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers from input: a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of skewers, and a non-negative integer `k` (0 <= k <= 1000) representing the number of skewers turned from each side during one action. It calculates how many actions are needed to turn all skewers, which is output as `l`, and generates a list of positions where the skewers are turned, starting from 1 and increasing by `(k * 2 + 1)` for each position. If `n + k < 2`, the resulting list will be empty, and the function will still output `l`, which in this case will be 0. The function prints `l` and the positions in the list `res` as space-separated values.**
