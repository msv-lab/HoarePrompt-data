`res` is a list initialized with the value `[1, k * 2 + 2]`. The code snippet appends a new value to the list `res`. The expression to calculate the new value is `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. Given that `i` is `2`, we can substitute it in:

1. Calculate `k * 2 + 1`: This is the previous value of `k` multiplied by `2`, increased by `1`.
2. Then multiply this result by `2` (the value of `i`).
3. Finally, add `1` to this product.

Thus, the new value to append to `res` is:
- New Value = `2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = 2 * k * 2 + 2 + 1 = 4k + 3`.

The existing list `res` is updated to include this new value. Therefore, the final state of `res` will be `[1, k * 2 + 2, 4k + 3]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000) such that `n + k >= 2`, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than 2, `res` is [1, k * 2 + 2, 4k + 3]**.
