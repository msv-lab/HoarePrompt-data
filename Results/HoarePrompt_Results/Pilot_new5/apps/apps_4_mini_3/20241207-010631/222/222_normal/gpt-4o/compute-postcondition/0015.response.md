Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 1000) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 <= k <= 1000). It calculates and prints all odd numbers starting from 1 up to the largest odd number that is less than or equal to `n`, considering a step size of `(2 * k + 1)` between consecutive odd numbers. It also prints the count of these odd numbers. The function does not return any value. **
