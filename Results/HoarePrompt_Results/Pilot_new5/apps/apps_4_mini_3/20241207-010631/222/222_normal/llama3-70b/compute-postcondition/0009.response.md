To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed fully, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the initial conditions provided.

The loop iterates `l` times where `l` is defined as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. 

This means that:
- If `n + k < 2`, `l` will be 0, and the loop will not execute at all. In this case, `res` will remain an empty list.
- If `n + k >= 2`, the loop will execute `l` times, appending values to `res` based on the formula `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.

After all iterations, the values in the `res` list will be:
- For `i` from `0` to `l-1`, the values will be `1`, `k * 2 + 2`, `4k + 3`, ..., up to the last element which will be `(l-1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. 

If the loop executes:
- The final `res` will contain `l` elements: 
  - The first element will always be `1`
  - Subsequent elements will be calculated using the given formula.
  
Thus:

If `l > 0`, the final output state will be:
- `n` is the input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), 
- `k` is the input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), 
- `l` is equal to `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, 
- `res` will be a list containing elements `[1, k * 2 + 2, 4k + 3, ..., (l-1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1]` 

If `l = 0`, then:
- `res` will remain an empty list.

Therefore, the overall output state is:

Output State: **if `n + k >= 2`, `n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is equal to (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is a list of length `l` containing elements [1, 3, 5, ..., (l-1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1]; if `n + k < 2`, `res` is an empty list.**
