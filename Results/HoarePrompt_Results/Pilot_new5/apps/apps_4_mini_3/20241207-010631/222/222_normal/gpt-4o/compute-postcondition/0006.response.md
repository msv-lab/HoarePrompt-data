`positions` is updated by appending the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `2 * k + 2`, the new state of `positions` will be `[1, i]`, where `i` is a specific value calculated based on `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least equal to `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is [1, `i`], `i` is equal to `2 * k + 2**
