The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `files`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that must satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The parameter `files` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string made up of digits and lowercase English letters, with a length ranging from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (a string that can be "1" for example tests or "0" for regular tests). The function returns a string `moves` that contains all the move operations performed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, and return a string representing the move operations performed based on the input. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, and returns a string containing all the move operations performed.**
