According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `n`, as well as the presence of `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`. The loop will execute again if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is currently `2 * n + 1`, it must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, which means `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n` or less.

Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must also be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` at the end of the last iteration is `2 * n + 1`, `str(2 * n + 1)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to continue.

Thus, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to `2 * n` (to satisfy the first condition) and ensure that `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`.

State: **`temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n` and `str(2 * n)` must be in `files_set`**
