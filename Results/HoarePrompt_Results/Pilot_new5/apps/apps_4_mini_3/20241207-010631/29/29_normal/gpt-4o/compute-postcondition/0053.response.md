According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `examples` list and the variable `i`. The loop will execute for `i` ranging from 0 to `len(examples) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last processed element in the `examples` list. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `examples[i]` is being compared to `str(i + 1)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `len(examples)` to indicate that it will attempt to access the next index.

However, since there are no valid indices beyond `len(examples) - 1`, the loop cannot execute again, and thus the loop condition becomes false.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` has been processed up to index `i`, and `i` is `len(examples)`**
