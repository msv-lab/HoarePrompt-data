To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we must consider the variables involved in the for loop. The loop iterates over `examples`, and its execution depends on whether `examples` contains any elements.

1. The variable `examples` is derived from the `files` list, where elements are filtered based on the second element of each tuple. For the loop to execute, `examples` must have at least one element.

2. Since `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, we need to ensure that there are tuples in `files` where the second element is equal to 1, so that `examples` can be populated.

3. The index `i` will start at 1 as specified by `enumerate(start=1)`.

Given these considerations, the required states for the loop to execute are as follows:

1. `files` must contain at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, so that `examples` is not empty.
2. `i` will start at 1.
3. `file` will be the first element of `examples`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `script` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `file` is the first element of `examples`**
