To analyze the conditions for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we have the following statements:

1. The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
2. From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, which means it can be at most `2 * n` for the loop to continue.
3. The condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` implies that `temp_counter` must also be a value for which the corresponding string representation is present in `files_set`.

Now, considering the conditions:
- Since `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` for the loop to execute and it currently must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, it seems that for the loop to execute another iteration we need to ensure `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n`.
- The `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, which means `temp_counter` must also be within that range for its string representation to be found in `files_set`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` falls within the valid range. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
1. `temp_counter` needs to be at most `2 * n`.
2. `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be at least `n + 1` to ensure its string representation is within `files_set`.

The other states like `files_set`, `examples`, `regulars`, `i`, `moves`, and `target` can remain unchanged as they do not directly affect the loop's ability to run again.

State: **`temp_counter` must be adjusted to be between `n + 1` and `2 * n`, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `regulars[i]` must not equal `str(2 * n + 4)`, `moves` is updated to include 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + i + 1}', `i` is 3, and `len(regulars)` must be greater than 3; `target` is `2 * n + 4`.**
