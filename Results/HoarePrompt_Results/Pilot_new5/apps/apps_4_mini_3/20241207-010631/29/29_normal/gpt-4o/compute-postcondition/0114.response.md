Postcondition: ***`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`. `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`. `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`. `regulars[3]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes 'move {regulars[3]} {temp_counter}'. `i` is 3, `len(regulars)` is greater than 3, and `target` is `2 * n + 4`, provided that `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.***
