The code `print(line)` outputs the value of the variable `line`. The variable `line` is assigned the value from `script[1]`, which corresponds to the second entry in the `script` list. Since the initial conditions state that `script` contains at least `m + 1` entries, we know that `line` will be defined and has a specific value.

Therefore, the value of `line` is equal to `script[1]`, but since we do not have the explicit content of `script`, we can express it generically as `script[1]`.

The other variables mentioned in the initial state remain unaffected. Thus, the output state includes the information that `line` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `regular` contains at least `len(examples) + m` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + m + 1`, `script` contains at least `m + 1` entries formatted as `move {file} {i}`, `line` is equal to `script[1]` and has been printed.**
