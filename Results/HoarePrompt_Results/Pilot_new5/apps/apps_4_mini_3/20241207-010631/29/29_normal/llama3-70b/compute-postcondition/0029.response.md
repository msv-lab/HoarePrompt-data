To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how variables are modified throughout the execution based on the provided loop code and the initial conditions.

- The loop iterates over the `regular` list using `enumerate`, starting the index `i` from `len(examples) + 1`.
- During each iteration, a new string is appended to the `script` list, formatted as `move {file} {i}`, where `file` is the current element from `regular` and `i` is the current index.

Since `regular` must contain enough elements to allow the loop to complete, the number of elements in `regular` directly influences the number of iterations executed.

### Analyzing the Output State
1. If `regular` has `m` elements, the loop will iterate `m` times.
2. The value of `i` will range from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + m`.
3. After all iterations, the `script` list will contain `m` new entries with the format `move {file} {i}`.

### Final Output State
Given the information provided:

- `n` remains unchanged, still a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
- `files` remains unchanged and still contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1.
- `examples` remains unchanged, containing the first elements of the original tuples.
- `regular` must contain at least `len(examples) + m` elements, where `m` is the total number of iterations (i.e., the length of `regular`).
- The final `i` will be `len(examples) + m`.
- The `script` will contain `m` entries, all formatted as `move {file} {i}` for each corresponding `file` in `regular`.

Thus, the overall output state after the loop completes all iterations is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `regular` contains at least `len(examples) + m` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + m`, `script` contains `m` entries formatted as `move {file} {i}` for each corresponding `file` in `regular`.**
