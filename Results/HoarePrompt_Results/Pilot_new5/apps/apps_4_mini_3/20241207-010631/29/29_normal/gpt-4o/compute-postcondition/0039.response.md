To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to evaluate the conditions based on the current program state.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

1. The first part of the condition, `temp_counter <= 2 * n`, is dependent on the value of `temp_counter`. Since `temp_counter` is initialized to `2 * n + 2`, we have:
   - `temp_counter = 2 * n + 2`
   - Therefore, `temp_counter <= 2 * n` does not hold true, as `2 * n + 2` is always greater than `2 * n` for positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

2. The second part of the condition, `str(temp_counter) in files_set`, needs to be evaluated as well. For the loop to execute, the string representation of `temp_counter`, which is `str(2 * n + 2)`, must also be present in `files_set`. However, since `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `str(2 * n + 2)` would not be in `files_set`.

Given these observations, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust the value of `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. This can be accomplished by setting `temp_counter` to `2 * n`, which ensures that the first part of the condition will be satisfied.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` (which would then be `str(2 * n)`) is in `files_set`. Since `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `str(2 * n)` will be in the set.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state such that `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n` instead of `2 * n + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be set to `2 * n`**
