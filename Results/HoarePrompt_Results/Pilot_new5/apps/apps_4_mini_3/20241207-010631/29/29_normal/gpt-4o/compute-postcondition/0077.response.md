The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` must be at least `n + 1`, and currently `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n`, after incrementing it, `temp_counter` will be at least `n + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is now between `n + 2` and `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is now between `n + 2` and `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
