The code appends a formatted string to the list `moves`. The value of `temp_counter` remains unchanged, but its value is utilized in the formatted string. The variables `examples` and `i` are not defined in the initial state but are used in the code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `temp_counter`, `files_set`, and `n`, while indicating the addition to `moves`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`; `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `moves` has a new entry `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` appended to it.**
