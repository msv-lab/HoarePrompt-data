To determine what adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop. The loop will execute if the following conditions are met:

1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

From the provided state right before the loop:
- `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

Let's analyze the first condition:
- Since `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` translates to `n + 1 <= 2 * n`.
- This can be simplified to `1 <= n`, which is always true given `n` is a positive integer.

Now for the second condition:
- We need `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `str(n + 1)` exists in `files_set`.

Given that the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, it does not affect the checks for the `while` loop but indicates `examples` might not be contributing to the `files_set`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `str(n + 1)` is present in `files_set`. 

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `str(n + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a non-empty list of file names where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and `str(n + 1) must be in files_set`**
