The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n`, which implies that before the code executes, `temp_counter` is equal to `2 * n`. After executing `temp_counter += 1`, the new value of `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`**
