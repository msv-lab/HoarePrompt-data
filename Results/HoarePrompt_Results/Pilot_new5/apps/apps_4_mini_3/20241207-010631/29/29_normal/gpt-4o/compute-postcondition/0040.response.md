The value of `temp_counter` is initially set to `2 * n`. After the execution of `temp_counter += 1`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` starts as `2 * n`, the new value becomes `2 * n + 1`. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`**
