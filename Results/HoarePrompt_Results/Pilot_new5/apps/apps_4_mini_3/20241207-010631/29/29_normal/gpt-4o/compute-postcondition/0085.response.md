Postcondition: ***`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` includes the new operation 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + 1}', `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(2 * n + 1)` and `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`. If `regulars[i]` equals `str(target)`, then no changes are made to `regulars[i]` or `temp_counter`.***
