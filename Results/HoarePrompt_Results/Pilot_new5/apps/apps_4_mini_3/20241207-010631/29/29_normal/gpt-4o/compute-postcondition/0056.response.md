To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

The loop will continue executing as long as both conditions are true:

1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be present in the set `files_set`.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, it is possible that it is equal to `2 * n + 1`, which would mean it does not satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted to be at most `2 * n`. Additionally, we also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`, which is already a part of the current state.

Given that `temp_counter` is currently greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, the only adjustment we need to make is to ensure `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`**
