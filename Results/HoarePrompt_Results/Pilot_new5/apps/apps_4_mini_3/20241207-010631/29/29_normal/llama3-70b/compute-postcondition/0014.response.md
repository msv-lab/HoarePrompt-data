In the given code snippet, `regular` is assigned the list of first elements of tuples in `files` where the second element is `0`. The initial state tells us that `files` is sorted based on the second element of each tuple. Therefore, if any tuples exist in `files` with the second element equal to `0`, their first elements will be included in the `regular` list. The variable `examples` remains unchanged as it refers to the first elements of tuples where the second element is `1`, and `n` is also unchanged since it is not referenced or modified in the code.

Since we don't have specific values for `files`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `regular`. However, we can conclude that `regular` will contain the first elements of those tuples in `files` where the second element is `0`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples in `files` where the second element is 1; `regular` is a list of the first elements of tuples in `files` where the second element is 0.**
