The variable `file` is expected to be a string, which will be split into two parts: `name` and `type_`. The values of `name` and `type_` will depend on the specific content of `file`, but since `files` contains at least one tuple, `file` will be extracted from one of those tuples. The variable `files` remains unchanged. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list, `name` and `type_` are extracted from a string `file` that is split into two parts.**
