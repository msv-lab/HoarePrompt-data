To analyze the output state based on the loop provided, we can observe how the loop modifies the `temp_counter` variable and the conditions for its execution:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
   - `temp_counter` starts at `2 * n + 2`.
   - The loop continues to execute while `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is found in `files_set`.

2. **Output State after loop executes 1 time**: 
   - The loop executes once since `temp_counter` starts at `2 * n + 2`, which means `temp_counter` must be decremented to `2 * n + 1` before the loop can run. 
   - Thus, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1` after the first iteration. 
   - `n` is still a positive integer.

3. **Output State after loop executes 2 times**: 
   - For the loop to execute a second time, `temp_counter` must equal `2 * n + 1` initially and then increment by 1. Now `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 2`.
   - The loop must check if `str(temp_counter)` (which is now `str(2 * n + 2)`) is in `files_set` for the loop to run a second time.
   - Thus, the condition is satisfied, and `temp_counter` moves to `2 * n + 2`. 
   - `n` remains a positive integer.

4. **Output State after loop executes 3 times**: 
   - After the second time, `temp_counter` is equal to `2 * n + 2`. The loop checks if `temp_counter` can increment further. 
   - This means that for the third execution, `temp_counter` will now be `2 * n + 3`.
   - For the loop to execute a third time, `2 * n + 3` must also be in `files_set`. 
   - Thus, `temp_counter` increments by one again, now having a value of `2 * n + 3`.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the loop will continue executing as long as `temp_counter` is within bounds and the values are present in `files_set`.

**Final Output State**:
After all possible executions of the loop:
- `temp_counter` will have incremented to `2 * n + k` where `k` is the total number of times the loop executed (until the conditions are no longer met).
- If the loop executes `k` times, then the last value of `temp_counter` will be `2 * n + k`, where `k` is the maximum number such that `str(2 * n + k)` is in `files_set`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + k`, where `k` is the number of successful increments that satisfy the loop's conditions; `n` is a positive integer.**
