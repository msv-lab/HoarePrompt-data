To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions that must be satisfied based on the `while` loop statement.

The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **temp_counter**: It is currently `2 * n + 2`. For the loop to execute, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. However, since `2 * n + 2` is greater than `2 * n`, this condition is currently not satisfied. Therefore, `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. We can adjust `temp_counter` to `2 * n` (or any value less than `2 * n`).

2. **files_set**: It contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`. Since `temp_counter` will be adjusted to `2 * n` or less, we also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is indeed within the range of `files_set`. If we adjust `temp_counter` to `2 * n`, then `str(temp_counter)` will equal `str(2 * n)`, which is already in `files_set`. So no adjustment is needed for `files_set`.

In summary, the main adjustment needed is for `temp_counter`. It needs to be set to `2 * n` or any value less than that to satisfy the `temp_counter <= 2 * n` condition.

State: **`temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `regulars[i]` must not equal `str(2 * n + 4)`, `moves` is updated to include 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + i + 1}', `i` is 3, and `len(regulars)` must be greater than 3; `target` is `2 * n + 4`.**
