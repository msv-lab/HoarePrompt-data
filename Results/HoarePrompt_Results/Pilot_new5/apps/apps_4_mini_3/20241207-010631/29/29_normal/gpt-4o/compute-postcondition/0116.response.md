In the given code snippet, `moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')` constructs a string using the values of `regulars[i]` and `target`, and appends it to the `moves` list.

1. The precondition states that `i` is equal to `3`, which points to the fourth element in the `regulars` list (`regulars[3]`). 
2. `target` is defined as `2 * n + 4`.
3. We are appending a string to the `moves` list, which is formatted as `move {regulars[i]} {target}`.

Since `moves` is a list, its contents will be modified to include the new string. However, none of the other variables in the initial state are affected.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

- `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`.
- `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`.
- `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`.
- `regulars[3]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes an additional string formatted as `move {regulars[3]} {target}`.
- `i` is 3.
- `len(regulars)` is greater than 3.
- `target` is `2 * n + 4`.
- The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `regulars[3]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `moves` includes 'move {regulars[3]} {target}' appended, `i` is 3, `len(regulars)` is greater than 3, `target` is `2 * n + 4`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.**
