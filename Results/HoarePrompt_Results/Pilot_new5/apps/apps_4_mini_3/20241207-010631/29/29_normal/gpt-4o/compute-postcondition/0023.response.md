Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a non-empty list of file names where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to str(i + 1).***
