According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `files` list. The loop will iterate through each element in `files`. Since `files` is currently stated as a list (but the content is not specified), for the loop to execute, `files` must contain at least 1 file (i.e., at least one tuple). 

At the end of the last iteration, we could expect that if there were files, `examples` and `regulars` would potentially contain data derived from processing those files. However, since they are empty at the start, they will remain empty if the loop does not execute.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we must adjust the state of `files` to contain at least 1 tuple.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list**.
