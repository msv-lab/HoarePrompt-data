The variable `name` is extracted as the first part of the string from `file` after splitting, and `examples` is updated by appending `name` to it. The original values of `n`, `files`, `type_`, and `examples` remain unchanged except for the addition of `name` to `examples`. Since `examples` previously contained its own list of elements, the output state will reflect the updated state of `examples`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `name` is the first part of the string in `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string in `file` after splitting, `examples` now includes `name` appended to its previous contents.**
