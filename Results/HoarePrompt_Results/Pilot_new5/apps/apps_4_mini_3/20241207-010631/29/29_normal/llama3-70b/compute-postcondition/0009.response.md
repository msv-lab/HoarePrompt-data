The code snippet `name, type_ = input().split()` assigns values from the input to the variables `name` and `type_`. The `input()` function will take a string input, and `split()` will divide this string into components based on whitespace. The first component will be assigned to `name`, and the second component will be converted to an integer and assigned to `type_`.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and the `files` variable has one additional tuple, the input does not affect these variables. However, the `name` and `type_` variables will be updated based on the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and must be greater than 1 for another iteration; `files` contains one additional tuple `(name, int(type_))`, where `name` is a string from input and `type_` is an integer from the second part of the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and must be greater than 1 for another iteration; `files` contains one additional tuple `(name, int(type_))`, where `name` is a string from input and `type_` is an integer from the input.**
