According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. The loop can execute again if both conditions are true: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `n` as a positive integer, `temp_counter` equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. 

1. The condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` needs to be checked. Since `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, this means `temp_counter` is currently one unit greater than `2 * n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. This can be achieved by modifying `temp_counter` to equal `2 * n` or less.

2. The condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` must also hold true. Since `temp_counter` is currently set to `2 * n + 1`, it may need to be adjusted such that `str(temp_counter)` remains in `files_set`. However, since we only know `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n` or less, we cannot guarantee that `str(temp_counter)` for the new value will still be in `files_set`.

Thus, we can conclude that `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
