The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n`, we denote the previous value of `temp_counter` as `temp_counter` (which is currently `2 * n`) and after the execution of the code, it will become `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`**
