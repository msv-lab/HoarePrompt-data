The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, the validity of this condition will depend on its previous value. However, the specific previous value of `temp_counter` is unknown. Other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, and `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1**
