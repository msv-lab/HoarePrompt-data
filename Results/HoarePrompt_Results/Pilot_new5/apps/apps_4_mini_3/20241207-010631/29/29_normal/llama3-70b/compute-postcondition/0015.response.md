The code initializes an empty list called `script`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `script` is now an empty list while maintaining the original values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples in `files` where the second element is 1; `regular` is a list of the first elements of tuples in `files` where the second element is 0; `script` is an empty list.**
