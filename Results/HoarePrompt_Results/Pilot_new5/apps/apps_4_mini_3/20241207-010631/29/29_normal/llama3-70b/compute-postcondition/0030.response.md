The value of `script` is a list consisting of `m` entries formatted as `move {file} {i}` for each corresponding `file` in `regular`. Therefore, the length of `script` is equal to `m`. The other variables are not affected by the execution of the `print(len(script))` statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `regular` contains at least `len(examples) + m` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + m`, `script` contains `m` entries formatted as `move {file} {i}`, and the length of `script` is equal to `m`.**
