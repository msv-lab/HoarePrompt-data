The variable `script` is updated by appending a new string formatted as `move {file} {i}`. The value of `file` is the second element of `examples`, and `i` is currently `2`. Therefore, a new string `move {file} 2` is added to the `script` list. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `script` is a list containing the string `move {first element of examples} 1` and `move {file} 2`, `i` is 2, `file` is the second element of `examples`.**
