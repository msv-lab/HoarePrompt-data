To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop operates:

1. The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.
2. Current states are:
   - `temp_counter` is increased by 1 and must be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`.
   - `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`.
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
   - The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, where `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`.

For the loop to execute again:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `temp_counter` must also be in `files_set`, meaning that its string representation must fall within the range specified by `files_set`.

Analyzing the current state:
- `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` should not exceed `2 * n`.
- Since `files_set` includes strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `temp_counter` must additionally be strictly greater than `2 * n` in its string representation, which means it must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

Given that `temp_counter` is already increased by 1 and is supposed to be in `files_set`, this means that `temp_counter` must be adjusted to ensure it is still within the valid range of `files_set`.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, since it is currently less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`.

State: **`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`; `moves` is a list of all move operations performed; `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`; `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`; `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `regulars` is a non-empty iterable; `i` is 0; `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`; the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`**.
