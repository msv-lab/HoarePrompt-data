The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `temp_counter` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `temp_counter` has been increased by 1 without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files_set` must contain `str(n + 2)`, `temp_counter` is increased by 1**
