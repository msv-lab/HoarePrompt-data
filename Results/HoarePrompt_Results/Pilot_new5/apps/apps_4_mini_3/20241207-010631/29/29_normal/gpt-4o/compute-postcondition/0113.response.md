The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` was previously greater than `2 * n`, after the increment, `temp_counter` will remain greater than `2 * n`. The other variables remain unchanged in their definitions. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `regulars[3]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `moves` includes 'move {regulars[3]} {temp_counter}', `i` is 3, `len(regulars)` must be greater than 3, `target` is `2 * n + 4`.**
