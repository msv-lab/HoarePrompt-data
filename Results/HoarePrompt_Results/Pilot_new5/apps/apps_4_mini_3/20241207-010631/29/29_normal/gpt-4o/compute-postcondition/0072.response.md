According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. For the loop to execute, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and the string representation of `temp_counter` must be present in `files_set`.

Right before the loop, `temp_counter` is the next available number after the maximum processed index. Therefore, it is either greater than `2 * n` or not in `files_set`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, it needs to be adjusted such that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is included in `files_set`.

Since `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, we need to ensure both conditions are met. Specifically, `temp_counter` should be set to a value that falls within the range of `n + 1` to `2 * n`.

To summarize, for the loop to execute at least once, `temp_counter` should be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` should be one of the strings in `files_set`.

State: **`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` is a list of all move operations performed, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is 0, and `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`**
