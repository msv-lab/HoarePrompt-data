The variable `target` is assigned the value of `len(examples) + i + 1`. The length of `examples` is determined by the range of strings from `1` to `2 * n`, which means `len(examples)` is equal to `2 * n`. The value of `i` is `0`. Therefore, `target` will be calculated as `2 * n + 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` is a list of all move operations performed, `temp_counter` is the next available number after the maximum processed index, `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` must be a non-empty iterable, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`.**
