The variable `name` and `type_` are assigned values from the `input()` split into two parts. The initial state of the variables `n`, `files`, and `_` remains unaffected by this code. Therefore, the specific values for `name` and `type_` depend on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string**.
