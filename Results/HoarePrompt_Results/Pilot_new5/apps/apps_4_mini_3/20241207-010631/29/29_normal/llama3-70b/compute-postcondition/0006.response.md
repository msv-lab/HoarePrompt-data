The variables `name` and `type_` are assigned values from the input that is split into two parts. The initial state specifies that `name` is an input string and `type_` is also an input string. The variables `n`, `files`, and `_` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains one tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `_` is 1, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string.**
