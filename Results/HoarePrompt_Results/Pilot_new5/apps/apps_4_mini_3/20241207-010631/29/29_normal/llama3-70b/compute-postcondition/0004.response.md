The code `files.append((name, int(type_)))` adds a tuple containing `name` and the integer value of `type_` to the `files` list. The variable `n`, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000, remains unchanged. The list `files` will now contain one additional tuple. The values of `name` and `type_` are still considered as input strings, but `type_` will be converted to an integer for storage in the list.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains one tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `_` is 0, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains one tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `_` is 0, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string**.
