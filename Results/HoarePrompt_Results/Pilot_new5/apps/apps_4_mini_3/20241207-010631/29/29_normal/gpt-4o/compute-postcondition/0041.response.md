According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and the condition in the `files_set`. The loop can execute again if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1` 
- `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` (since `2 * n + 1 > 2 * n`).

This means that the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is currently false. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. 

We can achieve this by decreasing `temp_counter` by any amount greater than or equal to 2 (e.g., setting `temp_counter` to `2 * n`).

We also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` remains in `files_set` after the adjustment. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we can state that:
- `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be equal to `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be equal to `2 * n` and str(temp_counter) must be in files_set**.
