In the provided code snippet, `name` and `type_` are assigned values derived from splitting the string `file`. The `file` variable is expected to contain a string representing a file with its name and type separated by a space. Each element in the `files` list is a tuple, but the specific content of `file` is not provided. The variables `n` and `files` remain unaffected in terms of their types or constraints; however, `name` and `type_` will hold the respective parts of the string after splitting.

The output state reflects that `name` and `type_` have been assigned based on the split operation but does not specify their values since they depend on the content of `file`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples, `name` is the first part of the string in `file` after splitting, and `type_` is the second part of the string in `file` after splitting**.
