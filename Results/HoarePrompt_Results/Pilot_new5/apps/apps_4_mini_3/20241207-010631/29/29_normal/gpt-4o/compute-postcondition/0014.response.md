According to the code, the loop will execute for each tuple in the `files` list. For the loop to execute again, the `files` list must have more tuples to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, we know that the `files` list contains at least one tuple. 

Assuming the for loop has executed once, it would have processed the first tuple in the `files` list. Therefore, to execute again, the `files` list must contain at least 2 tuples. 

If `files` has more than one tuple, the next tuple to be processed will be the one following the one already processed. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `files` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples.**
