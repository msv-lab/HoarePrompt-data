The variable `script` is updated by appending a formatted string that includes the current value of `file` and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `len(examples) + 2`, it will directly represent the length of the `examples` list plus 2. The `file` variable is taken from `regular` corresponding to the current index, which is previously known. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `regular` must contain at least `len(examples) + 2` elements, `i` is equal to `len(examples) + 2`, `file` is the element from regular corresponding to the current index, and `script` now includes the string `f'move {file} {i}'` appended.**
