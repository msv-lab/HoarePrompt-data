The function accepts a positive integer `n` followed by `n` lines each containing a filename and a type (either "1" for example test or "0" for regular test). It processes the input, categorizing the filenames based on their types, sorts them by type in descending order, and generates a series of formatted strings to move the files, which it then prints, starting with the total count of these move commands. If there are no files of type "1", the function will still process and print the files of type "0", but the output will not contain any move commands for examples. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly to the standard output.
