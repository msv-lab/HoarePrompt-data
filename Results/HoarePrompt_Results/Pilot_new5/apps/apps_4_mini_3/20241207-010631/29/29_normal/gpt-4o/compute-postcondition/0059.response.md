The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`, it is ensured that `temp_counter` will not exceed this bound after the increment. The conditions regarding `n` being a positive integer and `str(temp_counter)` being in `files_set` remain valid. The previous value of `temp_counter` is not specified, but its new value will be based on the increment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to its previous value and less than 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.**
