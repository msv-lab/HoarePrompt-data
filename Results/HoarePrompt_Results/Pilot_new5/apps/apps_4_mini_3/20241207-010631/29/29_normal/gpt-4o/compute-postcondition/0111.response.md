The `moves` list is updated to include a new string formatted as `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}` where `i` is currently 3. The value of `regulars[i]` is a specific string since `i` is known, and `temp_counter` is a value that is already defined as being greater than `2 * n`.

Since `temp_counter` holds a specific value, the new entry in `moves` will be:

`moves.append(f'move {regulars[3]} {temp_counter}')`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as this code only modifies the `moves` list.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and not in `files_set`; `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`; `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`; `regulars[i]` must not equal `str(2 * n + 4)`; `moves` includes 'move {regulars[3]} {temp_counter}'; `i` is 3; `len(regulars)` must be greater than 3; `target` is `2 * n + 4`.**
