The line of code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a formatted string to the list `script`. The formatted string includes the current value of `file` and `i`. The variable `file` is derived from the `regular` list at the current index, which is `i - 1` since `i` is initialized to `len(examples) + 1`. 

Given that `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, it indicates that after the execution of this line, `i` will not change, but `script` will now contain an additional entry.

Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regular`, and `i`, along with the new state of `script`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `regular` must not be empty, `i` is len(examples) + 1, `file` is the element from regular corresponding to the current index, `script` now includes a new entry: 'move {file} {i}'**
