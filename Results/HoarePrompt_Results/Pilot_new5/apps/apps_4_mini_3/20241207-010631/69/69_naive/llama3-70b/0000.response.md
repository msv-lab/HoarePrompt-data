To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n`, a string `ops` containing operations, and two integers `x` and `y` representing the target coordinates.

2. **Determining Final Position**:
   - The program calculates the position `(ux, uy)` that the robot would reach after performing the operations in `ops`. This is done correctly by iterating over each operation and updating `ux` and `uy` based on the operation.

3. **Calculating Required Changes**:
   - The program calculates how far off the robot is from the target position with `dx = x - ux` and `dy = y - uy`.
   - A check is performed to determine if it is possible to reach the target coordinates. If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, the program prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to reach the target.

4. **Counting Changes**:
   - If it is possible to reach the target, the program then goes through the operations again to count how many changes are needed (i.e., how many operations do not contribute to moving towards the target).
   - The program counts the operations that need to be changed by checking if the current operation is not contributing to meeting the target.

**Edge Cases**:
- The program does not account for situations where the robot can move in the opposite direction. For example, if `dx` is positive (indicating more `R` moves are needed) but `dy` is negative, it does not adjust the operations accordingly, potentially leading to an incorrect output.
  
**Example of failure case**: 
- If `n = 3`, `ops = "URD"`, and the target is `x = 0, y = -1`, the robot does not have a way to reach the target because it needs to change `U` and `R` to `D`, but the logic would incorrectly count it as changeable.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
