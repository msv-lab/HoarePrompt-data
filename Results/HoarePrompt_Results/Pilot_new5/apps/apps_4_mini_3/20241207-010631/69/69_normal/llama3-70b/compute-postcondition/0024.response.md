The variable `ux` is decremented by 1. However, the initial value of `ux` is not provided, but since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), we can assume `ux` is also a non-negative integer that is at least 0. The specific impact on the output state is that `ux` is now one less than its previous value. The other variables, `n` and `operations`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 2, `ux` is decremented by 1.**
