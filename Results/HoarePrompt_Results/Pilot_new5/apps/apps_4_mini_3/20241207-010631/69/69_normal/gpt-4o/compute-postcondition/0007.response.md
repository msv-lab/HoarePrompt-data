`final_y` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `final_y` is 0, so the new value of `final_y` becomes -1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, and `op` is equal to 'D'.**
