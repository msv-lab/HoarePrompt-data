Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy) and `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i` where `i` is less than `n - 1`. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of `min_length` and `i - position_map[(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)]`. The values of `current_x` and `current_y` remain unchanged.***
