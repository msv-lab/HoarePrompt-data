The code assigns the value of `i` to `position_map[current_x, current_y]`. This directly updates the `position_map` at the coordinates `(current_x, current_y)` to the current value of `i`, which is less than `n - 1`. The values of `target_pos`, `min_length`, `current_x`, and `current_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy), `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `current_x` remains unchanged, `current_y` remains unchanged.**
