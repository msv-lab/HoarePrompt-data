The variable `ux` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and that `operations` is a string of length at least 2. However, there is no indication of the initial value of `ux`, so it is treated as an unknown value. The states of `n` and `operations` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 2, `ux` is increased by 1**.
