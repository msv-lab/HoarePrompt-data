The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. `n` is a positive integer that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', which represent moves. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers that can take values within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function processes these inputs to return a final position based on the movements specified by the `operations` string, starting from the initial coordinates (x, y). 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It returns the final coordinates after executing the moves specified in `operations` starting from the initial position (x, y).**
