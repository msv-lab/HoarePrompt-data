Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `ux` is the final value of `ux`, `uy` is the final value of `uy`, `lx` is the final value of `lx`, `ly` is the final value of `ly`, where `ux` represents the net horizontal movement (right is positive) and `uy` represents the net vertical movement (up is positive) based on the operations in the string, and `lx` and `ly` remain 0.**
