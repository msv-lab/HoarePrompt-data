Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1 and `res` may be increased by 1 based on the execution rules. Otherwise, if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is increased by 1, and `res` may be increased by 1 based on the execution rules. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1; if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is increased by 1; in both of these cases, `dy` is adjusted according to the next operation, and `res` may be increased by 1. For any other condition, `dx` and `dy` are both adjusted according to the next operation, `res` may be increased by 1, and additionally, `res` is increased by 1.***
