Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is 0. Otherwise, if `op` is 'R', `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` is 0. In both cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9 and -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9, and `op` is not equal to 'D'.***
