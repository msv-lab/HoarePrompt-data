The code operation `final_y -= 1` decrements the value of `final_y` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the current value of `final_y`. Assuming that `final_y` was defined or calculated based on `y` and potentially other operations during the iterations of the loop, it is clear that the operation only affects `final_y`.

Since `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged and the loop has completed, the output state will include the unchanged variables, and we will note that `final_y` has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9, `final_y` is decremented by 1.**
