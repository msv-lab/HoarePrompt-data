The variable `final_y` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, as they are not impacted by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `0`, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within the same range, `final_y` is incremented by 1.**
