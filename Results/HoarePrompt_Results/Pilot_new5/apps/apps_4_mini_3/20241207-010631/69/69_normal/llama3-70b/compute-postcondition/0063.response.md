The code snippet `dy -= 1` decreases the value of `dy` by 1. The initial conditions specify that `n` is a positive integer, and the other variables (`op`, `dx`, `dy`, `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res`) remain unchanged except for `dy`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dy` has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `op` is the next operation in ops, `dx` remains unchanged, `dy` is decremented by 1, and other variables `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
