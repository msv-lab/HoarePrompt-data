Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `operations` is a string of length `n` containing at least 1 character. If the first character `op` of `operations` is 'R', then `ux` is set to 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is set to -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0.***
