`x` and `y` are assigned the values from input which are both integers. The range of `x` and `y` is within -10^9 to 10^9, but the specific values are dependent on the input received. The other variables, `n` and `operations`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.**
