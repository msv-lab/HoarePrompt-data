Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1, while `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is updated to 0, while `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1, while `y`, `uy`, `ux`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `op` is not 'R' or if `dx` is less than or equal to 0, and if `op` is 'L' while `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`, while `dy` remains as `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 0. Otherwise, `dx` retains the value of `x - ux`, `dy` retains the value of `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, ensuring that either `op` is 'R' or `dx` is greater than or equal to 0.***
