The code snippet initializes the variables `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` to `0`. These variables have not been previously defined, so they are being set for the first time. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values for `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0**.
