Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), if either `dx` (which is `x - ux`) or `dy` (which is `y - uy`) is less than 0, then the value `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, `dy` is equal to max(0, y - uy), `dx` is equal to max(0, x - ux), and `res`, which is the count of invalid operations in `operations`, has been printed.***
