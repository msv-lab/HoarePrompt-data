The value of `ux` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `ux` was 0, so after the operation, `ux` becomes -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n` containing at least 1 character, `op` is the first character in `operations` which is 'L', `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ux` is -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n` containing at least 1 character, `op` is the first character in `operations` which is 'L', `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ux` is -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0.**
