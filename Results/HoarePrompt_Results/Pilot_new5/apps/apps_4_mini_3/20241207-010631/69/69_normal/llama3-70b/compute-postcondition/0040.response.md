Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `ux` is the final value of `ux`, `uy` is the final value of `uy`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, the current value of `dx` is `x - ux`, the current value of `dy` is `y - uy`, and either `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0.***
