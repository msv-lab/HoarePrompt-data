The variable `dy` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and that `op`, `dx`, and `dy` are updated according to some rules, but only `dy` is directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state updates `dy` while retaining the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `op` is the next operation in ops, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is updated by adding 1, and `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
