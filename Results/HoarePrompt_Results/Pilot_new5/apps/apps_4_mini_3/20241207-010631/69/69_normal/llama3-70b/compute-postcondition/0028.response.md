Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 2, and `op` is the second character of `operations`. If `op` is 'U', then `uy` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', then `uy` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decreased by 1.***
