Output State: **`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations; `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations; `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`; `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`; `min_length` is updated to the minimum of the current `min_length` and `i - position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}; `n` is greater than 0; `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + (x - final_x), current_y + (y - final_y)`; the current value of `target_pos` is in `position_map`.**
