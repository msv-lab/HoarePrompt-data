    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), if either `dx` (which is `x - ux`) or `dy` (which is `y - uy`) is less than 0, then the value `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, `dy` is equal to max(0, y - uy), `dx` is equal to max(0, x - ux), and `res`, which is the count of invalid operations in `operations`, has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It computes the net movement based on the operations and checks if the final coordinates can be reached from the initial coordinates (x, y). If the required movement in either the x or y direction is negative, it prints -1. Otherwise, it counts and prints the number of operations that could not be executed to reach the target coordinates.
