The value of `current_x` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `target_pos` was updated to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `position_map[current_x, current_y]` was updated to `i`, under the condition that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy); `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`; `i` must be less than n - 1; `current_x` is incremented by 1.**
