Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is updated to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the difference between `i` and the value stored in `position_map[target_pos]`. There is no change to `min_length` if `target_pos` is not found in `position_map`.***
