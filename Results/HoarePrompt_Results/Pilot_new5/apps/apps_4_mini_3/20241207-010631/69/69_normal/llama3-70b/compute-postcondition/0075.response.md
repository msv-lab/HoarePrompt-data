The value of `dx` is decremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `dy`, and `res` remain unaffected. The previous value of `dx` is not specified, but it is adjusted downwards by 1. The output state will reflect the change to `dx` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `dx` is adjusted down by 1, `dy` is adjusted according to the next operation, `res` may be increased by 1 based on the execution rules.**
