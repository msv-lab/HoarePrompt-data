The value of `current_y` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations, `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations, `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + (x - final_x), current_y + (y - final_y)`, `position_map` is updated to include (current_x, current_y) with value `i`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `current_y` is incremented by 1.
