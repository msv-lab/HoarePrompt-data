Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the net horizontal and vertical displacements based on 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' operations. If `operations[i]` is 'U', then `current_y` is incremented by 1, and `target_pos` is updated to `current_x + (x - final_x), current_y + (y - final_y)`, while `position_map` is updated to include `(current_x, current_y)` with value `i`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is decremented by 1, `target_pos` is updated to `current_x + (x - final_x), current_y - 1 + (y - final_y)`, and `position_map` is updated to include `(current_x, current_y)` with value `i`, while `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is decremented by 1, `target_pos` remains as `current_x + (x - final_x), current_y + (y - final_y)`, with `position_map` updated to include `(current_x, current_y)` with value `i`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1, `target_pos` is updated to `current_x + 1 + (x - final_x), current_y + (y - final_y)`, `position_map` includes the updated position `(current_x + 1, current_y)` with value `i`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1.***
