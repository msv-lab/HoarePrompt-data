The variable `a8` is assigned the value of `(y ** z) ** x`. Given the initial state where `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers, this calculation will result in `a8` being equal to `y` raised to the power of `z`, and that result raised to the power of `x`. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, `a5`, and `a6` remain unchanged, while `a7` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `(y ** z)`; `a8` is equal to `(y ** z) ** x`.**
