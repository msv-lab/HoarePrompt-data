The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are replaced by the values of `map(float, input().split())`, which means they will now hold the real numbers inputted by the user. The previous constraints still apply: they must be positive real numbers within the range of 0.1 to 200.0, with exactly one digit after the decimal point. Therefore, the output state reflects the update in values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on user input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user, satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0, with exactly one digit after the decimal point.**
