The variable `a4` is assigned the value of `(x ** z) ** y`, which simplifies to `x ** (z * y)` based on the properties of exponents. The value of `x`, `y`, and `z` are all positive real numbers inputted by the user, satisfying the conditions given (0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0). The states of the other variables (`a1`, `a2`, and `a3`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `(x`, `a4` is equal to `x ** (z * y)`**.
