Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` (between 0.1 and 200.0, inclusive) from user input and calculates twelve different exponentiation combinations of these numbers. It then determines which combination yields the maximum value and prints the corresponding expression as a string (like 'x^y^z'). The function does not handle invalid input or cases where the input is outside the specified range. **
