The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y` (i.e., `a2 = x ** (z ** y)`). The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged and are still within the specified range of 0.1 to 200.0. The only updated variable is `a2`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user, satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x ** (z ** y)`**
