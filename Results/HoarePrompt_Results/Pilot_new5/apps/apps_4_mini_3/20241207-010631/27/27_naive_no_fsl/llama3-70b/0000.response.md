Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle situations where multiple expressions yield the same maximum value. According to the problem description, if there are multiple maximums, the program should print the one that comes first in the list of expressions. However, the current implementation uses `a.index(max(a))` to find the index of the maximum value in the list, which will return the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value. This is not an issue on the surface, but it can fail in cases where the expressions that yield the maximum value are not in the proper order or are equal.

For example, consider the input:
```
2.0 2.0 2.0
```
In this case, both `x^y^z`, `y^x^z`, and `z^y^x` yield the same maximum value since they all equal `2^(2^2) = 16`. The program outputs `x^y^z` correctly here, but if the expressions produced the same maximum value in a different order, it could lead to incorrect behavior. 

Another edge case is if we have:
```
1.5 1.5 1.5
```
This would yield:
- `1.5^1.5^1.5` for `a1`
- `1.5^1.5^1.5` for `a5`
- `1.5^1.5^1.5` for `a9`

In this scenario, all three expressions would yield the same maximum value, but if `a1` comes before `a5`, the output would be `x^y^z` instead of `y^x^z` or `z^y^x`, which could potentially cause confusion since they yield the same max value. 

Thus, the program fails to ensure that it accurately identifies the first occurrence correctly in all cases, as it relies solely on the order of elements in the lists without explicitly checking for ties. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
