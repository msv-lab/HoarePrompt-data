Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Let's analyze a specific case where the program fails:

1. **Input x = -90**: In this case, the correct expected output should be 1 because rotating -90 degrees counter-clockwise would require one 90-degree clockwise turn to correct the orientation. However, with the current implementation:
   - The program calculates `x % 360`, which gives -90.
   - When it checks the condition `if x == 0`, it fails.
   - The next operation calculates `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which evaluates to `(-90 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` = `-1 // 90 % 4` = 0.

Thus, the program outputs `0`, which is incorrect. 

The discrepancy in handling negative angles demonstrates that the logic is not accurately reflecting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct for all inputs.
