Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Normalization of Angles**: The program uses the line `normalized_angle = x % 360` to normalize the camera angle. This is correct in principle but does not address the counter-clockwise rotation correctly when calculating the necessary 90-degree clockwise turns.

2. **Calculation of Turns**: The calculation `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` is flawed. This formula attempts to calculate the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation. However, it does not account for the fact that when the angle is negative (indicating counter-clockwise rotation), simply subtracting `normalized_angle` from 360 and dividing by 90 can lead to incorrect outputs.

3. **Counter-clockwise rotations**: The program fails to properly handle scenarios where the original angle is negative. For example, if the input is `-60`, the normalized angle would be `300`. The program calculates the turns as `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4`, which results in 0 turns, whereas the problem description states that 3 turns are needed to achieve minimal deviation.

4. **Output**: The output should reflect the minimum number of turns required to achieve the minimal deviation from vertical, but the logic used does not correctly capture that scenario in all cases.

To summarize, the program does not correctly handle both positive and negative angles and does not compute the minimum number of clockwise turns accurately for all possible input values. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem as stated, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
