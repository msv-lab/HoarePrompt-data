The `print(turns)` statement outputs the value of `turns`. The variable `turns` is calculated based on the `normalized_angle`, which in turn depends on the value of `x`. The initial state provides a range for `x`, and consequently, `normalized_angle` and `turns` will be determined based on that input.

Since `turns` is calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, and `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`, the specific values of these variables will depend directly on the value of `x`.

The output state does not change the values of `x` or `normalized_angle`, but it does define what `turns` will be when printed.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360` in the range [0, 359]; `turns` is calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, and the value of `turns` has been printed.**
