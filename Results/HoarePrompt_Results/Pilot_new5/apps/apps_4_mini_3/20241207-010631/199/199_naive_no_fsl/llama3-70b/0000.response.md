To verify the correctness of the provided program, we must determine if it correctly counts the number of distinct ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the length of the stick.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` initializes a count `ways` to zero.
   - It uses two nested loops: the outer loop iterates through potential lengths `a` for one pair of sides of the rectangle, and the inner loop iterates through potential lengths `b` for the other pair, ensuring `b` is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - The condition `if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` checks:
     - Whether `a` and `b` are distinct (to avoid forming a square).
     - Whether the total length of the stick (which is `2 * (a + b)`) matches `n`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the count of `ways`.

### Validation of the Cases

1. The program checks for pairs `(a, b)` such that:
   - They are distinct.
   - Their combined length forms half of `n` (since each length appears twice in a rectangle).

2. **Identifying Edge Cases**:
   - Consider `n = 1`. The only parts would be `{1, 1, 1, 1}`, which is a square. The program should return `0`.
   - For `n = 2`, the only parts would be `{1, 1, 1, 1}`, which is still a square. The program should return `0`.
   - For `n = 3`, we have `{1, 1, 1, 1}` which again is a square. The program should return `0`.
   - For `n = 4`, we can only have `{1, 1, 1, 1}` which is a square. The program should return `0`.
   - For `n = 5`, only `{1, 1, 1, 1}` is possible, which is a square. The program should return `0`.
   - For `n = 6`, the only valid combination is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which can form a rectangle. The program should return `1`.
   - For `n = 8`, the combinations would lead to pairs that form squares as well (e.g., `{2, 2, 2, 2}`). Should return `0`.
   - For `n = 10`, the combinations also lead to squares. Should return `0`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - If we test `n = 7`, the only pairs are invalid as they do not satisfy the rectangle condition.
   - If we test any even `n` greater than `6`, the combinations should yield valid rectangles with non-square outputs.

### Conclusion

However, the program does not check for all cases correctly. For example, for `n = 8`, it does not handle the scenario properly where it should yield only rectangles. 

Given that the program can yield wrong outputs for some cases, such as `n` values that do not properly produce distinct rectangles, the correctness conclusion is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program doesn't account for all potential `n` values correctly, leading to incorrect counts of rectangles in some scenarios.
