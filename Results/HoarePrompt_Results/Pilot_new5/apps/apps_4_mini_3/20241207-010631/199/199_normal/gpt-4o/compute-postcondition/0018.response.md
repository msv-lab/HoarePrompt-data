According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `n // 4`. The loop will continue as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 4`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 1, `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * a`, and if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, `count` is updated to 2. The values of `a` and `b` are set to `previous_value_of_a + 1`.

Given that `a` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be one unit greater than `previous_value_of_a`, and it must not exceed `n // 4`. Therefore, `a` will become `previous_value_of_a + 1 + 1` (which is `previous_value_of_a + 2`), and `count` remains as is unless the conditions for updating `count` are met.

So, if `n // 4` is greater than `previous_value_of_a + 1`, the states must reflect these updates.

State: **`count` is 1, `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * (previous_value_of_a + 2)`, `a` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`, `b` remains as `previous_value_of_b`.**
