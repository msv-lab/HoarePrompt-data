The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 1, so the new value of `count` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is now 2, `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * previous_value_of_a - 8`, `a` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`, `b` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * previous_value_of_a - 8`, `a` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`, `b` is `previous_value_of_a + 2**
