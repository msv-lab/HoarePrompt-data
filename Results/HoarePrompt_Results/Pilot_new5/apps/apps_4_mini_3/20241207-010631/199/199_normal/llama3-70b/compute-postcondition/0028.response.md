The variable `ways` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that `2 * (3 + b) == n` for valid `b`. Since `a` is 3 and `b` is also initially 3, it holds that `a` and `b` are not equal (this is consistent since `b` will eventually be a different valid value for the equation). 

Since `n` must be greater than 7 and holds that `2 * (a + b) == n`, the valid pairs condition still applies after the increment of `ways`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 7, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that `2 * (3 + b) == n` for valid `b` and `ways` has been increased by 1, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, and `a` is not equal to `b`.**
