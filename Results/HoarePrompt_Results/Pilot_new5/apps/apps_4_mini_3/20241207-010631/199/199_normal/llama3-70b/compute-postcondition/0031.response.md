The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `ways` represents the number of valid pairs `(3, b)` such that `2 * (3 + b) == n`, we can infer that `ways` was previously a count of those pairs. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 14, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that `2 * (3 + b) == n` plus 1, `a` is 3, `b` is 4.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 14, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that `2 * (3 + b) == n` plus 1, `a` is 3, `b` is 4.**
