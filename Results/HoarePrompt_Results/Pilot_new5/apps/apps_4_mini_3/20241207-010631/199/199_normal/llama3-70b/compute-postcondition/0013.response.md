According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates with `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`. If `n` is at least 2, then `n // 2` is at least 1, which allows for at least one iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `a` is currently 1 or more, depending on how many iterations have taken place. The loop will execute one more time as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.

If `a` is currently 1, then for the loop to execute again, `a` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4 (so that `n // 2` is at least 2).

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (1, b) found where `b` varies from 1 to (n - 1) // 2, `a` is 2**
