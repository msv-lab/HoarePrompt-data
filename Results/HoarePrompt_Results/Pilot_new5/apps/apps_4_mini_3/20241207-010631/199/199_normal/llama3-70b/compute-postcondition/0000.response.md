The variable `ways` is initialized to 0. Since there are no other dependent variables affected by this code, the state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `ways` while maintaining the condition for `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, `ways` is 0**
