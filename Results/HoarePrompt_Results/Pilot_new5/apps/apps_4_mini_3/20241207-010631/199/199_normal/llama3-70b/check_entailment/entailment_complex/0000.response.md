The program is not correct according to the problem description. 

**Explanation of Incorrectness:**

1. **Understanding of Rectangles vs Squares**: The problem states that Pasha wants to split a stick into four parts such that he can form a rectangle but cannot form a square. For a rectangle, we need two pairs of equal lengths (like {1, 1, 2, 2}), and for a square, all four lengths must be the same (like {2, 2, 2, 2}). The program, however, only checks for pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` without properly ensuring that these parts can form a rectangle while avoiding a square. 

2. **Pairs Logic**: The program counts pairs `(a, b)` such that `a` and `b` are distinct and satisfies the equation, but it does not consider the condition of forming a rectangle versus a square explicitly. It counts combinations that may include configurations that can be squares (like when `a` might equal `b`), which is contrary to the specification that it must avoid configurations that can form a square.

3. **Valid Range of Parts**: When checking for pairs of parts, the program does not consider that the total length `n` must allow for at least two distinct lengths for parts, which is crucial to ensure that a square cannot be formed. The checks it performs can miss valid configurations that satisfy the rectangle condition but fail the square condition.

4. **Missing Cases and Edge Handling**: The program fails to handle certain edge cases where the total length could potentially yield valid rectangles but not squares when properly configured. 

Due to these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement to count valid configurations.

**Correctness**: **False**
