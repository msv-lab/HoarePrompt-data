To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem description:** The task is to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. The lengths of the parts are positive integers.
2. They can form a rectangle, but not a square.

For four parts to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of equal lengths. Thus, they should take the form `{a, a, b, b}` where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the sides. 
To ensure they do not form a square, we must have `a` not equal to `b`.

**Program Analysis:**
The provided code is as follows:
```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways
```

- The outer loop iterates `a` from `1` to `n // 2`.
- The inner loop iterates `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
- The condition checks if `a != b` and if `2 * (a + b) == n`, which ensures that the total length matches `n` and satisfies the rectangle condition.

**Edge Case Considerations:**
1. If `n < 4`, itâ€™s impossible to form four parts of positive lengths, and thus the function should return 0.
2. If `n` is even, we need to ensure that there are valid values for `a` and `b`.
3. If `n` is odd, `2 * (a + b)` can never equal `n`, and hence the function should return 0.

**Output Hints Analysis:** 
The output hints indicate that the function counts distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) == n`, with the constraints mentioned above. The hints also state that the function checks for distinctness by ensuring `a != b`.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not handle cases where `n < 4`, returning 0 in those cases, which is correct. However, there is no explicit check for such values. For example, if `n = 3`, the function will run the loop and fail to find valid pairs, but it does not handle this specifically.
- The logic for distinguishing between rectangles and squares seems to be working based on the checks for `a` and `b`.

However, the program may potentially miss edge cases due to not explicitly checking for `n < 4` before executing the loops. Thus, we can conclude that while the function might return the correct answer in practice for some valid `n`, it does not strictly adhere to the problem description for all inputs, particularly not handling inputs less than 4 effectively.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not explicitly check for values of `n < 4,` which means it could give misleading outputs for such cases.
