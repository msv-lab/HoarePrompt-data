The value of `b` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`, while `b` remains as `previous_value_of_b` prior to this assignment. Therefore, the new value of `b` will now be equal to `previous_value_of_a + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`count` is 1, `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * (previous_value_of_a + 2)`, `a` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`, `b` is equal to `previous_value_of_a + 2`.**
