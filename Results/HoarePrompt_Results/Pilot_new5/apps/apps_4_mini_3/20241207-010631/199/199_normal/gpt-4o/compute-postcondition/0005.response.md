The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`, which is 1. The values of `count` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is 1, `b` is 1**.
