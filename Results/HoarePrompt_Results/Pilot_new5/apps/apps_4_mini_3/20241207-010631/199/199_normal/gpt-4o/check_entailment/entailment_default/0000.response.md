To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code logic and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap:
Pasha wants to perform exactly three cuts on a wooden stick of length `n`, creating four parts of positive integer length. The goal is to count the distinct ways to split the stick such that:
1. The lengths can form a rectangle.
2. It is impossible to form a square.

### Code Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count
```
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if `n` is less than 6, returning 0 if true. This is correct because we cannot form four positive integer parts from a stick of length less than 6.
2. **Loop**: It iterates `a` from 1 to `n // 4`. This is appropriate because for rectangles formed by pairs of lengths, `a` must be less than or equal to `n // 4`.
3. **Calculation**: It sets `b = a`, which is correct for forming rectangles (two sides of equal length). Then it calculates `rem`, the remaining length of the stick.
4. **Conditions**: 
   - It checks if `rem` is positive and even. This is necessary because the remaining length must be split into two equal sides (the other two sides of the rectangle).
   - The condition `if a != rem // 2:` ensures that we don't form a square (which requires all four parts to be equal).

### Output Hints Analysis:
The hints describe what the function does and confirm that it:
- Returns 0 for `n < 6`.
- Counts valid pairs `(a, b)` for rectangles where `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program correctly avoids cases where `n < 6` and logically handles the rectangle formation. However, there is a potential issue regarding the maximum valid value for `a`. Specifically, if `n` is just above a multiple of 8 (e.g., `n = 9`), the function will run its loop up to `2`, where valid pairs are not possible, but it might count incorrectly for higher values of `n`.

### Checking Against Provided Examples:
- For `n = 6`: The program correctly identifies one way to split (1, 1, 2, 2).
- For `n = 20`: The program identifies four distinct ways to split (1, 1, 9, 9), (2, 2, 8, 8), (3, 3, 7, 7), and (4, 4, 6, 6), which matches the output hint.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle all edge cases correctly and has a critical flaw in its logic when `n` is just above a multiple of 8 as it doesn't check for valid configurations comprehensively.

Correctness: **False**.

**Reason**: The program does not correctly calculate all valid configurations for values of `n` that are just above certain thresholds, potentially missing valid combinations, especially when analyzing higher ranges of `n`.
