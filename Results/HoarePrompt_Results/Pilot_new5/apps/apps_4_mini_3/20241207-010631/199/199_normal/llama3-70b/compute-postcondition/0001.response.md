According to the code, the loop will execute if the range specified in the for loop is valid. The range is defined as `range(1, n // 2 + 1)`. 

1. The starting point of the range is 1, which is valid.
2. The ending point of the range is `n // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the expression `n // 2` must be at least 1. This means that `n` must be at least 2 (since if `n` is 1, `n // 2` equals 0 and the loop will not execute).

Given that `n` is already stated to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9), we can conclude:
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute.
- We need to set `a` to 1 at the start of the loop because `a` will start at the first value in the range.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
