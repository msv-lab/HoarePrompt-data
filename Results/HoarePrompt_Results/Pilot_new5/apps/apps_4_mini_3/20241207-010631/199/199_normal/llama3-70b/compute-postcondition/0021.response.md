According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop runs for `b` starting from `a` and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`. If the condition allows for another iteration, `b` must be incremented by 1 from its last value in the previous iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. Given that `n` is at least 4, and based on the logic involving `a` and `b`, we need to check the next value of `b`. If the last value of `b` was `k`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must become `k + 1`, and the upper limit of the loop must also accommodate this increment.

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time:
- The new value of `b` should be `k + 1`.
- For this to happen, `n - a` must still be at least `2 * (k + 1)`.

Thus, if `k` is the last value of `b`, we update the state as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `ways` is the number of valid pairs found plus 1 if `a` is not equal to `k + 1` and `2 * (a + k + 1)` equals `n`; `b` is `k + 1`.**
