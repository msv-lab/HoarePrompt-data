According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `a` and `n`. The loop iterates over the variable `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, and `n` is greater than 14. The current value of `b` is 4, and for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must increase by 1. Therefore, the new value of `b` will be 5.

Next, we need to ensure that this new value of `b` does not exceed the limit defined by `(n - a) // 2`. To execute the loop again, `n` must be such that `(n - a) // 2` is at least 5.

Given that `n` is greater than 14, we can set the condition for `n` as follows:

- Since `a` is 3, we need:
  \[
  (n - 3) // 2 \geq 5 
  \]
  \[
  n - 3 \geq 10 
  \]
  \[
  n \geq 13 
  \]
  
Since `n` is already greater than 14, the condition for `n` is satisfied.

Thus, the modified state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`n` is greater than 14, `a` is 3, `b` is 5**
