`ways` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ways` is unknown, but it is updated to its current value plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `a` is still 1, `b` is at least 2, and `ways` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is still 1, `b` is at least 2, and `ways` is incremented by 1.**
