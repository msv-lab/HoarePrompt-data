#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user to input a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), and prints the value of `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. However, it does not return any value or indicate what the output represents. It is important to note that the function relies on user input and does not handle any input validation or edge cases beyond the assumption that the input will always be a valid positive integer within the specified range.
