The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no change made to any variables or state, we simply acknowledge that the code execution moves to the next loop iteration.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
