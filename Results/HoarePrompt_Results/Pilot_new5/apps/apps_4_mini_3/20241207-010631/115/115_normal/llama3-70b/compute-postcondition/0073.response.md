The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `A`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of rows, and `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, with constraints that both integers are within the range of 2 to 50. The parameter `A` is a 2D list of integers consisting of elements that can either be 0 or 1, with dimensions `n x m`. 

The function processes these inputs but does not provide specific return conditions in the output description. Therefore, the exact return value of the function is not defined in the output provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer), m (an integer), and A (a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m).**
