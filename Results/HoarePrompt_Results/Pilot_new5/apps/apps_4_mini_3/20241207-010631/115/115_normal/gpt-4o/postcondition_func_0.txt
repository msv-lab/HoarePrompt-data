The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, along with a 2D list `A` of dimensions `n x m` filled with integers (0 or 1). It identifies all 2x2 blocks of ones in `A` and records their top-left coordinates in a list called `operations`. If all elements in `A` match the corresponding elements in a newly created 2D list `B` (which is populated based on the identified blocks of ones), it prints the number of found operations and their coordinates. If there are discrepancies between `A` and `B`, the function returns -1. The function does not return any result other than -1 when discrepancies are found, nor does it have specified behavior for the case when no blocks are found.
