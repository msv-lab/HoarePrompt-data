Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, while it correctly identifies and records the positions of all possible 2x2 blocks of 1s in the matrix `A` and attempts to construct matrix `B` accordingly, it does not handle the following critical scenarios:

1. **Incomplete Coverage of 1s**: The program assumes that if it finds a 2x2 block at a certain position, it can simply set those corresponding values in `B` to 1, but it does not account for the possibility that not all 1s in `A` can be covered by 2x2 blocks. For example, if `A` contains isolated 1s or 1s arranged in a way that does not allow complete coverage by 2x2 blocks, the program will still proceed to check for discrepancies without addressing this situation upfront.

2. **Output of -1**: The problem description specifies that if it is impossible to transform `B` to match `A`, the program should output -1. The current implementation attempts to check all entries of `A` against `B` but will return -1 only if it finds discrepancies after processing possible 2x2 blocks. This means there could be scenarios where parts of `A` cannot be covered by 2x2 blocks, but the program fails to identify that before the final comparison.

Thus, there are cases where the transformation might be impossible (i.e., matrices do not match) but the algorithm would still incorrectly return a valid sequence of operations. For example, if `A` has 1s in positions that cannot be reached by any 2x2 operations (like a single 1 surrounded by 0s), the program would not recognize this as impossible until the final check, leading to incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement all requirements of the problem description.
