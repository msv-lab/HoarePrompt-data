Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`. `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is `m - 1`. If at least one of the elements in the 2x2 submatrix defined by `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1 for any `j`, then `ops` contains tuples for each `(i + 1, j + 1)` where the condition is satisfied; otherwise, `ops` remains unchanged.**
