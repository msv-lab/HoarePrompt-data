According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which iterates over the range of `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `m` is between 2 and 50, after incrementing, `j` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be 1.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` is a list of coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A` or empty, `j` is 1, and the value of `A[i][j]` is equal to the value of `B[i][j]**.
