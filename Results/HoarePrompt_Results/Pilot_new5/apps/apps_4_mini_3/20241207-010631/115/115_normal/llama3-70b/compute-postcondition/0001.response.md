The 2D list `A` is assigned values from the input, where each sub-list is formed by mapping the input strings to integers across `n` rows. The dimensions `n` and `m` are already defined to be between 2 and 50, and since `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, this means that the entries in `A` will be populated based on the user's input.

Since `A` is explicitly defined to take input from the user, the values of this list will depend on what is inputted. However, the state of `n` and `m` is unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the updated output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m` populated by user input.**
