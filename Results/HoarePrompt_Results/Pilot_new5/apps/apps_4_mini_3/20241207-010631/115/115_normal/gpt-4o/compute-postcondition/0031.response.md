Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where elements are set to 1 for each position that is part of a detected 2x2 block of 1s in `A`, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, and `j` will be equal to `m - 2` after the last iteration.**
