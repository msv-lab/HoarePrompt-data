`ops` is a list that will have a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `0`, the new tuple will be `(n, 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged, and `ops` is updated with the new tuple. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, and `ops` now contains the tuple `(n, 1)`**.
