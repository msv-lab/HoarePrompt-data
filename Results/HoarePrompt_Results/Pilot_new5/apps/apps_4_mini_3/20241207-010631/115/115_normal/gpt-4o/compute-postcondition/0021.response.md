The `operations` list is updated to include the new coordinates `(i + 1, j + 1)`, where `i` is a variable representing a row index in the 2D array `A`, and `j` is initialized to `0`. Thus, the element being appended to `operations` will be `(i + 1, 0 + 1)` which simplifies to `(i + 1, 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `operations` contains the previous coordinates plus the new coordinate (i + 1, 1), `B` is updated such that `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `j` is 0.**
