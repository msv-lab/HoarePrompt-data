The variable `operations` has the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the resulting tuple will be `(1, 2)`. Therefore, `operations` will now contain the value `[(1, 1), (1, 2)]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `operations` contains the value [(1, 1), (1, 2)], `B` has updated values with `B[0][1] = 1`, `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
