The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the current context, where `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, this means that the tuple `(1 + 1, 0 + 1)` will be `(2, 1)`, which will be added to `ops`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` now includes the tuple (2, 1).**
