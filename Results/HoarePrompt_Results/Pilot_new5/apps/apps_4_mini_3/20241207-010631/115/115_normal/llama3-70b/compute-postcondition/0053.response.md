Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`. If at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` has a new entry `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, no actions are executed.***
