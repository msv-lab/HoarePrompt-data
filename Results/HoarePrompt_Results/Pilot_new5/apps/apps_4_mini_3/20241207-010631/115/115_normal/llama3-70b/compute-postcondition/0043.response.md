Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0. The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.***
