The values of `n` and `m` are assigned from input, where the input consists of two integers separated by space. Given that `n` and `m` must remain within the range of 2 to 50, the output state will reflect that they are now specific integers based on input. However, since the exact input values are not provided, we cannot specify the new values of `n` and `m`. 

The dimensions of the 2D list `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the state of `A` is still a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 with dimensions `n` x `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers assigned from input within the range 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50.**
