According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `ops`. The `for` loop will iterate over `ops`, so it requires `ops` to have at least one tuple for the loop to execute. The variables `n` and `m` indicate the dimensions of the 2D list `A`, but they do not directly affect the execution of the loop unless they are relevant to the contents of `ops`.

To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments are necessary:
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
- The loop variable `op` would be the first tuple in `ops` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` must have at least 1 tuple, `op` is the first tuple in `ops`**
