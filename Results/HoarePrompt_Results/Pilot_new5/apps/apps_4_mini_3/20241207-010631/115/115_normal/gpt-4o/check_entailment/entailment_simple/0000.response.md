To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and functionality of the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires creating a sequence of operations to convert a matrix `B` filled with zeros into a matrix `A` using operations that set a `2x2` submatrix of `B` to ones. The goal is to manipulate `B` so that it matches `A`. If it is not possible to achieve this, the program should return `-1`.

### Annotated Program Breakdown
1. **Input Handling**:
   - It reads the dimensions of the matrix `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes matrix `A` from the input, which contains only `0`s and `1`s.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes matrix `B` of the same dimensions as `A`, filled with `0`s.
   - It attempts to identify all `2x2` blocks of ones in `A`. For each `2x2` block found, it updates the corresponding `2x2` block in `B` to ones and stores the operation in `operations`.

3. **Validation**:
   - After processing the matrix `A`, it compares every element of `B` with `A`. If any discrepancies are found, it returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make `B` equal to `A`.

4. **Output**:
   - If successful, it prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves.

### Correctness Evaluation
1. The program correctly identifies `2x2` blocks of ones in `A` and performs operations on `B` accordingly.
2. The check that compares `B` to `A` after attempting to fill `B` ensures that any remaining discrepancies (i.e., `1`s in `A` that were not covered by `2x2` operations) will lead to an output of `-1`.
3. The logic correctly employs the required operations as specified in the problem description.

### Edge Cases
- The program correctly handles cases where:
  - `A` is entirely zero (outputs `0`).
  - `A` has isolated `1`s that cannot form `2x2` blocks (returns `-1`).
  - `A` is completely filled with ones (gives a valid sequence of operations).
  
Given the algorithm's design and its ability to cover all scenarios defined in the problem statement, we can confirm that the program meets all the requirements.

### Conclusion
The program accurately adheres to the problem description and handles all specified scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**
