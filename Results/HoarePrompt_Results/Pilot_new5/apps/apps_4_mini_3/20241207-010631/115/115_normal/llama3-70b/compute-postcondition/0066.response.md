The code prints the first element and second element of the tuple `op`, which is the first tuple from the list `ops`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged. The output will be the specific values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`, which are derived from the first tuple in `ops`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`; `ops` must have at least 1 tuple; `op` is the first tuple in `ops`; the output is `op[0]` and `op[1]`.**
