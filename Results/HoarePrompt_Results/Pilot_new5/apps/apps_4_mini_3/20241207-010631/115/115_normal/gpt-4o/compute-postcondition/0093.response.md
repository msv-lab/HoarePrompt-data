The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of rows, and `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, with the constraints that both `n` and `m` are between 2 and 50. The parameter `A` is a 2D list of integers (of dimensions n x m) where each element is either 0 or 1. 

After executing the function body, the function may return -1 in multiple cases, specifically when there is a discrepancy between the values of `A` and a supposed reference (not defined in the output but implied as `B`) at various coordinates or conditions. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers, and return -1 under various conditions indicating discrepancies between the values in `A` and an expected comparison set of values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (integers) and A (a 2D list of integers) and returns -1 to indicate discrepancies in values based on specified conditions.**
