Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `A[0][1]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[0][2]`, and `A[1][2]` are all 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the program does not change state.***
