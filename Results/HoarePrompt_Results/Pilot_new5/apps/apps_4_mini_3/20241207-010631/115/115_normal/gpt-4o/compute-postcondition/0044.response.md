The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. The values of `i` and `j` are given as `n - 1` and `2`, respectively. Therefore, `i + 1` will be `n` and `j + 1` will be `3`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and the `operations` list is updated.

Output State: **`A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1; `B[n - 1][2]` is set to 1; `B[n][2]` is set to 1; `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, and now includes (n, 3); `i` is n - 1; `j` is 2; `m` must be greater than 3**.
