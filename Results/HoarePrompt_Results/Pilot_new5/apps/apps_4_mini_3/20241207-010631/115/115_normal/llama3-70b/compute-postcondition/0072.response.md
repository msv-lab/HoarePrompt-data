Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, then `ops` contains tuples representing the positions of adjacent cells checked where at least one cell is equal to 1 during the iterations of the loop. If the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500, then `ops` is a list of tuples with dimensions equal to the number of tuples in `ops`, each tuple representing positions of adjacent cells, and all tuples in `ops` have been printed.***
