The code appends a tuple containing `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are not specified, but they must be integers such that `j + 1` remains a valid index. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, and `j` is the next index (j + 1); `ops` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended.**
