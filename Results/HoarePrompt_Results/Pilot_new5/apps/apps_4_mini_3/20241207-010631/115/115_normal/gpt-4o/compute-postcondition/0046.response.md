Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element in `B` corresponding to the top-left corner of each detected 2x2 block of 1s in `A` is set to 1, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is `m - 2` if at least one 2x2 block of 1s is found; if no blocks are found, then `B` remains unchanged and `operations` is empty.**
