The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `1`, the values will be calculated as follows:

- `i + 1` equals `n`
- `j + 1` equals `2`

Thus, the tuple `(n, 2)` will be added to the list `operations`.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is updated such that `B[n - 1][2]` is 1 and `B[n][2]` is 1, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1, and `(n, 2)` is appended to `operations`.**
