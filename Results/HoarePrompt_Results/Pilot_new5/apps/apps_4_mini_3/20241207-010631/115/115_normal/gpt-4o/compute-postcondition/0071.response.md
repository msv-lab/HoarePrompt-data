To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the provided loop code and the initial state.

The loop runs for `j` in the range of `m`, checking each element in row `i` of the 2D lists `A` and `B` to see if they are equal. If at any point they are not equal, the function will return -1, but if they are equal for all iterations, the loop completes without returning a value.

Since `i` is set to 1, the loop will iterate through each column of row 1 of both 2D lists. These iterations will only succeed if all corresponding elements in row 1 of `A` and `B` are equal.

After all iterations of the loop finish, we can conclude that:
- Since `j` runs from 0 to `m-1`, it will have taken on all integer values in that range.
- If the loop completes without returning -1, then all values `A[1][j]` must be equal to `B[1][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, and the value of `A[1][j]` is equal to the value of `B[1][j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.**
