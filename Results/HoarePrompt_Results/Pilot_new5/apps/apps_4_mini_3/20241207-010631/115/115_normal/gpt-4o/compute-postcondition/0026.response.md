Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`. If `A[i][j]` and `A[i][j + 1]` are both 1, and both `A[i + 1][j]` and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are also 1, then `operations` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, 2)`, `j` is 1, and `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `B[i + 1][1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][2] = 1`.***
