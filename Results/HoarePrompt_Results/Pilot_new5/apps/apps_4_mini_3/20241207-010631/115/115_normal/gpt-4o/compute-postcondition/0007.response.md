Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `operations` contains the value [(1, 1)], and `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, where `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`; `i` is 0; `j` is 0, if the condition of the if statement is met. If the condition is not met, then the values of `operations`, `B`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
