According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, and `m` is an integer between 2 and 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is currently `0`, after the increment, `j` will become `1`. For the loop to continue executing, `m` must be greater than `1`, which it is, because `m` is at least `2`. 

Thus, the required states after the next iteration will be:
- `j` is `1` (as it will be incremented)
- The condition `m must be greater than 1` remains valid because `m` can still be between 2 and 50.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, and `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1 if `A[n - 1][0]`, `A[n - 1][1]`, `A[n][0]`, and `A[n][1]` are all equal to 1.**
