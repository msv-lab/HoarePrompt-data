To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables and the for loop itself.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(m - 1):`. The loop will execute as long as `m - 1` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2, which is already guaranteed by the problem statement (since `m` is between 2 and 50).

2. The variable `j` is initialized to `m - 2`, which means it starts at a certain value based on `m`. In the first iteration of the loop, `j` will take on the value of 0 (since `range(m - 1)` will generate values from 0 to `m - 2`).

3. The loop will iterate `m - 1` times, and `j` will take on values from 0 to `m - 2`. Given that the initial state has `j` set to `m - 2`, this means the loop is valid and will execute at least once.

4. The state of `i` is set to 1, which does not directly affect the loop's execution but may be relevant depending on what the loop body does.

In summary, the states should be adjusted as follows:

- `n` and `m` are within the defined range (2 to 50).
- `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`.
- `ops` contains tuples representing positions (i + 1, j + 1) related to the cells checked.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` should begin at `m - 2` (but will be adjusted to 0 for the loop).

Thus, the adjusted states before the loop should be:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is 0**.
