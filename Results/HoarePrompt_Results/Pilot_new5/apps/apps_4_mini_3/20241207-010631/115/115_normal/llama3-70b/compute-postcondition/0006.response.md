The code `continue` indicates that the program should skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since it is not specified which loop we are in, we can only conclude that the current iteration is being skipped without modifying any variables or their values.

Therefore, the output state will simply reflect that the current iteration has been skipped and the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0; the current value of `A[0][0]` is 1, `A[1][0]` is 1, `A[0][1]` is 1, and `A[1][1]` is 1; the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
