The operation `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple to the `operations` list. The values being appended are `i + 1` and `j + 1`. The variable `j` has a specific value of 2. 

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value, but we know that `i + 1` will at least be 1 (if `i` is at least 0). The value of `j + 1` will be 3, as `j` is 2. Therefore, the tuple will be `(i + 1, 3)`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `j` is 2, `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `B[i][3] = 1`, `B[i + 1][1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][2] = 1`, `B[i + 1][3] = 1`, `operations` has a new tuple `(i + 1, 3)` appended to it.**
