Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`; `ops` is a list of tuples with dimensions equal to the number of tuples in `ops`; `op` will have been assigned to each tuple in `ops` during the loop execution; all tuples in `ops` have been printed.**
