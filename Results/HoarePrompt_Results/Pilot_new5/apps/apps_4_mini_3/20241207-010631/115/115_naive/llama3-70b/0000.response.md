To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the matrices `n` and `m`, and then reads matrix `A` from the input.

2. **Operations List**: The program initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations that will transform matrix `B` into matrix `A`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program uses nested loops to iterate through each possible `2x2` submatrix in `A` (indexed by `i` and `j`).
   - It checks if the current `2x2` submatrix can be made entirely `1`s by checking if all four corners are `1`s using the condition:
     ```python
     if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
     ```
   - If this condition is not met, it checks if at least one of the four elements is `1`:
     ```python
     if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
     ```
     If this condition is true, it appends the operation `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the length of `ops` exceeds `2500`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves.

### Issues:
- The key issue arises in how the program determines whether it can create the desired `1`s in matrix `B`. 
- The current logic does not guarantee that all `1`s in matrix `A` are covered. Specifically, it can miss situations where there are `1`s that are not part of any `2x2` block. For example, if `A` has a configuration like:
    ```
    1 0
    1 1
    ```
  The program will not perform the necessary operation to cover the `1`s correctly.
  
- Moreover, if `A` consists mostly of `1`s but has some `0`s in positions that lead to invalid `2x2` regions, the program will incorrectly assume it can still produce the required `1`s without checking for the existence of `0`s in positions that must be `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all possible configurations correctly, particularly those where `1`s are isolated or cannot form a valid `2x2` block. Therefore, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **False**. 

For example, the input:
```
2 2
1 1
0 0
```
would yield an output of operations, but it is impossible to make `B` equal to `A` since there's a `0` in `A` that can't be covered by a `2x2` operation.
