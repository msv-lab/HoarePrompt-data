Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw in its logic that may result in incorrect outputs for certain cases. Specifically, the program attempts to generate matrix `B` to match matrix `A` by only considering `2x2` submatrices where all four cells must be `1` in matrix `A`. However, this approach can fail when `A` has isolated `1`s or when `1`s are not in `2x2` configurations.

For example:

Input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

Expected output:
```
-1
```

However, the program will not produce `-1` in this case. It will miss out on the `1`s in positions `(1,1)`, `(1,3)`, and `(3,1)`, which cannot be achieved using the defined operations because there is no `2x2` submatrix that encompasses them.

Thus, the program fails to account for configurations in `A` that cannot be formed into `B` using the specified operations, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
