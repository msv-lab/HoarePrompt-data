Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if matrix B can be made equal to matrix A. Specifically, there are cases where the program fails to validate that all necessary operations are performed. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 0
1 0 0
```

In this case, matrix A looks like this:

```
1 1 1
1 1 0
1 0 0
```

To achieve this matrix A, the only possible operations would be on the following 2x2 submatrices:

1. The submatrix starting at (1,1) - which can set B to:
```
1 1
1 1
```
2. The submatrix starting at (2,1) - which can only partially fill the required elements of A.

However, after the operations, resulting B will not match A because the last columns of the last row cannot be set to 1 through the available operations.

The program does not take into account that after applying operations, matrix A could have a configuration that is impossible to replicate in B, resulting in the output being `-1`, but the program may not reach that conclusion correctly.

Thus, the code is incorrect as it fails to handle such cases, leading to potential errors in its output.
