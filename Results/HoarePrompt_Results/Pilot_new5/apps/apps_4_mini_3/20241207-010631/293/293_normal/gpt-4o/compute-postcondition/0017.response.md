The variable `current_node` is updated using the expression `2 * current_node + 2`. The value of `current_node` was previously either 1 or 2 based on the second character in `path`. 

If `current_node` was 1:
- The new value of `current_node` would be `2 * 1 + 2 = 4`.

If `current_node` was 2:
- The new value of `current_node` would be `2 * 2 + 2 = 6`.

Therefore, the output state must reflect both possible scenarios for `current_node`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 3; `path` is a binary string of length `h` that must have at least 2 characters; `current_level` is 0; `direction` is the second character in `path`; `current_node` is either 4 or 6.**
