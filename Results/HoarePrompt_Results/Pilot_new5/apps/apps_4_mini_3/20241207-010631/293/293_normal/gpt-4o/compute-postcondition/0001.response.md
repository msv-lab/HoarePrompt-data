The values of `h` and `n` are both assigned new integers based on the input read from standard input. The constraints specify that `h` must fall within the range of 1 to 50, and `n` must be within the range of 1 to \(2^h\). Therefore, after the execution of the code, the output state retains the validity of these constraints but updates the values of `h` and `n` to the integers input by the user. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, where `h` and `n` are assigned values from the input.**
