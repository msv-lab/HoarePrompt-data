To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem statement and the code.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Amr follows an infinite command string "LRLRLRLR..." to navigate a perfect binary tree of height `h`.
2. It is required to count the number of nodes visited before reaching a specific exit located at leaf node `n`.
3. The rules for movement are:
   - 'L' goes left, 'R' goes right.
   - If Amr revisits a node, the command is skipped.
   - If two consecutive commands are skipped, he returns to the parent node before executing the next command.
   - Upon reaching a leaf that is not the exit, he returns to the parent node.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        
        n //= 2
        
    print(ans)
```

### Steps of the Program:
1. The program first reads values for `h` and `n`.
2. It initializes `ans` to count the nodes visited.
3. It enters a loop that continues while `n` (the index of the exit node) is greater than 1:
   - If `n` is even, it adds `(n // 2) - 1` to `ans`.
   - If `n` is odd, it adds `n // 2` to `ans`.
   - Then, it updates `n` to its parent node by performing `n //= 2`.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:
- The algorithm does not simulate the movement through the tree according to the "LRLR..." string. Instead, it computes the number of nodes visited based on the index of the exit node `n` in the binary tree.
- While the calculations performed in the loop might yield a result, they do not account for the specific movement rules (skipping nodes, returning to parent if two commands are skipped, etc.) described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The essential flaw in the provided program is that it does not follow the logic of Amr's movement through the binary tree as dictated by the command sequence. It does not simulate the traversal according to the problem requirements and thus will not give the correct count of nodes visited before reaching the exit.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Correctness: **False**
