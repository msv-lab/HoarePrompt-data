The variable `total_leaves` is assigned the value of \( 2^h \). Given that `h` is an integer satisfying \( 1 \leq h \leq 50 \), this means `total_leaves` will be \( 2^h \), which is a value between \( 2^1 = 2 \) and \( 2^{50} = 1125899906842624 \). The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the previous conditions on `h` and `n` still hold.

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`.**
