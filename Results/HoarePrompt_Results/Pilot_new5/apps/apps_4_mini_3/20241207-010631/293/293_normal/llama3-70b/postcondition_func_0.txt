The function accepts two integers, `h` and `n`, where `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. It calculates a value `ans` based on the iterations of halving `n` until it becomes 1. During each iteration, if `n` is even, it adds `(n // 2 - 1)` to `ans`; if `n` is odd, it adds `(n // 2)` to `ans`. Finally, it prints the accumulated value `ans`. The function does not return any value.
