The value of `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` must be greater than 1 and is an odd integer, the result of `n // 2` will yield an integer value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1 and an odd integer, `ans` is equal to the previous value of `ans` plus `n // 2`.**
