Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `h` and `n` from input, where `h` is between 1 and 50, and `n` is between 1 and \(2^h\). It calculates the number of nodes visited in a binary tree traversal based on the binary representation of `n - 1`, which is padded to a length of `h`. It then prints the total count of visited nodes, which will always equal `h` after the traversal. **
