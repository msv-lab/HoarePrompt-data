According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2 and has been updated to `n // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 after this update.

Given that `n` was greater than 2 before the update, it is necessary to ensure that the new value of `n` after the update (i.e., `n // 2`) is also greater than 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 before being divided by 2, which means `n` must currently be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is greater than or equal to 4**
