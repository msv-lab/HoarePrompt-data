The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 0; `path` is a binary string of length `h`; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 0.

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 0; `path` is a binary string of length `h`; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 0.**
