`ans` is incremented by the value of `n // 2 - 1`. Since `n` is an even integer and greater than 1, `n // 2` is a positive integer. Thus, `ans` will now be equal to the original value of `ans` plus this calculated value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1 and an even integer, `ans` is now equal to the original `ans` plus `n // 2 - 1.**
