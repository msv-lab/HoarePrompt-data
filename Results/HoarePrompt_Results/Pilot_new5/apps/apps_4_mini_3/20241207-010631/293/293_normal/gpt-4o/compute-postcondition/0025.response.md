Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is equal to `h`; `path` is a binary string of length `h`; `current_level` is `h - 1`; `current_node` is determined by traversing the binary tree according to the `path`, and the value `visited_count` has been printed.**
