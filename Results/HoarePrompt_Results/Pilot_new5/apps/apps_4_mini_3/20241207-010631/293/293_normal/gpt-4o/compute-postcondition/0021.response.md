The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `2 * current_node + 1`. The value of `current_node` depends on the value of `direction`. If `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is either 3 or 5; for the other case, if `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is either 4 or 6. Therefore, we can calculate the new value of `current_node` based on the two cases:

1. If `direction` is '0':
   - `current_node` can be either 3 or 5.
   - For `current_node = 3`: New value = `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.
   - For `current_node = 5`: New value = `2 * 5 + 1 = 11`.

2. If `direction` is not '0':
   - `current_node` can be either 4 or 6.
   - For `current_node = 4`: New value = `2 * 4 + 1 = 9`.
   - For `current_node = 6`: New value = `2 * 6 + 1 = 13`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 5; `path` is a binary string of length `h` that must have at least 4 characters; `current_level` is 1; `direction` is the fourth character in `path`; if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is either 7 or 11; otherwise, if `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is either 9 or 13.**
