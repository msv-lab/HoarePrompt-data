The code `ans += n // 2 - 1` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `n // 2 - 1` to it. The value of `n` is given to be greater than or equal to 4, which means `n // 2` will be at least 2. Thus, `n // 2 - 1` will be at least 1, ensuring that `ans` is incremented by at least 1. However, the exact new value of `ans` cannot be determined without its initial value.

The other variables (`h` and `n`) remain unchanged, and `h` still satisfies the condition of being an input integer between 1 and 50, while `n` remains greater than or equal to 4.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is greater than or equal to 4; `ans` is increased by `n // 2 - 1`.**
