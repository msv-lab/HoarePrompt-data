The value of `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged as they are unaffected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, `ans` is 0**.
