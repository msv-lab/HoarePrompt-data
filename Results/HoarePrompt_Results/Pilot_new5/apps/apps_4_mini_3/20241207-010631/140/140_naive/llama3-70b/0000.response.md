The provided program attempts to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, it only checks if the graph is acyclic without considering the option of removing an edge to break cycles.

The main issues with the program are:

1. It does not account for the situation where one edge can be removed to make the graph acyclic. If there is a cycle, the program immediately prints "NO" without evaluating the possibility of removing an edge to break the cycle.

2. There is no logic present to check if it is feasible to break the cycle by removing just one edge. The program should implement additional logic to explore all edges in the graph and determine if removing any of them results in an acyclic graph.

For example, consider the following scenario:
- Input:
```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
In this case, there is a cycle (1 → 2 → 3 → 1), and removing any one of the edges can result in an acyclic graph. The expected output should be "YES", but the provided program would output "NO".

Given these issues, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements completely.

Correctness: **False**.
