The function accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph with integer keys (vertices) and lists of integers (edges). It calculates whether there are cycles in the graph by checking if all vertices can be processed based on their incoming edges. The function returns True if there are cycles in the graph (i.e., some vertices cannot be processed), and False if there are no cycles present. This implementation assumes that the graph contains vertices numbered from 1 to n, where n is an integer between 2 and 500.
