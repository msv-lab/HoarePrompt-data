Postcondition: ***`node` is the current vertex, `graph[node]` has at least one unvisited neighbor remaining, and if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True indicating that the current vertex 'node' has an unvisited neighbor in the recursion stack. Otherwise, there is no explicit action taken.***
