According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[u]`. If `graph[u]` has more elements, the loop can execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is 2, and `v` is the second element in `graph[u]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be updated to the next element in `graph[u]`, and `u` remains unchanged.

So, if `graph[u]` has at least 3 elements, after the current iteration, `v` should be the third element in `graph[u]`, and `in_degree[v]` will remain incremented by 1.

State: **`in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, `u` is 2, `v` is the third element in `graph[2]`**
