n is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (u, v) representing directed edges, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, and each ordered pair (u, v) appears at most once in the list.
