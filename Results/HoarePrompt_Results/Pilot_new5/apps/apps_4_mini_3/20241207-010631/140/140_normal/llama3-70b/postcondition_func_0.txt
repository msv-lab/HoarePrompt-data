The function accepts an integer `node`, a list of lists `graph` representing directed edges, and two lists of booleans `visited` and `rec_stack` to track the visitation status of vertices and the recursion stack, respectively. It performs a depth-first search to detect cycles in the directed graph. The function returns True if a cycle is detected (if a neighbor is found that is already in the recursion stack), and returns False if no cycle is present from the current vertex `node`. The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are out of expected bounds, such as an invalid `node` index or when lists are not of the correct size.
