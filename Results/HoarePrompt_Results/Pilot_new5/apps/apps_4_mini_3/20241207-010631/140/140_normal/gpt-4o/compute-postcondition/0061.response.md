Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented for all neighbors of `node`, `queue` contains all nodes with `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is the total number of vertices processed, `node` is the last value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, and all neighbors of `node` have their `in_degree` updated accordingly.**
