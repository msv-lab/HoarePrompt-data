The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`in_degree[neighbor]`, `queue`, `node`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented for all neighbors of `node`, `queue` contains all nodes with `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is increased by 1, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented for all neighbors of `node`, `queue` contains all nodes with `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is increased by 1, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`**.
