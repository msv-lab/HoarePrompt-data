The code assigns `True` to `rec_stack[node]`, indicating that the current `node` is now part of the current recursion stack. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current vertex; `graph` is a list of lists representing the directed edges of the graph; `visited[node]` is True; `visited` contains booleans indicating whether each vertex has been visited; `rec_stack[node]` is True; `rec_stack` is a list of booleans indicating whether each vertex is in the current recursion stack; the number of vertices `n` is between 2 and 500; and the number of edges `m` is between 1 and min(n(n - 1), 100000).**
