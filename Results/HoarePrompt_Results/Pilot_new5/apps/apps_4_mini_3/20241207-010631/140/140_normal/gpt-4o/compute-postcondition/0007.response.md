The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, where `v` is the third element in the iterable of `graph[1]`. Given that `graph[u]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `v` will be the third element of that iterable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, `u` is 1, `graph[u]` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, and `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1 for the third element `v` in `graph[1]**
