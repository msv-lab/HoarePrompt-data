According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the neighbors of the current node in the graph. If `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, the loop will iterate over each neighbor. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `node` is the current vertex and `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor. 

If the loop has executed for one of the neighbors, it implies that there are still neighbors left to iterate over. Thus, to execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we will be iterating over the next neighbor in the list of neighbors for `node`.

If the loop has just finished processing one neighbor, we can infer that the next neighbor is available for processing in the upcoming iteration. Therefore, we must ensure that the states reflect the next neighbor in the list as well as confirm that the list of neighbors still has one or more neighbors remaining.

Assuming that the index of the neighbors is incremented after each iteration, we can conclude that in the next iteration, we will be processing the next neighbor.

State: **`node` is the current vertex, `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor remaining, and `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in the list**
