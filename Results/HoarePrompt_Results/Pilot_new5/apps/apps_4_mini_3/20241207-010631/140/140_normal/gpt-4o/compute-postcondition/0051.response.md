`neighbor` is appended to `queue`, which means that `queue` will now contain an additional element, `neighbor`. The other variables remain unchanged, but the state of `queue` will reflect this addition.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, `queue` now contains all nodes with `in_degree[node] == 0` and `neighbor`, `count` is now 2, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 1 neighbor, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.**
