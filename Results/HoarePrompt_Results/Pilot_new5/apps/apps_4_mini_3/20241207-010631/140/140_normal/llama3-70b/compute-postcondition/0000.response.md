The code `visited[node] = True` marks the current vertex `node` as visited in the `visited` list. The `node` variable represents a specific vertex in the graph, and its specific value is not provided, but it will range from 1 to `n`. The `visited` list is updated to reflect that this specific vertex has now been visited.

Since `visited[node]` is set to `True`, the state of the `visited` list will change at the index corresponding to the value of `node`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of lists representing the directed edges of the graph, `visited[node]` is True, `visited` contains booleans indicating whether each vertex has been visited, `rec_stack` is a list of booleans indicating whether each vertex is in the current recursion stack, and the number of vertices `n` is between 2 and 500, and the number of edges `m` is between 1 and min(n(n - 1), 100000).**
