`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state indicates that there is at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` will be updated to reflect that one of its incoming edges has been removed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` has at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, `queue` contains the previous nodes plus `neighbor`, `count` remains 1, `node` is the same as the previous value, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`; `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1.**
