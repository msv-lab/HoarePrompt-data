The code snippet initializes `queue` as a deque (double-ended queue) containing all nodes (vertices) from `in_degree` whose value is 0. This means that all vertices with no incoming edges will be added to the `queue`.

Given the initial state where `in_degree[v]` holds the number of incoming edges to each vertex `v` in `graph`, the values in `in_degree` will determine which vertices are added to `queue`. Specifically, vertices for which `in_degree[v]` equals 0 will be included.

Thus, the output reflects the state of `queue` after executing the code, based on the values in `in_degree`.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the number of incoming edges to each vertex `v` in `graph`; `queue` contains all nodes for which `in_degree[node] == 0`.**
