The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (from 1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, constrained to be between 2 and 500. The output of the function indicates whether there is a cycle in the directed graph: if the count of processed nodes is not equal to `n`, the function returns `True`, indicating that there are nodes in the graph that are part of a cycle; otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the graph has no cycles. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter graph, which is a dictionary representing a directed graph, and returns True if there are cycles in the graph; otherwise, it returns False indicating no cycles are present.**
