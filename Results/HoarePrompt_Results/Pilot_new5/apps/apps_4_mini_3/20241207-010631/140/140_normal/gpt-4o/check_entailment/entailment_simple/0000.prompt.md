You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) contains integers representing directed edges such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing `m` valid edges, and `graph` is a defaultdict where each key is a vertex `u` and each value is a list containing all vertices `v` that `u` points to from the edges list.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES' indicating that the current state of the graph does not have any cycles.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing `m` valid edges, and `graph` is a defaultdict where each key is a vertex `u` and each value is a list containing all vertices `v` that `u` points to from the edges list. The graph represented by `edges` contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list containing all valid edges, `graph` is a defaultdict containing all vertices and their corresponding adjacency lists after all edges have been checked, and all edges in `edges` have been processed with respect to cycles.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that there is likely a condition in the graph or edges that does not permit a certain operation or that a cycle has been detected.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (from 1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices; n is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500).
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree[v]` is equal to the number of incoming edges to each vertex `v` in `graph`, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n`, and all values are integers representing the number of directed edges for each vertex; `u` is each vertex from 1 to `n`.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `count` is equal to the total number of vertices in the graph that have been processed (i.e., those with their `in_degree` reduced to 0), `in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` that were reachable from the initial vertices with `in_degree[v] == 0` is now 0, while those that were not reachable retain their original `in_degree` values. If `count` is equal to the number of vertices in the graph, then the graph has no cycles; otherwise, there are nodes in the graph that are part of a cycle.
    return count != n
    #The program returns True if count is not equal to n, indicating there are nodes in the graph that are part of a cycle; otherwise, it returns False, indicating the graph has no cycles.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
