Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1 for all neighbors of `node`, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` includes `neighbor` as well as at least one other neighbor of `node`, while `count` remains the same and `node` is the next value obtained from `queue.popleft()`.***
