The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of vertices), an integer `m` (the number of directed edges), and a list of `edges` representing directed edges in a graph. It checks if the directed graph contains cycles. If the graph is acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If a cycle is detected upon removing any edge from the graph, it also returns 'YES', indicating that the graph remains acyclic without that edge. If no such condition is met, it returns 'NO', indicating the presence of a cycle or a failure to meet the conditions set by the edges. The function does not handle cases where the input values for `n` and `m` are outside the specified constraints.
