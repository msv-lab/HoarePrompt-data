Postcondition: ***`node` is the current vertex and `graph[node]` has at least one neighbor remaining. If `neighbor` has not been visited, and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, it indicates that there is at least one unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, confirming that there is at least one unvisited neighbor remaining for the current vertex in the graph.***
