The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. Since `in_degree[v]` must have at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, it indicates that `neighbor` is a vertex that previously had an incoming degree. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree[v]` must have at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, `queue` now contains at least one additional node (neighbor), `count` remains 1, `node` is the same as the previous value, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` must have at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, `queue` now contains at least one additional node (neighbor), `count` remains 1, `node` is the same as the previous value, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1.**
