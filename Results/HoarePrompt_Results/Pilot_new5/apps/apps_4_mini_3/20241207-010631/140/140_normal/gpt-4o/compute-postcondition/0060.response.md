Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1; if `in_degree[neighbor]` becomes 0, `queue` includes `neighbor`, `count` remains 3, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, and `graph[node]` still contains at least 2 neighbors. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` now includes `neighbor`.***
