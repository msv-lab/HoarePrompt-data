According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, the `queue` contains all nodes for which `in_degree[node] == 0`. For the loop to execute the first time, `queue` must contain at least one node. 

Therefore, `in_degree[v]` must be such that at least one vertex `v` has `in_degree[v] == 0`. Thus, we need to ensure that there is at least one node with zero incoming edges.

State: **`in_degree[v]` must have at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, `queue` contains all nodes for which `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is 0**
