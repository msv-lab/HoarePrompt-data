The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. However, the values of the variables remain unchanged because there is no assignment or modification taking place. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables but acknowledges the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or a key in `d` for which `d[a1]` equals `n // 2`, and `a2` is either -1 or a key in `d` for which `d[a2]` equals `n // 2`. At least one of `a1` or `a2` is -1; 'NO' has been printed.**
