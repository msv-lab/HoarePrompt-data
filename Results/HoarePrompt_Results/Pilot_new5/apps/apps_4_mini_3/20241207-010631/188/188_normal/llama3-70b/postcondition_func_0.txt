The function accepts an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and then reads `n` integers (each between 1 and 100) from user input. It counts the occurrences of each integer and checks if there are exactly two distinct integers that appear `n / 2` times. If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
