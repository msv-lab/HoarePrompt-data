Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, and `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`. If `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, then if `c` is equal to 0, `a1` is set to the value of `i` and `c` is increased by 1; otherwise, `a2` is set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
