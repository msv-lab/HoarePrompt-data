`a` is modified by appending a new integer which is the result of `int(input())`. The initial state indicates that `a` contains some input integer(s), and now it will contain one additional integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, and `a` contains the previous integers plus one additional integer obtained from input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` contains the previous integers plus one additional integer from input.**
