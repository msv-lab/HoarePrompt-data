Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If both `a1` and `a2` are valid keys in `d` for which `d[a1]` equals `n // 2`, then 'YES' has been printed along with the values of `a1` and `a2`. Otherwise, at least one of `a1` or `a2` is -1, and 'NO' has been printed.***
