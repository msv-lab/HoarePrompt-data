The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the values of `a1` and `a2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but since the print operation shows the current values of `a1` and `a2`, they will be reflected in the output.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is the first key in `d` for which `d[a1]` equals `n // 2`, `a2` is the second key in `d` for which `d[a2]` equals `n // 2`, both `a1` and `a2` are not -1, 'YES' has been printed, and `a1` and `a2` have been printed.`**
