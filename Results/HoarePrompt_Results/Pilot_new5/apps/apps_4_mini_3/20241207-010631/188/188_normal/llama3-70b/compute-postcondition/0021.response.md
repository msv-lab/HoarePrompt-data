The statement `d[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list or array `d` by 1. The variable `i` is defined as the next element from the list `a` following the current element, which means it represents an index in `d`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `d` remains unchanged except for the specific index `i` being modified.

Since `d` is being updated but no other variables are affected by this code, the output state will reflect the change made to `d[i]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next element from the list `a` following the current element, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
