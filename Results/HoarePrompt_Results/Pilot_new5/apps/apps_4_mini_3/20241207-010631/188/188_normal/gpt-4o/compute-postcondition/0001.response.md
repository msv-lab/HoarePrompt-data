The variable `cards` is assigned a list of `n` integers, where `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]. The actual values in the list depend on user input, but `cards` will contain exactly `n` integers. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `cards` is a list of `n` integers based on user input.**
