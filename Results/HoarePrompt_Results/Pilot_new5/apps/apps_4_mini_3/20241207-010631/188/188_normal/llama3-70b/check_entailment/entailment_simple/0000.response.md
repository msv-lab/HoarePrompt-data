To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the problem description, we need to analyze if it fulfills the requirements for deciding whether Petya and Vasya can make the game fair.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Petya and Vasya must choose distinct integers from the cards.
2. The game is fair if there are exactly two distinct integers such that each integer occurs exactly n/2 times.
3. If it's not possible to have two distinct integers with each occurring n/2 times, the program should output "NO".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an even integer `n` and then reads `n` integers into a list `a`. This part is correct.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - A dictionary `d` is created to count how many times each integer appears in the list. This is also correct.

3. **Finding Suitable Integers**:
   - The program checks for keys in the dictionary `d` that have counts equal to `n // 2`.
   - It is supposed to find two distinct integers (`a1` and `a2`) that each occur exactly `n // 2` times.
   - If found, it prints "YES" followed by these integers; if not found, it prints "NO".

### Critical Examination:
- The program's logic for finding `a1` and `a2` is flawed. The condition `if d[i] == n // 2:` only allows for capturing integers that occur exactly `n // 2` times.
- However, the program doesn't enforce that these integers must be distinct in the final check. It simply finds the first two integers matching the count without ensuring they are different, which could lead to a case where both integers chosen are the same, violating the requirement of distinct choices for Petya and Vasya.

### Example of Failure Case:
1. For an input like:
   ```
   4
   1
   1
   2
   2
   ```
   The program would find `1` and `2`, both occurring `2` times, and print them as `1 2`. This situation is correct.
   
2. However, for an input like:
   ```
   4
   1
   1
   1
   1
   ```
   The program would output "NO", which is also correct, as there are no two distinct integers.
   
3. The critical failure case arises when there are two integers, but they do not both occur `n // 2` times, yet the program does not check well enough to ensure that they are distinct in the context required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly enforce the requirement that the two selected integers must be distinct. Thus, it may output results that do not satisfy the conditions outlined in the problem description for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
