The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`, which means that `a1` will take on that specific key's value. The values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`, and `a1` is equal to the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`, `a1` is equal to the value of `i`.**
