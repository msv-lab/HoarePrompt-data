The code prints the two most frequent integers in `unique_numbers`, which are the last two elements based on their frequency. The state of `n`, `cards`, `count`, and `unique_numbers` remains valid, but the specific values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` are now printed. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `cards` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards`, sorted by their frequency in ascending order; the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2; the count of the most frequent integer is equal to `n // 2`; the count of the second most frequent integer is also equal to `n // 2; 'YES' is printed to the output; unique_numbers[-1] and unique_numbers[-2] are printed.**
