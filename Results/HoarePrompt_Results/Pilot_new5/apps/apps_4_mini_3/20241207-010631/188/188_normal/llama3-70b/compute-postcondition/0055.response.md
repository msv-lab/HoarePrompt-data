Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or a key in `d` for which `d[a1]` equals `n // 2`, and `a2` is either -1 or a key in `d` for which `d[a2]` equals `n // 2`. At least one of `a1` or `a2` is -1, meaning that either `a1` does not exist or `a2` does not exist, or both do not exist.***
