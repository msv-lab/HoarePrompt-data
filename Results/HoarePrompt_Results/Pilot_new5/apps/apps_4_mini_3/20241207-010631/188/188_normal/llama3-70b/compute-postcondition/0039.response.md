The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`, `a1` is equal to the value of `i`, and `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`, `a1` is equal to the value of `i`, `c` is increased by 1**.
