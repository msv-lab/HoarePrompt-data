To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it in detail based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The function must determine if Petya and Vasya can choose two distinct integers such that they can take all n cards and each player gets an equal number of cards.
2. It should output "NO" if they cannot choose such integers or "YES" followed by the two integers if they can.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads the number of cards `n` and the integers written on the cards.
2. It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each integer on the cards.
3. The unique numbers are sorted by their count.
4. It checks:
   - If there are less than 2 unique numbers, it prints "NO".
   - If the two most frequent numbers each occur `n // 2` times, it prints "YES" along with those two numbers.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Issues:
- The check `if len(unique_numbers) < 2:` correctly handles cases with less than two unique numbers, returning "NO" as expected.
- The key check `elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:` looks for the scenario where both the highest and second highest counts of cards are equal to `n // 2`. However, this does not account for cases where there may be multiple integers with adequate counts but not necessarily the top two.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```
Here, each integer occurs exactly twice. The two distinct integers Petya and Vasya can choose are 1 and 2, making it a fair game. But the current logic would output "NO" since it checks the last two unique numbers by their frequency directly without considering that multiple numbers can equally fill the game.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly cover all necessary scenarios outlined by the problem description, specifically when there are multiple numbers with equal counts that could still make the game fair.

Correctness: **False**.
