The code `print('?')` does not alter any variable values; it merely outputs the string `?`. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged initial conditions.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values within the range 0 to 100. The value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`. The value of `z` is greater than 0.**
