The print statement outputs a string `'-'`, but it does not alter any variable states or values. Therefore, the states of all the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`; output is '-'**.
