The code assigns the value of `y` to `min_downvotes`. The initial values are `x`, `y`, and `z` which are integers between 0 and 100. The value of `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
