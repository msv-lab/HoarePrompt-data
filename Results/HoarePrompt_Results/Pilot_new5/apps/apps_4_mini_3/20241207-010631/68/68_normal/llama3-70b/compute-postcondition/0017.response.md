Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, a '-' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, '0' is printed while `x` remains equal to `y`. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` remains less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, ensuring that `x` is distinct from `y`.***
