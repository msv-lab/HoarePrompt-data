The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through standard input, where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs. The function prints '-' if the maximum upvotes (`x + z`) are less than the minimum downvotes (`y`). If the maximum downvotes (`y + z`) are less than the minimum upvotes (`x`), it prints '+'. If neither condition is met, it prints '?'. The function does not return any values but outputs a single character based on the conditions stated.
