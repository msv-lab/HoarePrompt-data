Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values (0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z >= y`); and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z >= x`).***
