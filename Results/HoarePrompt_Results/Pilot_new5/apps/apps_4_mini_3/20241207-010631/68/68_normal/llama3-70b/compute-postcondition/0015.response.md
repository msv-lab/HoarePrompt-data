Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `x` is equal to `y`, and if `z` is 0, the output '0' is printed, maintaining that `x` is equal to `y`. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x`, `y`, and `z` retain their relationships such that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is still less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y` with the additional condition that `x` remains distinct from `y`.***
