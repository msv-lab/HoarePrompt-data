The code `print('-')` does not affect any variables or their values, nor does it change the state of the program aside from producing an output. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values within the range 0 to 100 based on the input provided. The value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`; a '-' has been printed.**
