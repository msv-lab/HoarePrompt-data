The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value of `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Since `y_found` is either True or False, and the code does not change the value of `y_found`, the conditions for adding elements to `new_marks` do not affect the outcome of this specific line of code. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, and we can deduce that `new_marks` now contains the value `mark + y`. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 3 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; if `y_found` is False, `new_marks` contains `mark + x` or `mark - x`, depending on previous conditions; if `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged; and `new_marks` now contains `mark + y`.**
