Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` must contain at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is an empty set, and either `(mark - x + y in marks_set)` or `(mark - x - y in marks_set)` holds true. Additionally, none of the following hold true: `(mark + x + y in marks_set)`, `(mark + x - y in marks_set)`, `(mark - x + y in marks_set)`.***
