The variable `additional_marks` is modified by appending the value of `x`. The initial state indicates that `additional_marks` is an empty list. After executing the code, `additional_marks` will contain one element: `x`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, `marks` is a set of integers with at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` contains the value `x`.**
