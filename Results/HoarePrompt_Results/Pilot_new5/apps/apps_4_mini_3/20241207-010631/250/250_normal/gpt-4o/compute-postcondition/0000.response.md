Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are now assigned values from the input. The list `a` remains a strictly increasing list of `n` integers representing the distances of the marks from the origin, where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l.**
