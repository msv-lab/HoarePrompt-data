The variable `need_x` is assigned the Boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the output state reflects the updated value of `need_x`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`, `need_x` is True**
