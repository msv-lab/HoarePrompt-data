The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `marks`) remain unchanged, and their values are still valid based on the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `need_x` while preserving the integrity of the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements, and the difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the `marks` array is equal to `x`; `need_x` is True.**
