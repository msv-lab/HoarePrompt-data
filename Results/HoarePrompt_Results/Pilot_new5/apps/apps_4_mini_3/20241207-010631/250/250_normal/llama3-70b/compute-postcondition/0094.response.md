Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and `i + j` is not present in the list `marks`.***
