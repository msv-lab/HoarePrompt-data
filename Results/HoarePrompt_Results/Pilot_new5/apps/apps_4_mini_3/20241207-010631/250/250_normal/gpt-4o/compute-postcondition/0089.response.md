Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`. If `new_marks` is not empty, it contains elements derived from applicable expressions combining `marks` with `x` and `y` if `y_found` is False, and the last element removed from `new_marks` is printed. If `new_marks` is empty and `y_found` is False, `result` contains the value `x + y`, and `x_found` remains False; the printed output is the string representation of `result`. If `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged and contains elements only from previous iterations if any were added.***
