The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. Since `mark` is derived from `marks` (which contains at least 2 elements), `mark` is a positive integer. The variable `x` is also defined as a positive integer. Therefore, `mark + x` results in a positive integer that will be added to the `new_marks` set.

The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 2 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; `new_marks` now contains the element `mark + x`.**
