Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the output is 0 printed to the console. Otherwise, if either `x_found` or `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is generated from applicable expressions combining `marks` with `x` and `y` if `y_found` is False, and the last element of `new_marks` is printed if `new_marks` is not empty. If `new_marks` is empty and `y_found` is False, `result` contains the value `x + y`, `x_found` remains False, and the printed output is the string representation of `result`. If `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged and contains elements only from previous iterations if any were added.***
