The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the list `additional_marks`. Given the conditions that `i + j` is currently less than or equal to `l` and is not present in the list `marks`, the value `i + j` will be added to `additional_marks`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, `additional_marks` has at least one element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`.**
