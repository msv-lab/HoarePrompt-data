Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False. The loop continues to process elements in `marks` until all have been evaluated.***
