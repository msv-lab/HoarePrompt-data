Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `marks` contains at least 1 more element. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if either `x_found` or `y_found` is False, there is no change to the state.***
