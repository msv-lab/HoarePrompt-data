Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; if `y_found` is False, `new_marks` contains elements derived from all applicable expressions combining `marks` with `x` and `y`; if `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged and contains elements only from previous iterations if any were added; the output printed is `1`.**
