Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after the current one. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` contains an additional element which is the sum of `i` and `j`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `additional_marks`.***
