Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). If `need_x` is False, then `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, and `additional_marks` contains the value `x`. The current value of `need_y` is False.***
