Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, `additional_marks` has at least one element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`.***
