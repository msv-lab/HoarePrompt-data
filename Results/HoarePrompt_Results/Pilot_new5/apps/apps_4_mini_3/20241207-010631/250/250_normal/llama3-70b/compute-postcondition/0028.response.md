The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state retains their previous conditions. The information regarding `marks`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `y`, and `need_x` stays valid after this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements, the difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the `marks` array is equal to `y`, the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `y`, `need_x` is set to True, `need_y` is True.**
