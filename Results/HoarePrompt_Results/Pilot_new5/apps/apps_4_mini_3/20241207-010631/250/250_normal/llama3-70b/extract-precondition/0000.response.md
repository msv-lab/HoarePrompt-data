Precondition: **n is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), l is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and a is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l) representing the distances of the marks from the origin, with all elements in a being non-negative and less than or equal to l.**
