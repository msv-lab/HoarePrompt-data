According to the code, the loop iterates over each `mark` in the `marks` collection. At the end of the last iteration, the state reflects that the loop has processed one `mark` from the `marks`. Since `marks` contains at least 1 element, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 2 elements in `marks`. 

If the loop has processed one `mark`, the next `mark` to process will be the second element in the `marks` list. Therefore, `mark` needs to be updated to the next element in the `marks` collection.

Since `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are not directly affected by the number of iterations, and `marks_set` is derived from `marks`, the relevant state adjustments are:
- `mark` will now refer to the next element in `marks`.

Let's denote that `mark` is now the next element in the `marks` list, and for the loop to continue executing, `marks` must still contain at least 2 elements.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` contains at least 2 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `mark` is the next element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False.**
