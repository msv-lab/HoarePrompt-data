Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `n-1`. `need_x` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, and `need_y` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`. If the loop does not execute, then `j` remains equal to `n`, and both `need_x` and `need_y` will be False unless they were set to True during the execution.**
