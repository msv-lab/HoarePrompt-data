The code initializes `need_x` and `need_y` to `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is the input positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is the input positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is the input positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `a` is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l), `marks` is a set of integers from input, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False**
