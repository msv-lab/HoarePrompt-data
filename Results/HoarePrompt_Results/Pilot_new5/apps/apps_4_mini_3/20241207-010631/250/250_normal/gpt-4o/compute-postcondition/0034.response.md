To determine the conditions for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the state before the loop and the provided information.

1. The loop iterates over `marks`, which should be a collection (list, set, etc.) of values. For the loop to execute, `marks` must contain at least one element.

2. The variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers, which do not directly affect the execution of the loop since they are not part of the loop statement.

3. The `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, but its specific contents are not known until the loop runs. If `marks` is empty, the loop will not execute, hence `marks` should contain at least one element.

4. The `a` list is strictly increasing and defined with `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, but this information is also not directly relevant to the loop execution since it does not affect `marks`.

5. The boolean flags `x_found` and `y_found` are both set to False initially, and `new_marks` is an empty set. Their values will likely change during the loop, but they don't affect whether the loop runs initially.

Given this analysis, the only necessary adjustment to the state is to ensure that `marks` is non-empty.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` must contain at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is an empty set**.
