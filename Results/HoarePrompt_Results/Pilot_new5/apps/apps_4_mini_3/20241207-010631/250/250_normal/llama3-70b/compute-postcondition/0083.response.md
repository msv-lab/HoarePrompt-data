The code snippet `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. The initial conditions state that the current value of `i` (the second element of `marks`) added to `j` is less than or equal to `l`, and the sum of `i` and `j` is not present in the `marks` list. Therefore, `i + j` is a valid value to be added to `additional_marks`. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `j` is a defined value, `additional_marks` now contains `i + j`, and the sum of `i` and `j` is not present in the `marks` list.**
