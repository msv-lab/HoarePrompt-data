The value of `need_x` is assigned `True`. Other variables such as `n`, `i`, `j`, and `marks` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements, and `need_x` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements, `need_x` is True.**
