Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, and `additional_marks` may contain several elements, each being a unique value calculated as `i + j` for some `j` in the original `additional_marks`, where each result satisfies the condition `i + j <= l` and is not already in `marks`. If no values were added to `additional_marks`, it remains unchanged from its initial state.**
