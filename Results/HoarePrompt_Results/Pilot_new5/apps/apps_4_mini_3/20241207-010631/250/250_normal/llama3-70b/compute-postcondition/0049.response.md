According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3, and `j` is equal to `n`, which means `j` is currently 3 or greater. 

Since `j` starts from `i` and goes up to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will have to be at least 4 for the loop to execute again, and for the loop to be able to execute, `n` must also be greater than 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `need_x` is True and `need_y` is True.**
