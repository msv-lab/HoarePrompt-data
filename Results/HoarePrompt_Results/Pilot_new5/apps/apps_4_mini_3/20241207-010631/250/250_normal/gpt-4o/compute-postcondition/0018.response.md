The variable `y_found` is assigned the value `True`. This means that it has been explicitly set to indicate that whatever condition it was tracking (likely related to the presence of `y` in some context) has been satisfied. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `marks` contains at least 2 elements; `y_found` is True.**
