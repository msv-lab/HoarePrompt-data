According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate with `j` starting from `i` (which is 2) and going up to `n - 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `i` is already set to 2, the loop will execute as long as `j` can take values from 2 up to `n - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following conditions must be satisfied:
1. `n` must be at least 3 so that `j` can have at least one valid value (2).
2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be equal to `n`.

Therefore, we can state the conditions that must hold before the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`**
