The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` contains at least 1 element, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, and both `x_found` is True and `y_found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
