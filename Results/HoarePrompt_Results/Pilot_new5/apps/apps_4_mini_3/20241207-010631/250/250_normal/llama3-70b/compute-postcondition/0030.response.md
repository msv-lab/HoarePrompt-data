To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we analyze the provided information step by step. 

1. The loop is controlled by the variable `j` which starts at the current value of `i` and iterates until it reaches `n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `i` is also 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 2.
4. Since `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `j` (which will be 2) must be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.
5. The `marks` array has at least `n` elements, so it can accommodate the indices being used in the loop.
6. The variables `need_x` and `need_y` will be set based on the condition involving the `marks` array. However, the provided details indicate that if the condition holds true, both `need_x` and `need_y` will be set to `True`, but there is no need for modification of their current state unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements.**
