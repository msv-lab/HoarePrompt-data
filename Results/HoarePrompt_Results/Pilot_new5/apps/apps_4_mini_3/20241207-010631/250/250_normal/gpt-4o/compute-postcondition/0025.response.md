The code sets `y_found` to `True`, which changes its previous value (which was not specified). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this modification.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `marks` contains at least 1 more element; if `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is set to True; `y_found` is True.**
