The line of code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the list `additional_marks`. Given the initial state, `i` is the first element of `marks`, and `j` is the second element of `additional_marks`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `marks` and `additional_marks` have the required elements, the states of `marks` and `additional_marks` will remain intact except for `additional_marks`, which will have one more element added.

The value appended to `additional_marks` will be `i + j`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the second element of `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now has one additional element equal to `i + j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the second element of `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements with the last element being equal to `i + j`.**
