The code appends the result of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. The value of `i` is the second element of `marks`, and since `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, it can be any value based on the current state of `additional_marks`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`.**
