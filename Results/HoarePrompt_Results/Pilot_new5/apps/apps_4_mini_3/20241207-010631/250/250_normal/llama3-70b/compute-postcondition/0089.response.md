The value of `i` is assigned as the second element of `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after the current one. The operation `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` as a new element to the `additional_marks` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks after the current one`, and `additional_marks` now contains an additional element which is the sum of `i` and `j`.**
