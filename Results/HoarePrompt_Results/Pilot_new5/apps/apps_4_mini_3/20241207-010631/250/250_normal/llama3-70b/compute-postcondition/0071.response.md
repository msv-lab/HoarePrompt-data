The code appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Since the current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`, the append operation will successfully add this new value to `additional_marks`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `additional_marks` now contains at least one more element which is `i + j`.**
