Otherwise, if either `x_found` or `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is generated from applicable expressions combining `marks` with `x` and `y` if `y_found` is False, and the last element of `new_marks` is printed if `new_marks` is not empty. If `new_marks` is empty and `y_found` is False, `result` contains the value `x + y`, `x_found` remains False, and the printed output is the string representation of `result`. If `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged and contains elements only from previous iterations if any were added.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and a list `marks` of `n` integers. It checks if there are any marks that can reach either `x` or `y` distances from another mark. If both distances can be reached, it prints `0`. If either distance cannot be reached, it attempts to generate new marks based on the existing ones and prints a new valid mark if available, or returns the values `x` and `y` if no new marks can be created. The function handles the scenario of not finding any valid marks by outputting `x` and `y` when necessary.
