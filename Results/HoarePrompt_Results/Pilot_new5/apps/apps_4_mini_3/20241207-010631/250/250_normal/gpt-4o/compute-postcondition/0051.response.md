Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `new_marks` will contain `mark + y` if any of `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` exists in `marks_set`. If none of these conditions are satisfied, then `new_marks` will be updated to include `mark - y` if either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in `marks_set`; otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
