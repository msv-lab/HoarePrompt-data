According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `marks`. The loop will execute if the set `marks_set` (which is derived from `marks`) is not empty. Thus, for the loop to be executed, `marks` must contain at least one element. 

At the beginning of the loop, `mark` will take on the value of each element in `marks`. Since we are given the information that `x_found` and `y_found` are both set to False, we also need to consider their states at the start of the loop.

For the loop to execute, we need:
- `marks` must contain at least 1 element.
- `mark` will be the first element in `marks`.
- `x_found` can remain False (unless specified in the loop body).
- `y_found` can remain False (unless specified in the loop body).

Based on this reasoning, the state can be expressed as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l, marks` must have at least 1 element, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False**.
