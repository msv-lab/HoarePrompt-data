Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 3 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; if `y_found` is False, `new_marks` will contain `mark + y` if either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`. If none of those conditions are met but `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` will contain `mark - y`. If `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
