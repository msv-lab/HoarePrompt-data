To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given state before the loop and the loop structure itself.

- The loop is iterating over `additional_marks`, which is an iterable.
- The state before the loop indicates that `marks` is a list containing at least one element, and `i` is set to the first element of this list.
- However, the state does not provide information about `additional_marks`, which is crucial for the loop execution. 

For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must be defined and contain at least one element. Since the current state does not mention `additional_marks` at all, we cannot assume its properties.

Thus, we need to ensure that `additional_marks` exists and is not empty, while keeping the other states intact.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `additional_marks` must be defined and contain at least 1 element**.
