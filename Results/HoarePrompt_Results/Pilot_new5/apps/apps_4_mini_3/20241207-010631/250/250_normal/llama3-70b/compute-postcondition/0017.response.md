The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `need_x` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `need_x` is True.**
