The code `print(0)` outputs the integer `0` to the console but does not change any of the variable states. The values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged and continue to be non-negative integers, and `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` retain their values as assigned from user input converted to integers. The condition that the current value of `cnt3` is greater than the current value of `cnt1` still holds.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are assigned values from user input converted to integers; the current value of `cnt3` is greater than the current value of `cnt1`.**
