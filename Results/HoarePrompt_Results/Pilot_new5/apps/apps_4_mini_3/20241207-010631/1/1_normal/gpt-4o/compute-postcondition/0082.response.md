Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, and `i` is less than or equal to `ind`. If either `start_colon` or `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, the program identifies that the colons are not properly positioned. Otherwise, `start_colon` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `bind`, `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 1`, `pipe_count` is the count of the '|' characters found between `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon - 1`, and `result`, which is equal to `4 + pipe_count`, has been printed.***
