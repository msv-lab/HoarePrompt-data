According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, meaning there is at least one iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2**
