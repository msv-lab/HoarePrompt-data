The variable `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `bind - 3`, the value of `end_colon` becomes equal to `bind - 3`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged and their previous values are still valid. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is equal to `bind - 3`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range; `end_colon` is equal to `bind - 3`.**
