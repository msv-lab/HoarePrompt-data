The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is equal to `bind - 3`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range; `end_colon` is equal to `bind - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
