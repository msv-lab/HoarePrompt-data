The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `ind + 3` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 3`, `start_colon` is `ind + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
