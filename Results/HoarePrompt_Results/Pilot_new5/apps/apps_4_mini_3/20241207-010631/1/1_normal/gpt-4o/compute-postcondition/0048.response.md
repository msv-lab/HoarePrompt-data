Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `ind + 3` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 3`, and if `s[i]` is a colon, then `start_colon` is set to `ind + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
