The variable `bind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is equal to `n - 3`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be a positive integer (specifically, at least `-1`). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `bind` is equal to `n - 3`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `bind` is equal to `n - 3`.**
