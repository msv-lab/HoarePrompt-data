According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. The loop index `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`. Since `ind` is initialized to -1 and does not affect loop execution directly, the important variables to note are `s` and `n`. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, which means that the string `s` must have at least one character. At the start of the first iteration, `i` will be 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with length `n` greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ind` is -1**
