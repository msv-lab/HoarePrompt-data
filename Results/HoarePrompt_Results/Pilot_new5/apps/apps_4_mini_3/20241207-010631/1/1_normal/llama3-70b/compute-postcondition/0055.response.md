Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n - 3`; if `s[i]` is equal to ':', then if `f` is true, `bind` is set to `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else condition to consider.***
