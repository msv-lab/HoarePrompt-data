Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |. It searches for the first `:` after a `[` and the last `:` before a `]`. If either `:` is not found, or if the first `:` is not before the last `:`, it prints -1. If the conditions are met, it counts the number of `|` characters between the first `:` and the last `:` (exclusive) and adds 4 to this count before printing the result. If there are no `|` characters, it will print 4. **
