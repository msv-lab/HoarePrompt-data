According to the code, the loop iterates starting from `bind - 1` down to `ind + 1` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `bind - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making `i` equal to `bind - 3`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must still be greater than `ind`. Given that `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', there are no additional constraints on `bind` since it is already greater than `ind + 1`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be decremented to `bind - 3`.

State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is equal to `bind - 3`, and `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range.**
