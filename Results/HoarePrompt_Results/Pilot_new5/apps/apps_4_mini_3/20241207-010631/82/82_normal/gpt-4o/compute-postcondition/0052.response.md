Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9, a != b), `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `candidate` is equal to k + 1, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is assigned the value from func_2(new_a, new_b), `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
