To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
Neko needs to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are multiple \( k \) values yielding the same LCM, Neko should select the smallest \( k \).

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes \( k = 0 \) and calls `func_2(a, b)` to compute the initial minimum LCM (`min_lcm`).
3. **Loop for Minimization**:
   - It enters an infinite loop where it calculates the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).
   - If the new LCM is smaller than `min_lcm`, it updates `min_lcm` and increments \( k \).
   - If it finds a \( k \) for which the LCM no longer decreases, the loop breaks, and \( k - 1 \) is printed.

### Function Definitions
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Calculates the LCM using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

### Edge Cases to Consider
While analyzing the code, a few edge cases come to mind:
1. **When \( a = b \)**: In this case, the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) will always equal \( a + k \) (since they are the same). The optimal \( k \) should be \( 0 \) because \( \text{LCM}(a, a) = a \) is minimized at \( k = 0\).
2. **Large Values**: The problem constraints allow \( a \) and \( b \) to go up to \( 10^9 \). The program must efficiently handle large inputs without excessive computations.
3. **Incrementing \( k \)**: The program increments \( k \) until it finds a non-decreasing LCM. However, there's no guarantee that the first encountered minimum LCM is necessarily the global minimum for larger values of \( k \).

### Issues Found
1. The program has a potential issue with its handling of the loop incrementing \( k \). If there exists a \( k \) that gives a smaller LCM beyond the immediate next values, the program would break out of the loop without checking those further values. This means it might miss optimal \( k \) values that yield a smaller LCM.
2. The annotations state that `a` and `b` will always be positive integers, but they do not explicitly mention handling ties in LCM values correctly.

### Conclusion
Given these points, I see that the program's logic for finding the minimum LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is flawed due to the way it exits the loop. It may incorrectly conclude a \( k \) because it does not guarantee checking beyond the immediate decrease in LCM values.

Thus, the program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
