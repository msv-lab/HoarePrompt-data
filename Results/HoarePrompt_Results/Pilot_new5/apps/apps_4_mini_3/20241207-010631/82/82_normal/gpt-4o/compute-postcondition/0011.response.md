To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the line `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` on the initial state. 

1. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and the `candidate` variable, but since we have not been provided with the value of `candidate` or the actual function `func_2`, we will not know their specific values. However, we know that `new_a` and `new_b` are computed based on the existing values of `a` and `b`.

2. The `current_lcm` variable will store the result of the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The specific value of `current_lcm` will depend on the implementation of `func_2`, which has not been provided.

3. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state will acknowledge that `current_lcm` is assigned a value based on a function applied to `new_a` and `new_b`, while leaving all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
