In the provided code snippet, `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the task's initial state. Therefore, we can conclude the following for the output state:

- `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`.
- `a` remains an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`.
- `b` remains an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is still the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_k` remains unchanged.
- `candidate` is still `diff // k`.
- `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` remains unchanged, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
