The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` when `b` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return the GCD of these values when `b` is 0, which results in returning `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the GCD of `a` and `b` when `b` is 0, which is `a`.**
