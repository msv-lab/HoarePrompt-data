The variable `new_b` is assigned the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The value of `b` is an integer that satisfies `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and since `candidate` is a divisor of `diff`, the impact of this operation will be to round `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected directly by this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
