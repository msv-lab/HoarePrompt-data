The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers with constraints such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). The function returns the result of the expression \( \frac{a \times b}{\text{func\_1}(a, b)} \). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers, `a` and `b`, and return the result of \( a \) multiplied by \( b \) divided by the result of a function `func_1(a, b)`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, and returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by the result of func_1(a, b).**
