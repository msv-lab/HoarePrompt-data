#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0. Therefore, the return value is 'a', which is the GCD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function effectively handles the case where `b` is initially 0, returning `a` as the GCD if that is the case, although by the constraints it will always be positive. Therefore, it computes the GCD for any pair of positive integers within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by the result of func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (both in the range from 1 to 10^9) and returns the result of `a` multiplied by `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. It is important to note that if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, this will lead to a division by zero error.
