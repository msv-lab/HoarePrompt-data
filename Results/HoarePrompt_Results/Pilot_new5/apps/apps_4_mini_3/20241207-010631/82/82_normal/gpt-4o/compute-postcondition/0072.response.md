Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is calculated as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is assigned to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is assigned to `candidate`.***
