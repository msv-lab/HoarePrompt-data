Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) with `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, and `current_lcm` is equal to func_2(new_a, new_b). If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
