The variable `new_b` is assigned the value calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The previous values of `b` and `candidate` will determine the new value of `new_b`. The variables `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `current_lcm`, and `new_a` remain unchanged.

Since `candidate` is defined as `diff // k`, we do not have specific values for `diff` or `k`, so `candidate` remains an expression. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the value assigned after processing the previous candidate, `min_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_k` remains unchanged, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the value assigned after processing the previous candidate, `min_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_k` remains unchanged, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
