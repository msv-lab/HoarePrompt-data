Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and the current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or, if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm`, then the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
