Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9) with `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by func_2(new_a, new_b), if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
