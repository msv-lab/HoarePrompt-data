The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `candidate` is `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `candidate` is `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`**.
