The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function effectively handles the case where `b` is initially 0, returning `a` as the GCD if that is the case, although by the constraints it will always be positive. Therefore, it computes the GCD for any pair of positive integers within the specified range.
