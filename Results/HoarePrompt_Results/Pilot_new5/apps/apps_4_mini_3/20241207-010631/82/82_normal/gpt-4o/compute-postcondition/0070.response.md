The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of `a`, `b`, `k`, `diff`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `candidate` is calculated as `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is calculated as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `candidate` is calculated as `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is calculated as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
