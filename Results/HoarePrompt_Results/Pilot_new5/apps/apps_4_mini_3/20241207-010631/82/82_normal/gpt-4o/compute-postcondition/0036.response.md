To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, we need to analyze the changes made by the code.

The initial state specifies the following:
- `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9)
- `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9)
- `a != b`
- `k` is incremented by 1 and must be <= `int(math.sqrt(diff))`
- `diff` is a positive value derived from the absolute difference between `a` and `b`
- `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`

The code executes the following:
```
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```
This line assigns the result of the function `func_2` called with `new_a` and `new_b` to `current_lcm`. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `candidate`.

Since `current_lcm` is the only variable being assigned a new value in this line, we have:
- `current_lcm` is defined by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are derived from `a` and `b`, but their specific numerical values depend on the `candidate`, which is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot specify `new_a` and `new_b` without knowing `candidate`. We can only indicate that they are calculated values based on `a`, `b`, and `candidate`.

After executing this line, the precondition remains valid, and we summarize the state while noting that `current_lcm` now holds the value determined by the function `func_2`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9), `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be <= int(math.sqrt(diff)), `diff` is a positive value derived from abs(a - b), `new_a` is equal to (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is equal to (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is equal to func_2(new_a, new_b)**.
