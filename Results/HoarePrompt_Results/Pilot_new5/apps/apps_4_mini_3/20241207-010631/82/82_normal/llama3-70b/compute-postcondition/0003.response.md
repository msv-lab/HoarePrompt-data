The statement `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment where `a` takes the value of `b` and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is the previous value of `b` (let's denote it as `a = previous_b`)
- `b` must be less than the previous value of `a` (let's denote this as `b < previous_a`)

After executing the statement:
1. `a` will be updated to the current value of `b`.
2. `b` will be updated to the result of `a % b`, which involves the original value of `a`.

Since `a` was initialized to the previous value of `b`, and we also know that `b` is less than the previous value of `a`, the value of `a % b` will yield a non-negative result that is less than `b`.

Thus, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` after the assignment while retaining the valid state of the previous variables.

Output State: **`a` is the current value of `b`; `b` is equal to `previous_a % b`, with the constraint that `b` continues to be less than `previous_a`.**
