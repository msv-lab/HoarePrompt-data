Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`. If the loop executes, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated from valid candidates, and `min_k` is the candidate that resulted in `min_lcm`. If the loop does not execute, `min_lcm` remains positive infinity and `min_k` remains 0.**
