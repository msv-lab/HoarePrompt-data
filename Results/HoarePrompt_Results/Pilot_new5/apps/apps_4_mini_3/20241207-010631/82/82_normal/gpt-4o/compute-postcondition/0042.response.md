To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the pre-existing variables:

Initial State: `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) with `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `new_a` is calculated as (a + k - 1) // k * k, `new_b` is calculated as (b + k - 1) // k * k, `current_lcm` is equal to func_2(new_a, new_b), `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`

The code to evaluate is:
```
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

1. The variable `candidate` is equal to `diff // k` based on the initial state.
2. The expression `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` takes the current value of `a` and adjusts it by the value of `candidate`. 
3. Specifically, `new_a` is recalculated based on the updated value of `candidate`.

After executing the code, we update the value of `new_a` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Given `new_a` is now defined as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, it reflects the updated calculation based on the initial value of `a` and `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9) with `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate.**
