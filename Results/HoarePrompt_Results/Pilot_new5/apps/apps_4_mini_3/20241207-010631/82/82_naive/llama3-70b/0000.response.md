To verify the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

The problem requires finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. If multiple values of \( k \) yield the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be returned.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \) correctly.

2. **LCM Calculation**: 
   - The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct.
   - The function `func_2` calculates the LCM using the relationship \( \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{gcd}(x, y)} \), which is also correct.

3. **Finding the Minimum LCM**:
   - The `while True` loop starts with \( k = 0 \) and computes the LCM for \( a+k \) and \( b+k \).
   - It checks if the current LCM is smaller than the previously recorded minimum LCM. If it is, it updates the minimum and increments \( k \). If not, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints \( k - 1 \).

### Potential Case for Incorrectness

The loop increments \( k \) indefinitely until it finds an LCM that does not improve. However, it does not properly handle the condition when all tested \( k \) values result in the same minimum LCM after the initial one. Specifically, it prints \( k - 1 \), which can give incorrect results when no increment could achieve a smaller LCM.

For example:
- Consider \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \):
  - The process might yield \( k = 2 \) with LCM 24, but if \( k = 3 \) and above continue to yield 24, the loop will terminate and print \( k - 1 = 1 \) instead of the correct \( k = 2 \).

### Conclusion

Due to the improper handling of the output when the LCM does not decrease, the program does not correctly return the smallest \( k \) for all potential inputs, especially when multiple \( k \) values yield the same LCM.

Correctness: **False**.
