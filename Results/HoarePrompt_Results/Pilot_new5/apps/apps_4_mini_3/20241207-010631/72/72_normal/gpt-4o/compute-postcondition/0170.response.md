Functionality: ** The function accepts five parameters: integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (where `n` and `m` are between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18), and integers `x` and `y` (where `x` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `y` is between 1 and `m` inclusive). It calculates the number of questions Sergei can answer based on the number of full cycles completed in `k` steps, and how many remaining steps are left. The function returns the maximum and minimum number of questions Sergei can answer, as well as the actual number of questions he answers at the specified position `(x, y)` during the process. The calculations consider the direction of movement (up and down) within the range defined by `n` and `m`, and handle cases where `n` equals 1 differently from cases where it is greater than 1.**
