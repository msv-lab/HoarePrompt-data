Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, and `sergei_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)` if `x` is 0 or `n - 1`. Otherwise, if `x` is between 1 and `n-2`, `sergei_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`.***
