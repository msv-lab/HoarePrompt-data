The value of `min_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`. The variable `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, and since `k` is a positive integer up to \(10^{18}\) and `full_cycle_length` is defined based on the values of `n` and `m`, `min_questions` will also be a non-negative integer. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `full_cycle_length` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycle_length` is either (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 or m if n = 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, and `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
