`max_questions` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `col`, `remaining_questions`, and `sergei_questions` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-2`, `col` is equal to `y + 2`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-2`, `col` is equal to `y + 2`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1.**
