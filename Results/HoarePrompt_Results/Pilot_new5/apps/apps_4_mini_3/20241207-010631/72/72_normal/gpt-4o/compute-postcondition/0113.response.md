The variable `direction` is assigned the value 1. This does not affect any previously existing values of other variables, but it indicates that `direction` is now set to 1. All other variables retain their previous states, and the information that `row` has been increased by `direction` still holds.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 101 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is equal to `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by 1, and `direction` is 1.**
