To calculate the value of `max_asked`, we analyze the expression `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. Here, `k` is an integer in the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. The expression uses integer division. 

The impact of the code is that `max_asked` is computed based on the values of `k` and `n`. Since `m`, `x`, and `y` are not used in this calculation, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ m), `max_asked` is equal to (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)**
