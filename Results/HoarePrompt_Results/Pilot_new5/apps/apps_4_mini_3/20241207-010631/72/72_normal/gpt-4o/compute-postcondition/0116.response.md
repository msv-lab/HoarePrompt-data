Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 101 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is equal to `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1. If `direction` is equal to 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is decreased by 3 and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` is -1, then `row` is increased by 2 and `direction` is set to 1.***
