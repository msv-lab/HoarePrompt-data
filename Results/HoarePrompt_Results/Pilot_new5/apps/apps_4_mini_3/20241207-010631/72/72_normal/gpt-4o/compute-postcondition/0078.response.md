The code assigns the value of `-1` to `direction`. The previous value of `direction` was `1`, so now it changes. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `row` has been incremented or decremented based on the value of `direction`, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is incremented based on the matches found during the iterations, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, and the current value of `row` is equal to `n`.
