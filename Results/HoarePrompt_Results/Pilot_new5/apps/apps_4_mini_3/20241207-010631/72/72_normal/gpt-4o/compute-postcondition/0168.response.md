The provided code snippet is a print statement that outputs the values of `max_questions`, `min_questions`, and `sergei_questions`. However, the values of `min_questions` and `max_questions` are not defined in the initial state or within the print statement. Therefore, their values remain unchanged or unspecified after execution. 

The only relevant variable that can affect the output is `sergei_questions`, which reflects the total number of matches found during all iterations, but its value is not modified by this print operation.

Since the print statement does not change any variables, the output state will reflect all initially defined variables alongside the printed variables, which could be considered unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `row` oscillates between 0 and `n-1`, `col` is equal to `m - 1`, `sergei_questions` reflects the total number of matches found during all iterations, `direction` is either 1 or -1 depending on the final oscillation, `remaining_questions` is less than or equal to 0, `max_questions` remains unchanged, `min_questions` remains unchanged.**
