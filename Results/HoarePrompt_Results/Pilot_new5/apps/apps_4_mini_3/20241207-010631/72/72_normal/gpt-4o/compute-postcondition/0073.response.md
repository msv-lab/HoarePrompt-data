Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `row` oscillates between 0 and `n-1`, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is incremented based on the matches found during the iterations, `direction` will be either 1 or -1 based on the final oscillation, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, and `max_questions` reflects the updated net result of increments and decrements during the loop. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
