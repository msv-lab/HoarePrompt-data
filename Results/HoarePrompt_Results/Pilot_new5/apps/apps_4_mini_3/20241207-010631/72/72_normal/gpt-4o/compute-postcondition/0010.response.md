To evaluate the impact of the code on the initial state, let's break down the assignment:

1. `max_questions` is being assigned a new value based on the expression `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.
2. The variable `full_cycles` is already defined as `k // full_cycle_length`, and `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`. Therefore, `full_cycles` can be expressed as `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`.

Now, we will analyze the initial state:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `k` is a positive integer up to \(10^{18}\).
- `x` is between 0 and `n-1`.
- `y` is between 0 and `m-1`.
- `full_cycle_length` = \((2 * n - 2) * m\).
- `full_cycles` = \(k // full_cycle_length\).
- `remaining_questions` = \(k \% full_cycle_length\).
- `min_questions` = \(full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)\).
- `max_questions` is updated with the new calculation.

Now we can express `max_questions` using the value of `full_cycles`:
- Since `full_cycles` = \(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)\), substituting into `max_questions` gives:

\[
max_questions = \left(\frac{k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1}{(2 * n - 2)}\right)
\]

Thus, the state of `max_questions` is now defined in relation to `k`, `n`, and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycle_length` is equal to (2 * n - 2) * m, `full_cycles` is equal to k // ((2 * n - 2) * m), `remaining_questions` is equal to k % ((2 * n - 2) * m), `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is equal to (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)**.
