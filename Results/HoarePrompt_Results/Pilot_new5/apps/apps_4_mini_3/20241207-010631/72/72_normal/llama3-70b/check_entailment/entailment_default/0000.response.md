The provided code defines a function that is supposed to calculate the number of questions asked to pupils in a classroom setting based on a specific asking order. The implementation of the logic seems to handle the basic operations as described, but there are potential issues based on the problem description and the expected behavior in certain edge cases.

First, let's analyze the code in light of the problem description:

1. **Maximum Questions Asked**: The calculation for `max_asked` seems to be the total questions divided by the total number of rows, which might not accurately reflect the distribution since the distribution is affected by the total number of pupils. The logic should distribute the questions across both the upward and downward polling.

2. **Minimum Questions Asked**: The formula for `min_asked` calculates a minimum based on `max_asked`, but it doesn't account for the fact that if `k` is small relative to the number of pupils, some pupils might not get asked at all. This can lead to a situation where the minimum is inaccurately reported.

3. **Questions Asked by Sergei**: The logic for calculating how many times Sergei is asked assumes certain distributions based on the position in the queue but does not take into account the possibility that Sergei might not get asked at all in fewer `k` questions, especially if his position is unfavorable in relation to the total pupils.

As for the edge cases:
- If `y > m`, which means Sergei's position exceeds the number of pupils in a row, the function does not account for this scenario, which would lead to incorrect results.
  
Now let's evaluate the output hints:
- The output hints suggest that the function calculates maximum and minimum questions accurately; however, since the calculations can produce inaccurate values especially in edge cases (e.g., where pupil counts are fewer than `k`), the output hints don't adequately reflect the real behavior of the function.

Based on this analysis:
- The function does not account for cases where the row position exceeds the number of pupils in that row, indicating that the function's correctness cannot be guaranteed across all possible inputs as described. 

Thus, there are cases (e.g., `y > m`) where the program will not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
