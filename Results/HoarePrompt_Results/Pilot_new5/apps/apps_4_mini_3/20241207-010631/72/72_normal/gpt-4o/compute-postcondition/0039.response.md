Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`. If `direction` is 1 and `row` equals `n`, then `row` is set to `n - 2`, `col` remains `y`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is set to -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, and `max_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1 and `row` equals -1, then `row` is updated to `x + 3`. If neither condition is met, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
