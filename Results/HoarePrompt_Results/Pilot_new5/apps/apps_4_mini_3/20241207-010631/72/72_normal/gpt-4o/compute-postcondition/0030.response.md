The variable `row` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `row` was equal to `n`, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. Therefore, after decrementing `row` by 2, its new value will be `n - 2`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `row` is equal to `n - 2`, `col` is equal to `y`, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, and the current value of `row` is equal to `n`.**
