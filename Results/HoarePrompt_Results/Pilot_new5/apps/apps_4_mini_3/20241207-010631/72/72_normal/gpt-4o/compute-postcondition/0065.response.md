The value of `row` is increased by 2. The previous value of `row` is not specified, but it was incremented by 1 in the prior state. Therefore, the new value of `row` will be the previous value plus 3.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:  
`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-2`, `col` is equal to `y + 2`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-2`, `col` is equal to `y + 2`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by 3.**
