Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`. If `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2`, `col` remains 0, `sergei_questions` is incremented based on the matches found during iterations, `direction` is set to -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, and `max_questions` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
