#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the number of rows and pupils per row respectively, k is a positive integer representing the number of questions asked, x is an integer representing the row number of Sergei (1-indexed), and y is an integer representing the position of Sergei in that row (1-indexed). The constraints are: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five integers: `n` (number of rows), `m` (pupils per row), `k` (number of questions asked), `x` (Sergei's row number, 1-indexed), and `y` (Sergei's position in that row, 1-indexed). It calculates and prints three values: the maximum number of questions asked by any pupil (`max_asked`), the minimum number of questions asked by any pupil (`min_asked`), and the number of questions asked by Sergei (`sergei_asked`). The calculations take into account the constraints on the inputs, but there is no validation for cases where `y` exceeds `m`, which could be considered a potential edge case. The function does not provide any return value but prints the results directly.
