Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` has been incremented by 1. If `direction` is 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` is decreased by 3. Otherwise, if `direction` is -1, `max_questions` has been decremented by 1, and if `row` was -1, then `row` is increased by 1.***
