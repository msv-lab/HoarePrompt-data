The function accepts five integers: `n` (number of rows), `m` (pupils per row), `k` (number of questions asked), `x` (Sergei's row number, 1-indexed), and `y` (Sergei's position in that row, 1-indexed). It calculates and prints three values: the maximum number of questions asked by any pupil (`max_asked`), the minimum number of questions asked by any pupil (`min_asked`), and the number of questions asked by Sergei (`sergei_asked`). The calculations take into account the constraints on the inputs, but there is no validation for cases where `y` exceeds `m`, which could be considered a potential edge case. The function does not provide any return value but prints the results directly.
