According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos`. The loop will execute if the `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, as it iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos` inclusively with a step of `k`. 

Since `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, it will always be a positive integer. The variables `reachable` and `line` do not impact the execution of the loop directly in this context. 

For the loop to execute:
1. `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos` (i.e., `G_pos <= T_pos`).
2. Since `pos` is initialized at `G_pos`, it will be equal to `G_pos` at the start of the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state would include a relationship between `G_pos` and `T_pos`.

State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is False, `pos` is `G_pos`**.
