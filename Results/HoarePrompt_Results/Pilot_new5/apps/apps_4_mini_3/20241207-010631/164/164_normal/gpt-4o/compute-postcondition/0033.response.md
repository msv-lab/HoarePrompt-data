Postcondition: ***`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`. If `reachable` is True, then there exists a path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` without encountering '#', `pos` is equal to the last position checked in the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos` at the last step before the loop ended, and 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if `reachable` is False, `pos` is equal to `G_pos` and 'NO' has been printed.***
