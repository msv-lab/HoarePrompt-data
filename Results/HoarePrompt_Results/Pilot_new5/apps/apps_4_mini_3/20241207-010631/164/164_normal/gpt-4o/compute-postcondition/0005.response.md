The variables `G_pos` and `T_pos` are being swapped. The previous condition states that `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`. After the operation, `G_pos` will take the value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` will take the value of `G_pos`. Therefore, `G_pos` will now be equal to the previous value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` will now be equal to the previous value of `G_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100; `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`; `line` is a user-defined string input; `G_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `T_pos`; `T_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `G_pos`, and the current value of `G_pos` is less than the current value of `T_pos`.**
