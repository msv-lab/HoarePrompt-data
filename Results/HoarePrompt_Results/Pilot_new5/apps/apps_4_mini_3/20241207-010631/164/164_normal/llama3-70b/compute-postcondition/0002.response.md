The variables `g` and `t` are both assigned the value of `-1`. The initial state of the other variables, `n`, `k`, and `s`, remains unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and n-1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is -1**
