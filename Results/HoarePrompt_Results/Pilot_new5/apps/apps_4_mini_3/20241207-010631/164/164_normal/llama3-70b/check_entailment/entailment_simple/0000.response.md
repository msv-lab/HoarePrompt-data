The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down its functionality and why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two integers, `n` (the number of cells) and `k` (the jump length), and a string `s` that represents the line, which includes the positions of the grasshopper ('G') and the insect ('T').

2. **Finding Positions**: It correctly identifies the indices of 'G' and 'T' in the string by iterating through the string once. This is aligned with the problem requirement that there is exactly one 'G' and one 'T'.

3. **Jump Mechanics**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' (`abs(t - g)`) is divisible by `k`. This is necessary because the grasshopper can only land on cells that are `k` cells apart. If this condition is not fulfilled, the grasshopper cannot reach the insect.
   
4. **Obstacle Check**: The program ensures that all cells encountered during the jumps from 'G' to 'T' are not obstacles ('#'). It does this by evaluating the characters at the indices calculated based on the jump sequence.

5. **Output**: Based on the checks:
   - If both conditions (divisibility by `k` and absence of obstacles) are satisfied, it outputs "YES", indicating that the grasshopper can reach the insect.
   - If any condition fails, it outputs "NO".

In terms of edge cases:
- The program correctly handles the situation where 'G' and 'T' are separated by an obstacle, which would prevent a successful series of jumps.
- It correctly calculates jumps for both leftwards and rightwards movements by using the modulus operation, which is suitable for the problem.

Given all these points, the program adheres to all the specifications of the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**
