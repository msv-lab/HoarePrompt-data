The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 1 and n-1 (inclusive). Additionally, the function processes an input string of length `n` that consists of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', ensuring that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. 

The output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided constraints. Therefore, based on the typical behavior of functions involving such inputs, we can infer possible cases for output, but specific return values need to be clarified further.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 1 and n-1 (inclusive), along with an input string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' appearing exactly once.**
