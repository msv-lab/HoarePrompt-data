The value of `reachable` is assigned `True`, but it is already `True` before the code execution, so there is no change in its value. The states of all the other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is equal to `T_pos + k`.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `pos` is equal to `T_pos + k.**
