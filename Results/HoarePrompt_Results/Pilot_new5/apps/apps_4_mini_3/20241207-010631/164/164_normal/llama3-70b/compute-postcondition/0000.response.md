The code assigns values to `n` and `k` based on input. The values of `n` and `k` are both integers, and `n` is between 2 and 100 (inclusive), while `k` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive). The previous conditions on `n` and `k` remain valid after this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and n-1 (inclusive, updated from input)**
