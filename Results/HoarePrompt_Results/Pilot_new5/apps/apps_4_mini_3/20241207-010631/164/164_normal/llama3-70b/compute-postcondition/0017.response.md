The variable `g` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous state indicates that `i` is between 0 and `n-1`, which means `g` will now take on that value. The other variables `n`, `k`, `s`, and `t` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `t` is updated to `n-1`, character at index `i` must be 'T', `i` is between 0 and `n-1`, and `g = i`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `t` is updated to `n-1`, character at index `i` must be 'T', `i` is between 0 and `n-1`, `g = i`**.
