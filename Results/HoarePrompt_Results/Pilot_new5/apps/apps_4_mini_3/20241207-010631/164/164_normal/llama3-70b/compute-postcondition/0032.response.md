Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and `k` (between 1 and `n-1` inclusive), along with a string `s` of length `n` that contains characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' (with 'G' and 'T' appearing exactly once). It checks if it's possible to reach the character 'T' starting from 'G' by moving in increments of `k` positions in the string, wrapping around if necessary, and ensuring there are no '#' characters in the path. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If either 'G' or 'T' is not found in the string, it prints 'NO'.**
