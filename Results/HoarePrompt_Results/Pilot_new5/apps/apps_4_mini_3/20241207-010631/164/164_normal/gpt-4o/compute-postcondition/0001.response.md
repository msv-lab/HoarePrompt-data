The variable `line` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will take a user-defined input as a string. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation, so they remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100; `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`; `line` is a user-defined string input.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100; `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`; `line` is a user-defined string input.**
