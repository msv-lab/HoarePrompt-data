Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of how it meets all specified requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `line`. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies the input format.

2. **Character Positions**: The program correctly identifies the positions of the grasshopper ('G') and the target insect ('T') within the string. It uses `line.index('G')` and `line.index('T')`, ensuring that both characters appear exactly once, as guaranteed by the problem description.

3. **Order of Positions**: The program checks if `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos` and swaps them if necessary. This ensures that the grasshopper's position is always less than or equal to the insect's position, which simplifies the subsequent logic.

4. **Jump Logic**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate from `G_pos` to `T_pos` in steps of `k`. This accurately reflects the grasshopper's ability to jump `k` cells at a time, as described in the problem.

5. **Obstacle Checking**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the current position is an obstacle ('#'). If it encounters an obstacle, it breaks out of the loop, which correctly implements the constraints of the problem where the grasshopper cannot land on non-empty cells.

6. **Reachability Check**: After the loop, it checks whether `pos` reached `T_pos`. If it did, it sets `reachable` to `True`, indicating that the grasshopper can reach the insect without hitting any obstacles.

7. **Output**: Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the insect and 'NO' otherwise. This matches the expected output format specified in the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the mechanics of the grasshopper's jumping, the obstacles, and the final reachability check. It effectively captures all possible scenarios as per the problem statement, making it a valid and correct solution.
