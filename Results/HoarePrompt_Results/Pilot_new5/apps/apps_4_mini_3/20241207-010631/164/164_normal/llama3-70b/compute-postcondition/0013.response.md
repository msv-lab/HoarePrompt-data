`t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n-1`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, so `i` takes on values from 1 to 99. Therefore, `t` will also take on values from 0 to 98 based on the value of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is either 0 or -1, `t` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`**
