The variable `reachable` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, and `T_pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is unchanged, `T_pos` is unchanged, and `reachable` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is unchanged, `T_pos` is unchanged, `reachable` is False.**
