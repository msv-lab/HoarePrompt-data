The variable `reachable` is assigned the value `True`. This does not change any other variables or conditions, as `reachable` was already `True` before this code executed. Therefore, the Output State includes all the valid information from the initial state along with the confirmation that `reachable` remains `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is equal to `G_pos`, and `reachable` is still True.**
