The code `break` indicates that we exit from the most internal loop or if statement we are currently in. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects that we have exited from a loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is False, `pos` is `G_pos`, and the character at position `pos` in `line` is '#', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
