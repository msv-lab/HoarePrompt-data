Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is updated to `n-1`. Otherwise, `g` retains its previous value (either 0 or -1), `t` is updated to `n-1`, and the character at index `i` of string `s` must be 'T' for the condition to be satisfied.***
