To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if a grasshopper can jump from its starting position ('G') to the position of the insect ('T') given the constraints of obstacles ('#') and the jump length ('k'). 

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of cells and jump length and processes the string.
2. **Finding Positions**: It correctly identifies the positions of 'G' and 'T'.
3. **Jump Logic**: 
   - It checks if the distance between 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of 'k'.
   - It checks if the path taken by the grasshopper (using jumps of size 'k') does not encounter any obstacles ('#').
4. **Output**: The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Obstacle Check Logic**: The current program checks if the path from 'G' to 'T' is clear by using:
   ```python
   all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))
   ```
   This condition assumes that the path is circular due to the use of modulo `n`. However, this is not specified in the problem description, which implies a linear path without wrapping around.

2. **Test Case**: If we consider the input:
   ```
   5 2
   G###T
   ```
   Here, the grasshopper starts at position `0`, and the insect is at `4` with jump distance `2`. The grasshopper cannot jump to `2` or `4` because of the obstacles, and the output should be "NO". The proposed program would output "YES" due to incorrect handling of the obstacle check using modulo.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential edge cases as per the problem description, particularly the handling of the linear path and obstacles. 

Correctness: **False**.
