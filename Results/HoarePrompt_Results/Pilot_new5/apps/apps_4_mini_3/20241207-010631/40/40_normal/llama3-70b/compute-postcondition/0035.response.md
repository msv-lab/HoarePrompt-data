The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to `j`, which means `substr = s[2:3]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, `substr` will contain the character at index 2 of the string `s`. The values of the other variables `n`, `max_len`, and indices `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is now 3, and `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s`.**
