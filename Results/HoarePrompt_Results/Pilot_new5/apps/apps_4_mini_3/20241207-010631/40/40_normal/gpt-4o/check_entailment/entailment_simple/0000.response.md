To determine whether the annotated program meets the requirements of the provided problem description, let's examine its functionality in detail.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: A non-empty string `s` containing lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 50.
2. **Output**:
   - If there exists a substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, print the length of the longest such substring.
   - If all substrings are palindromes, print `0`.

### Program Analysis
- The program begins by stripping the input string.
- It checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 1. If true, it prints `0` since single characters or empty strings are inherently palindromes.
- Next, it checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
  - If `s` is not a palindrome, it correctly identifies the length of `s` as the longest non-palindromic substring and prints it.
- Then it checks if the substring `s[1:]` (removing the first character) is not a palindrome.
  - If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints `len(s) - 1` as the longest non-palindromic substring length.
- Finally, it checks if the substring `s[:-1]` (removing the last character) is not a palindrome.
  - If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints `len(s) - 1`.
- If all checks fail, it prints `0`.

### Key Functionality Points
- The `func_1(s)` function correctly determines if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
- The program accounts for edge cases:
  - It handles strings of length 1 by returning `0`.
  - It covers scenarios where the entire string is a palindrome or where removing either the first or last character results in a non-palindromic substring.

### Correctness Check
The program seems to appropriately check for non-palindromic substrings and handle the outputs according to the problem statement. However, there is a potential edge case that could be problematic:
- The program only checks one character removal from either end, but if the string is made up of identical characters (like "aaaa"), both `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]` will still be palindromes. The program will then return `0`, which is correct for those cases but does not fully explore all potential valid non-palindromic substrings that could exist between characters.

### Conclusion
The program correctly identifies the length of the longest non-palindromic substring or returns `0` when appropriate. It adheres strictly to the problem description for all specified cases.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
