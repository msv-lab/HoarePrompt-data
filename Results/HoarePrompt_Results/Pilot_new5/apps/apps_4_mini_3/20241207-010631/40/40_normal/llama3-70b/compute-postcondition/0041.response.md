The variable `max_len` is updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr`, which is derived from `s` using indices 2 to 4, will be 2 because it includes characters at index 2 and index 3 (character at index 4 is not included). Since `max_len` can either remain unchanged or be equal to 1, it will depend on its previous value compared to 2.

If `max_len` was originally 1, it will be updated to 2. If it was originally greater than or equal to 2, it will remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state should reflect the possible outcomes for `max_len` depending on its initial value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to index 4.**
