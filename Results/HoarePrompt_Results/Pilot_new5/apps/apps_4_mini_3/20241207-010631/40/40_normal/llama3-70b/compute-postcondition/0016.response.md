Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length `n` greater than or equal to 3. If the first three characters of `s` (denoted as `substr`) are not a palindrome (i.e., `substr` is not equal to its reverse), then `max_len` is updated to 3, `i` remains 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` remains the first three characters of `s`.***
