Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, and `substr` is the last non-palindromic substring examined during the loop. If no non-palindromic substrings were found, `max_len` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
