To analyze the impact of the code provided:

1. `max_len` is updated by taking the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.
2. The initial value of `max_len` is 2.
3. The substring `substr` is defined as the first three characters of `s`, meaning `len(substr)` is 3 since `n` (length of `s`) is at least 3.

Calculating the new value of `max_len`:
- `max_len` = max(2, 3) = 3.

Thus, the new value of `max_len` is 3, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` that must be greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the first three characters of `s`.**
