The variable `max_len` is initialized to 0. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged as the code does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length at most 50 characters, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length at most 50 characters, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0**.
