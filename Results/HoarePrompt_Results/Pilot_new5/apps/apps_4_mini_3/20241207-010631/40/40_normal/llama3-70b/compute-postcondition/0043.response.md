According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts iterating from `i + 1` (which is 3) and goes up to `n` (which is at least 4). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 5. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is at least 4, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 5.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `max_len` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to index 4.**
