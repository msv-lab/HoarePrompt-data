According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is the character at index 1 of `s`**
