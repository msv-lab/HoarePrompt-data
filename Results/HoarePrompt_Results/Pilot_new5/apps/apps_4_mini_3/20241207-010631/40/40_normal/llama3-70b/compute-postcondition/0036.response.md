Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is now 3, and `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, indicating that the substring formed by the character at index 2 is not a palindrome.***
