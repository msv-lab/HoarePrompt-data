`max_len` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. Given that `max_len` is either 1 or 2, we need to determine the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to index 4, its length will be 3 (assuming `s` has at least 5 characters). Therefore, the possible values for `max_len` before and after the operation will be:

- If `max_len` is 1, after the operation, `max_len` will be updated to 3.
- If `max_len` is 2, after the operation, `max_len` will be updated to 3.

In both cases, `max_len` ends up being 3 after executing the code. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `max_len` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to index 4.**
