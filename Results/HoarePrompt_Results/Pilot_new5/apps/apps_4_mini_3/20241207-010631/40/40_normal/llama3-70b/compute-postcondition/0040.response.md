The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, `substr` will take the characters from index 2 up to (but not including) index 4 of the string `s`. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and the constraints regarding `n` and `max_len` are still valid. Therefore, the output state is updated to reflect the new value of `substr`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is either unchanged or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to index 4.**
