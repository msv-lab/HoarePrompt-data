According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the length of the string `s`, which is greater than 0 since `s` is a non-empty string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n + 1`**
