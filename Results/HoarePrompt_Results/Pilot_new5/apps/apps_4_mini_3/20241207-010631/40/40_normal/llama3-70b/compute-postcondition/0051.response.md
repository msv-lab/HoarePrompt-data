The function `func` accepts a single non-empty string `s` composed of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 50 characters. It calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring within `s`. A substring is considered non-palindromic if it is not identical when read forwards and backwards. If all possible substrings of `s` are palindromic, the function returns 0. The function does not return any value directly; instead, it prints the maximum length found or 0 if no non-palindromic substrings exist. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `s` of lowercase English letters, calculates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring, and prints this length or 0 if all substrings are palindromic. **
