Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to index 4. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, the program retains these conditions.***
