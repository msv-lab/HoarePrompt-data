According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the bounds defined by `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`, which means `j` will be equal to `1` since `i` is currently `0`. The loop will continue executing while `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since `n` is equal to the length of the non-empty string `s`, which is at least `1`, the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the first iteration, `j` will equal `1`, and `j` will then increment until it exceeds `n`.

The initial states that need to be acknowledged for the loop to execute are the values of `i` and `n`. `i` is `0`, and `n` is at least `1`, so `j` will take the values from `1` to `n`. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now `1`, and we must ensure that `n` is at least `1`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` (which is at least 1), `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
