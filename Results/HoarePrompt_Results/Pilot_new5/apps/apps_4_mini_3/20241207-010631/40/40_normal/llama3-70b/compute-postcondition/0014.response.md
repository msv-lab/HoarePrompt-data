`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, which means it takes the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to index `j` (exclusive). The value of `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, so `substr` will contain the first three characters of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` that must be greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the first three characters of `s`.
