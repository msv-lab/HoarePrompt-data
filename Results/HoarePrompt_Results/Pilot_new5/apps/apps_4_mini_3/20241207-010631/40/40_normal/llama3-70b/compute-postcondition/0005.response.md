`substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` that starts at index `i` and ends at index `j`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, `substr` will be the first character of the string `s`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
