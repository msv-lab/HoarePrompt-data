The function `func` accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the list `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is guaranteed to be strictly increasing and falls within the range from 1 to 1000. The function iterates through all possible subarrays of the list `a` to determine the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased, based on the criterion that the difference between the elements and their respective indices must be constant. The function prints the maximum number of elements that can be erased.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 to 100) and a list `a` of `n` strictly increasing integers (1 to 1000), and it calculates and prints the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from `a` based on specific interval conditions. **
