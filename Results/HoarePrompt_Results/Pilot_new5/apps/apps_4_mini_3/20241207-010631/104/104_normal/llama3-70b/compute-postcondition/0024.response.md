To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we start by analyzing the initial state and the code itself.

Initial State: `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4

The code line:
```
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

Here, `j` is 4 and `i` is 1. We calculate `j - i - 1`:
- `j - i - 1` = `4 - 1 - 1` = `2`.

Since we do not have the initial value of `max_erase`, we cannot determine if `max_erase` will be updated based on its previous value, but it will take the maximum value between `max_erase` (whatever it was) and `2`.

The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Given this analysis, we summarize the output state reflecting the unchanged variables and the calculated expression from the code execution:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `max_erase` is updated to max(max_erase, 2)**.
