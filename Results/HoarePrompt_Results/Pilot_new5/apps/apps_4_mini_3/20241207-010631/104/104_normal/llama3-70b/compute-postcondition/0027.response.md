According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2, and the condition for the loop to execute again requires that `i` must still be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_erase` remains unchanged**
