The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate strings. The variable `n` is now an input integer, and it dictates the size of the list `a`. The previous condition that `1 <= n <= 100` still holds true, and now `a` will contain `n` integers based on user input, where each integer is between `1` and `1000` and they remain in increasing order.

Output State: **`n` is now an input integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000 based on user input.**
