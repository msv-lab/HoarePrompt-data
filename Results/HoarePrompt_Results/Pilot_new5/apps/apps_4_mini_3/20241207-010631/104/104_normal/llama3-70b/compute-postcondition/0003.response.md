According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 <= `n` <= 100). The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer and falls within the required bounds, the loop is set to execute properly.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration, and the list `a` must contain integers that satisfy the constraints given (1 <= `a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000). The state of `max_erase` does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100.
- `i` is now 0 (the starting index of the loop).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, max_erase` is 0**
