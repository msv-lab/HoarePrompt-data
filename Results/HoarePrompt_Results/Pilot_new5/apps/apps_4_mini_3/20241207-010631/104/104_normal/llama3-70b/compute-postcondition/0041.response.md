The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). Additionally, the function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] \leq 1000\). After executing the function body, it processes these inputs and returns a result based on the constraints and relationships outlined. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 to 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 to 1000), where the integers in `a` are in strictly increasing order.**
