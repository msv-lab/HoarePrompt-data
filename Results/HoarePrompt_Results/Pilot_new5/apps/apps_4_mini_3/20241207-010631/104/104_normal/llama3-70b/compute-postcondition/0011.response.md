According to the code, the for loop will execute if the variable `j` can take on another value within the range defined by `i + 1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. 

The for loop is defined to start from `i + 1`, which is `1`, and go up to `n + 1`. Since `j` is currently `2`, the next value of `j` will be `3` in the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, `n` needs to be at least `2` to ensure that `j` can be `3` (as it must be greater than `i` which is `0`).

Thus, the new states should be:
- `i` remains `0`, since it does not change in this loop.
- `j` must be updated to `3` for the next iteration.
- `a` remains unchanged, and we still require that `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100` and `n` must be at least `2` to ensure the loop continues.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, max_erase` is 1 if the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true.**
